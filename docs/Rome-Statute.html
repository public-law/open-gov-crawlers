</p>
<p>PREAMBLE
</p>
<p>The States Parties to this Statute, 
</p>
<p> Conscious that all peoples are united by common bonds, their cultures pieced together 
in a shared heritage, and concerned that this delicate mosaic may be shattered at any 
time, 
</p>
<p> Mindful that during this century millions of children, women and men have been 
victims of unimaginable atrocities that deeply shock the conscience of humanity, 
</p>
<p> Recognizing that such grave crimes threaten the peace, security and well-being of 
the world, 
</p>
<p> Affirming that the most serious crimes of concern to the international community as 
a whole must not go unpunished and that their effective prosecution must be ensured 
by taking measures at the national level and by enhancing international cooperation, 
</p>
<p> Determined to put an end to impunity for the perpetrators of these crimes and thus 
to contribute to the prevention of such crimes, 
</p>
<p> Recalling that it is the duty of every State to exercise its criminal jurisdiction over 
those responsible for international crimes, 
</p>
<p> Reaffirming the Purposes and Principles of the Charter of the United Nations, and 
in particular that all States shall refrain from the threat or use of force against the 
territorial integrity or political independence of any State, or in any other manner 
inconsistent with the Purposes of the United Nations, 
</p>
<p> Emphasizing in this connection that nothing in this Statute shall be taken as 
authorizing any State Party to intervene in an armed conflict or in the internal affairs 
of any State, 
</p>
<p> Determined to these ends and for the sake of present and future generations, to 
establish an independent permanent International Criminal Court in relationship with 
the United Nations system, with jurisdiction over the most serious crimes of concern 
to the international community as a whole, 
</p>
<p> Emphasizing that the International Criminal Court established under this Statute 
shall be complementary to national criminal jurisdictions, 
</p>
<p> Resolved to guarantee lasting respect for and the enforcement of international justice, 
</p>
<p>Have agreed as follows:</p>

<p>1. Having regard to paragraph 10 of the Preamble and article 1, the Court shall determine 
that a case is inadmissible where: 
</p>
<p>(a) The case is being investigated or prosecuted by a State which has jurisdiction 
over it, unless the State is unwilling or unable genuinely to carry out the 
investigation or prosecution; 
</p>
<p>(b) The case has been investigated by a State which has jurisdiction over it and 
the State has decided not to prosecute the person concerned, unless the 
decision resulted from the unwillingness or inability of the State genuinely to 
prosecute; 
</p>
<p>(c) The person concerned has already been tried for conduct which is the subject 
of the complaint, and a trial by the Court is not permitted under article 20, 
paragraph 3; 
</p>
<p>(d) The case is not of sufficient gravity to justify further action by the Court.
</p>
<p>2. In order to determine unwillingness in a particular case, the Court shall consider, 
having regard to the principles of due process recognized by international law, whether 
one or more of the following exist, as applicable: 
</p>
<p>(a) The proceedings were or are being undertaken or the national decision 
was made for the purpose of shielding the person concerned from criminal 
responsibility for crimes within the jurisdiction of the Court referred to in 
article 5; 
</p>
<p>(b) There has been an unjustified delay in the proceedings which in the 
circumstances is inconsistent with an intent to bring the person concerned to 
justice; 
</p>
<p>(c) The proceedings were not or are not being conducted independently or 
impartially, and they were or are being conducted in a manner which, in the 
circumstances, is inconsistent with an intent to bring the person concerned to 
justice.
</p>
<p>3. In order to determine inability in a particular case, the Court shall consider whether, 
due to a total or substantial collapse or unavailability of its national judicial system, 
the State is unable to obtain the accused or the necessary evidence and testimony or 
otherwise unable to carry out its proceedings. </p>

<p>Rome Statute of the International Criminal Court
</p>
<p>Article 18 
Preliminary rulings regarding admissibility
</p>
<p>1. When a situation has been referred to the Court pursuant to article 13 (a) and the 
Prosecutor has determined that there would be a reasonable basis to commence an 
investigation, or the Prosecutor initiates an investigation pursuant to articles 13 (c) 
and 15, the Prosecutor shall notify all States Parties and those States which, taking into 
account the information available, would normally exercise jurisdiction over the crimes 
concerned. The Prosecutor may notify such States on a confidential basis and, where 
the Prosecutor believes it necessary to protect persons, prevent destruction of evidence 
or prevent the absconding of persons, may limit the scope of the information provided 
to States. 
</p>
<p>2. Within one month of receipt of that notification, a State may inform the Court that it 
is investigating or has investigated its nationals or others within its jurisdiction with 
respect to criminal acts which may constitute crimes referred to in article 5 and which 
relate to the information provided in the notification to States. At the request of that 
State, the Prosecutor shall defer to the Stateâs investigation of those persons unless 
the Pre-Trial Chamber, on the application of the Prosecutor, decides to authorize the 
investigation. 
</p>
<p>3. The Prosecutorâs deferral to a Stateâs investigation shall be open to review by the 
Prosecutor six months after the date of deferral or at any time when there has been 
a significant change of circumstances based on the Stateâs unwillingness or inability 
genuinely to carry out the investigation. 
</p>
<p>4. The State concerned or the Prosecutor may appeal to the Appeals Chamber against 
a ruling of the Pre-Trial Chamber, in accordance with article 82. The appeal may be 
heard on an expedited basis. 
</p>
<p>5. When the Prosecutor has deferred an investigation in accordance with paragraph 2, the 
Prosecutor may request that the State concerned periodically inform the Prosecutor of 
the progress of its investigations and any subsequent prosecutions. States Parties shall 
respond to such requests without undue delay. 
</p>
<p>6. Pending a ruling by the Pre-Trial Chamber, or at any time when the Prosecutor has 
deferred an investigation under this article, the Prosecutor may, on an exceptional 
basis, seek authority from the Pre-Trial Chamber to pursue necessary investigative 
steps for the purpose of preserving evidence where there is a unique opportunity to 
obtain important evidence or there is a significant risk that such evidence may not be 
subsequently available. 
</p>
<p>7. A State which has challenged a ruling of the Pre-Trial Chamber under this article 
may challenge the admissibility of a case under article 19 on the grounds of additional 
significant facts or significant change of circumstances. 
</p>
<p>Article 19 
Challenges to the jurisdiction of the Court or the admissibility of a case
</p>
<p>1. The Court shall satisfy itself that it has jurisdiction in any case brought before it. The 
Court may, on its own motion, determine the admissibility of a case in accordance 
with article 17.</p>
<p />
</div>
<div class="page"><p />
<p>17
</p>
<p>Rome Statute of the International Criminal Court
</p>
<p>2. Challenges to the admissibility of a case on the grounds referred to in article 17 or 
challenges to the jurisdiction of the Court may be made by: 
</p>
<p>(a) An accused or a person for whom a warrant of arrest or a summons to appear 
has been issued under article 58; 
</p>
<p>(b) A State which has jurisdiction over a case, on the ground that it is investigating 
or prosecuting the case or has investigated or prosecuted; or 
</p>
<p>(c) A State from which acceptance of jurisdiction is required under article 12.
</p>
<p>3. The Prosecutor may seek a ruling from the Court regarding a question of jurisdiction 
or admissibility. In proceedings with respect to jurisdiction or admissibility, those 
who have referred the situation under article 13, as well as victims, may also submit 
observations to the Court. 
</p>
<p>4. The admissibility of a case or the jurisdiction of the Court may be challenged only 
once by any person or State referred to in paragraph 2. The challenge shall take 
place prior to or at the commencement of the trial. In exceptional circumstances, the 
Court may grant leave for a challenge to be brought more than once or at a time later 
than the commencement of the trial. Challenges to the admissibility of a case, at the 
commencement of a trial, or subsequently with the leave of the Court, may be based 
only on article 17, paragraph 1 (c). 
</p>
<p>5. A State referred to in paragraph 2 (b) and (c) shall make a challenge at the earliest 
opportunity. 
</p>
<p>6. Prior to the confirmation of the charges, challenges to the admissibility of a case or 
challenges to the jurisdiction of the Court shall be referred to the Pre-Trial Chamber. 
After confirmation of the charges, they shall be referred to the Trial Chamber. Decisions 
with respect to jurisdiction or admissibility may be appealed to the Appeals Chamber 
in accordance with article 82. 
</p>
<p>7. If a challenge is made by a State referred to in paragraph 2 (b) or (c), the Prosecutor 
shall suspend the investigation until such time as the Court makes a determination in 
accordance with article 17. 
</p>
<p>8. Pending a ruling by the Court, the Prosecutor may seek authority from the Court: 
</p>
<p>(a) To pursue necessary investigative steps of the kind referred to in article 18, 
paragraph 6; 
</p>
<p>(b) To take a statement or testimony from a witness or complete the collection 
and examination of evidence which had begun prior to the making of the 
challenge; and 
</p>
<p>(c) In cooperation with the relevant States, to prevent the absconding of persons 
in respect of whom the Prosecutor has already requested a warrant of arrest 
under article 58.
</p>
<p>9. The making of a challenge shall not affect the validity of any act performed by the 
Prosecutor or any order or warrant issued by the Court prior to the making of the 
challenge. </p>
<p />
</div>
<div class="page"><p />
<p>18
</p>
<p>Rome Statute of the International Criminal Court
</p>
<p>10. If the Court has decided that a case is inadmissible under article 17, the Prosecutor 
may submit a request for a review of the decision when he or she is fully satisfied that 
new facts have arisen which negate the basis on which the case had previously been 
found inadmissible under article 17. 
</p>
<p>11. If the Prosecutor, having regard to the matters referred to in article 17, defers an 
investigation, the Prosecutor may request that the relevant State make available to the 
Prosecutor information on the proceedings. That information shall, at the request of the 
State concerned, be confidential. If the Prosecutor thereafter decides to proceed with 
an investigation, he or she shall notify the State to which deferral of the proceedings 
has taken place. 
</p>
<p>Article 208
</p>
<p>Ne bis in idem
</p>
<p>1. Except as provided in this Statute, no person shall be tried before the Court with 
respect to conduct which formed the basis of crimes for which the person has been 
convicted or acquitted by the Court. 
</p>
<p>2. No person shall be tried by another court for a crime referred to in article 5 for which 
that person has already been convicted or acquitted by the Court. 
</p>
<p>3. No person who has been tried by another court for conduct also proscribed under 
article 6, 7, 8 or 8 bis shall be tried by the Court with respect to the same conduct unless 
the proceedings in the other court: 
</p>
<p>(a) Were for the purpose of shielding the person concerned from criminal 
responsibility for crimes within the jurisdiction of the Court; or 
</p>
<p>(b) Otherwise were not conducted independently or impartially in accordance 
with the norms of due process recognized by international law and were 
conducted in a manner which, in the circumstances, was inconsistent with an 
intent to bring the person concerned to justice.
</p>
<p>Article 21 
Applicable law
</p>
<p>1. The Court shall apply: 
</p>
<p>(a) In the first place, this Statute, Elements of Crimes and its Rules of Procedure 
and Evidence; 
</p>
<p>(b) In the second place, where appropriate, applicable treaties and the principles 
and rules of international law, including the established principles of the 
international law of armed conflict;

States that would normally exercise jurisdiction over the crime, provided that 
those principles are not inconsistent with this Statute and with international 
law and internationally recognized norms and standards.
</p>
<p>2. The Court may apply principles and rules of law as interpreted in its previous decisions. 
</p>
<p>3. The application and interpretation of law pursuant to this article must be consistent

</p>
<p>Rome Statute of the International Criminal Court
</p>
<p>(c) For the purpose of facilitating the commission of such a crime, aids, abets or 
otherwise assists in its commission or its attempted commission, including 
providing the means for its commission; 
</p>
<p>(d) In any other way contributes to the commission or attempted commission 
of such a crime by a group of persons acting with a common purpose. Such 
contribution shall be intentional and shall either: 
</p>
<p>(i) Be made with the aim of furthering the criminal activity or criminal

commission of a crime within the jurisdiction of the Court; or 
</p>
<p>(ii) Be made in the knowledge of the intention of the group to commit the 
crime;

commit genocide; 
</p>
<p>(f) Attempts to commit such a crime by taking action that commences its 
execution by means of a substantial step, but the crime does not occur because 
of circumstances independent of the personâs intentions. However, a person 
who abandons the effort to commit the crime or otherwise prevents the 
completion of the crime shall not be liable for punishment under this Statute 
for the attempt to commit that crime if that person completely and voluntarily

capacity. In particular, official capacity as a Head of State or Government, a member of 
a Government or parliament, an elected representative or a government official shall 
in no case exempt a person from criminal responsibility under this Statute, nor shall it, 
in and of itself, constitute a ground for reduction of sentence. 
</p>
<p>2. Immunities or special procedural rules which may attach to the official capacity of 
a person, whether under national or international law, shall not bar the Court from

<p>Rome Statute of the International Criminal Court
</p>

Responsibility of commanders and other superiors
</p>
<p>In addition to other grounds of criminal responsibility under this Statute for crimes within 
the jurisdiction of the Court: 
</p>
<p>1. A military commander or person effectively acting as a military commander shall 
be criminally responsible for crimes within the jurisdiction of the Court committed 
by forces under his or her effective command and control, or effective authority and 
control as the case may be, as a result of his or her failure to exercise control properly 
over such forces, where: 
</p>
<p>(a) That military commander or person either knew or, owing to the circumstances 
at the time, should have known that the forces were committing or about to 
commit such crimes; and 
</p>
<p>(b) That military commander or person failed to take all necessary and reasonable 
measures within his or her power to prevent or repress their commission 
or to submit the matter to the competent authorities for investigation and 
prosecution. 
</p>
<p>2. With respect to superior and subordinate relationships not described in paragraph (a), 
a superior shall be criminally responsible for crimes within the jurisdiction of the Court 
committed by subordinates under his or her effective authority and control, as a result 
of his or her failure to exercise control properly over such subordinates, where: 
</p>
<p>(a) The superior either knew, or consciously disregarded information which 
clearly indicated, that the subordinates were committing or about to commit 
such crimes; 
</p>
<p>(b) The crimes concerned activities that were within the effective responsibility 
and control of the superior; and 
</p>
<p>(c) The superior failed to take all necessary and reasonable measures within his 
or her power to prevent or repress their commission or to submit the matter to 
the competent authorities for investigation and prosecution.
</p>
<p>Article 29 
Non-applicability of statute of limitations

for punishment for a crime within the jurisdiction of the Court only if the material 
elements are committed with intent and knowledge. 
</p>
<p>2. For the purposes of this article, a person has intent where: 
</p>
<p>(a) In relation to conduct, that person means to engage in the conduct; 
</p>
<p>(b) In relation to a consequence, that person means to cause that consequence or 
is aware that it will occur in the ordinary course of events.</p>

</p>
<p>Rome Statute of the International Criminal Court
</p>
<p>3. For the purposes of this article, âknowledgeâ means awareness that a circumstance 
exists or a consequence will occur in the ordinary course of events. âKnowâ and 
âknowinglyâ shall be construed accordingly.
</p>
<p>Article 31 
Grounds for excluding criminal responsibility
</p>
<p>1. In addition to other grounds for excluding criminal responsibility provided for in this 
Statute, a person shall not be criminally responsible if, at the time of that personâs 
conduct: 
</p>
<p>(a) The person suffers from a mental disease or defect that destroys that personâs 
capacity to appreciate the unlawfulness or nature of his or her conduct, or 
capacity to control his or her conduct to conform to the requirements of law; 
</p>
<p>(b) The person is in a state of intoxication that destroys that personâs capacity 
to appreciate the unlawfulness or nature of his or her conduct, or capacity to 
control his or her conduct to conform to the requirements of law, unless the 
person has become voluntarily intoxicated under such circumstances that the 
person knew, or disregarded the risk, that, as a result of the intoxication, he or 
she was likely to engage in conduct constituting a crime within the jurisdiction 
of the Court; 
</p>
<p>(c) The person acts reasonably to defend himself or herself or another person or, 
in the case of war crimes, property which is essential for the survival of the 
person or another person or property which is essential for accomplishing a 
military mission, against an imminent and unlawful use of force in a manner 
proportionate to the degree of danger to the person or the other person or 
property protected. The fact that the person was involved in a defensive 
operation conducted by forces shall not in itself constitute a ground for 
excluding criminal responsibility under this subparagraph; 
</p>
<p>(d) The conduct which is alleged to constitute a crime within the jurisdiction of 
the Court has been caused by duress resulting from a threat of imminent 
death or of continuing or imminent serious bodily harm against that person or 
another person, and the person acts necessarily and reasonably to avoid this 
threat, provided that the person does not intend to cause a greater harm than 
the one sought to be avoided. Such a threat may either be: 
</p>
<p>(i) Made by other persons; or 
</p>
<p>(ii) Constituted by other circumstances beyond that personâs control.
</p>
<p>2. The Court shall determine the applicability of the grounds for excluding criminal 
responsibility provided for in this Statute to the case before it. 
</p>
<p>3. At trial, the Court may consider a ground for excluding criminal responsibility other 
than those referred to in paragraph 1 where such a ground is derived from applicable 
law as set forth in article 21. The procedures relating to the consideration of such a 
ground shall be provided for in the Rules of Procedure and Evidence. </p>
<p />

<div class="page"><p />
<p>24
</p>
<p>Rome Statute of the International Criminal Court
</p>
<p>Article 32 
Mistake of fact or mistake of law
</p>
<p>1. A mistake of fact shall be a ground for excluding criminal responsibility only if it 
negates the mental element required by the crime. 
</p>
<p>2. A mistake of law as to whether a particular type of conduct is a crime within the 
jurisdiction of the Court shall not be a ground for excluding criminal responsibility. 
A mistake of law may, however, be a ground for excluding criminal responsibility if it 
negates the mental element required by such a crime, or as provided for in article 33. 
</p>
<p>Article 33 
Superior orders and prescription of law
</p>
<p>1. The fact that a crime within the jurisdiction of the Court has been committed by a 
person pursuant to an order of a Government or of a superior, whether military or 
civilian, shall not relieve that person of criminal responsibility unless: 
</p>
<p>(a) The person was under a legal obligation to obey orders of the Government or 
the superior in question; 
</p>
<p>(b) The person did not know that the order was unlawful; and 
</p>
<p>(c) The order was not manifestly unlawful.
</p>
<p>2. For the purposes of this article, orders to commit genocide or crimes against humanity 
are manifestly unlawful. </p>

<p>PART 5.  
INVESTIGATION AND PROSECUTION
</p>
<p>Article 53 
Initiation of an investigation
</p>
<p>1. The Prosecutor shall, having evaluated the information made available to him or her, 
initiate an investigation unless he or she determines that there is no reasonable basis 
to proceed under this Statute. In deciding whether to initiate an investigation, the 
Prosecutor shall consider whether: 
</p>
<p>(a) The information available to the Prosecutor provides a reasonable basis to 
believe that a crime within the jurisdiction of the Court has been or is being 
committed; 
</p>
<p>(b) The case is or would be admissible under article 17; and 
</p>
<p>(c) Taking into account the gravity of the crime and the interests of victims, there 
are nonetheless substantial reasons to believe that an investigation would not 
serve the interests of justice.
</p>
<p>If the Prosecutor determines that there is no reasonable basis to proceed and his or 
her determination is based solely on subparagraph (c) above, he or she shall inform 
the Pre-Trial Chamber. 
</p>
<p>2. If, upon investigation, the Prosecutor concludes that there is not a sufficient basis for a 
prosecution because: 
</p>
<p>(a) There is not a sufficient legal or factual basis to seek a warrant or summons 
under article 58; 
</p>
<p>(b) The case is inadmissible under article 17; or 
</p>
<p>(c) A prosecution is not in the interests of justice, taking into account all the 
circumstances, including the gravity of the crime, the interests of victims and 
the age or infirmity of the alleged perpetrator, and his or her role in the alleged 
crime; the Prosecutor shall inform the Pre-Trial Chamber and the State making 
a referral under article 14 or the Security Council in a case under article 13, 
paragraph (b), of his or her conclusion and the reasons for the conclusion. 
</p>
<p>3. (a) At the request of the State making a referral under article 14 or the Security 
Council under article 13, paragraph (b), the Pre-Trial Chamber may review 
a decision of the Prosecutor under paragraph 1 or 2 not to proceed and may 
request the Prosecutor to reconsider that decision. 
</p>
<p>(b) In addition, the Pre-Trial Chamber may, on its own initiative, review a decision 
of the Prosecutor not to proceed if it is based solely on paragraph 1 (c) or 2 
(c). In such a case, the decision of the Prosecutor shall be effective only if 
confirmed by the Pre-Trial Chamber. 
</p>
<p>4. The Prosecutor may, at any time, reconsider a decision whether to initiate an 
investigation or prosecution based on new facts or information. </p>

deprived of his or her liberty except on such grounds and in accordance with 
such procedures as are established in this Statute.
</p>
<p>2. Where there are grounds to believe that a person has committed a crime within 
the jurisdiction of the Court and that person is about to be questioned either by the 
Prosecutor, or by national authorities pursuant to a request made under Part 9, that 
person shall also have the following rights of which he or she shall be informed prior 
to being questioned: 
</p>
<p>(a) To be informed, prior to being questioned, that there are grounds to believe 
that he or she has committed a crime within the jurisdiction of the Court; 
</p>
<p>(b) To remain silent, without such silence being a consideration in the 
determination of guilt or innocence; 
</p>
<p>(c) To have legal assistance of the personâs choosing, or, if the person does not 
have legal assistance, to have legal assistance assigned to him or her, in any 
case where the interests of justice so require, and without payment by the 
person in any such case if the person does not have sufficient means to pay for 
it; and 
</p>
<p>(d) To be questioned in the presence of counsel unless the person has voluntarily 
waived his or her right to counsel.
</p>
<p>Article 56 
Role of the Pre-Trial Chamber in relation to a unique investigative 
opportunity
</p>
<p>1. (a) Where the Prosecutor considers an investigation to present a unique 
opportunity to take testimony or a statement from a witness or to examine, 
collect or test evidence, which may not be available subsequently for the 
purposes of a trial, the Prosecutor shall so inform the Pre-Trial Chamber. 
</p>
<p>(b) In that case, the Pre-Trial Chamber may, upon request of the Prosecutor, take 
such measures as may be necessary to ensure the efficiency and integrity of 
the proceedings and, in particular, to protect the rights of the defence. 
</p>
<p>(c) Unless the Pre-Trial Chamber orders otherwise, the Prosecutor shall provide 
the relevant information to the person who has been arrested or appeared in 
response to a summons in connection with the investigation referred to in 
subparagraph (a), in order that he or she may be heard on the matter. 
</p>
<p>2. The measures referred to in paragraph 1 (b) may include: 
</p>
<p>(a) Making recommendations or orders regarding procedures to be followed; 
</p>
<p>(b) Directing that a record be made of the proceedings; 
</p>
<p>(c) Appointing an expert to assist; </p>

</p>
<p>(d) Authorizing counsel for a person who has been arrested, or appeared before 
the Court in response to a summons, to participate, or where there has not 
yet been such an arrest or appearance or counsel has not been designated, 
appointing another counsel to attend and represent the interests of the 
defence; 
</p>
<p>(e) Naming one of its members or, if necessary, another available judge of the

<p>(f) Taking such other action as may be necessary to collect or preserve evidence.
</p>
<p>3. (a) Where the Prosecutor has not sought measures pursuant to this article but 
the Pre-Trial Chamber considers that such measures are required to preserve 
evidence that it deems would be essential for the defence at trial, it shall consult 
with the Prosecutor as to whether there is good reason for the Prosecutorâs 
failure to request the measures. If upon consultation, the Pre-Trial Chamber 
concludes that the Prosecutorâs failure to request such measures is unjustified, 
the Pre-Trial Chamber may take such measures on its own initiative. 
</p>
<p>(b) A decision of the Pre-Trial Chamber to act on its own initiative under this 
paragraph may be appealed by the Prosecutor. The appeal shall be heard on 
an expedited basis.

<p>4. The admissibility of evidence preserved or collected for trial pursuant to this article, 
or the record thereof, shall be governed at trial by article 69, and given such weight as 
determined by the Trial Chamber.

<p>(b) In all other cases, a single judge of the Pre-Trial Chamber may exercise the 
functions provided for in this Statute, unless otherwise provided for in the 
Rules of Procedure and Evidence or by a majority of the Pre-Trial Chamber. 
</p>
<p>3. In addition to its other functions under this Statute, the Pre-Trial Chamber may:

required for the purposes of an investigation; 
</p>
<p>(b) Upon the request of a person who has been arrested or has appeared pursuant

those described in article 56, or seek such cooperation pursuant to Part 9 as 
may be necessary to assist the person in the preparation of his or her defence; </p>

<p>(d) Authorize the Prosecutor to take specific investigative steps within the 
territory of a State Party without having secured the cooperation of that State 
under Part 9 if, whenever possible having regard to the views of the State 
concerned, the Pre-Trial Chamber has determined in that case that the State 
is clearly unable to execute a request for cooperation due to the unavailability 
of any authority or any component of its judicial system competent to execute 
the request for cooperation under Part 9; 
</p>
<p>(e) Where a warrant of arrest or a summons has been issued under article 58, 
and having due regard to the strength of the evidence and the rights of the 
parties concerned, as provided for in this Statute and the Rules of Procedure 
and Evidence, seek the cooperation of States pursuant to article 93, paragraph 
1 (k), to take protective measures for the purpose of forfeiture, in particular for 
the ultimate benefit of victims.
</p>
<p>Article 58 
Issuance by the Pre-Trial Chamber of a warrant of arrest or a summons to 
appear
</p>
<p>1. At any time after the initiation of an investigation, the Pre-Trial Chamber shall, on the 
application of the Prosecutor, issue a warrant of arrest of a person if, having examined 
the application and the evidence or other information submitted by the Prosecutor, it 
is satisfied that: 
</p>
<p>(a) There are reasonable grounds to believe that the person has committed a 
crime within the jurisdiction of the Court; and 
</p>
<p>(b) The arrest of the person appears necessary: 
</p>
<p>(i) To ensure the personâs appearance at trial; 
</p>
<p>(ii) To ensure that the person does not obstruct or endanger the 
investigation or the court proceedings; or 
</p>
<p>(iii) Where applicable, to prevent the person from continuing with 
the commission of that crime or a related crime which is within 
the jurisdiction of the Court and which arises out of the same 
circumstances.
</p>
<p>2. The application of the Prosecutor shall contain: 
</p>
<p>(a) The name of the person and any other relevant identifying information; 
</p>
<p>(b) A specific reference to the crimes within the jurisdiction of the Court which 
the person is alleged to have committed; 
</p>
<p>(c) A concise statement of the facts which are alleged to constitute those crimes; 
</p>
<p>(d) A summary of the evidence and any other information which establish 
reasonable grounds to believe that the person committed those crimes; and </p>
<p />
</div>
<div class="page"><p />
<p>41
</p>
<p>Rome Statute of the International Criminal Court
</p>
<p>(e) The reason why the Prosecutor believes that the arrest of the person is 
necessary.
</p>
<p>3. The warrant of arrest shall contain: 
</p>
<p>(a) The name of the person and any other relevant identifying information; 
</p>
<p>(b) A specific reference to the crimes within the jurisdiction of the Court for which 
the personâs arrest is sought; and 
</p>
<p>(c) A concise statement of the facts which are alleged to constitute those crimes.
</p>
<p>4. The warrant of arrest shall remain in effect until otherwise ordered by the Court. 
</p>
<p>5. On the basis of the warrant of arrest, the Court may request the provisional arrest or 
the arrest and surrender of the person under Part 9. 
</p>
<p>6. The Prosecutor may request the Pre-Trial Chamber to amend the warrant of arrest by 
modifying or adding to the crimes specified therein. The Pre-Trial Chamber shall so 
amend the warrant if it is satisfied that there are reasonable grounds to believe that the 
person committed the modified or additional crimes. 
</p>
<p>7. As an alternative to seeking a warrant of arrest, the Prosecutor may submit an 
application requesting that the Pre-Trial Chamber issue a summons for the person 
to appear. If the Pre-Trial Chamber is satisfied that there are reasonable grounds to 
believe that the person committed the crime alleged and that a summons is sufficient 
to ensure the personâs appearance, it shall issue the summons, with or without 
conditions restricting liberty (other than detention) if provided for by national law, for 
the person to appear. The summons shall contain: 
</p>
<p>(a) The name of the person and any other relevant identifying information; 
</p>
<p>(b) The specified date on which the person is to appear; 
</p>
<p>(c) A specific reference to the crimes within the jurisdiction of the Court which 
the person is alleged to have committed; and

Arrest proceedings in the custodial State
</p>
<p>1. A State Party which has received a request for provisional arrest or for arrest and 
surrender shall immediately take steps to arrest the person in question in accordance 
with its laws and the provisions of Part 9. 
</p>
<p>2. A person arrested shall be brought promptly before the competent judicial authority 
in the custodial State which shall determine, in accordance with the law of that State, 
that: 
</p>
<p>(a) The warrant applies to that person; 
</p>
<p>(b) The person has been arrested in accordance with the proper process; and 
</p>
<p>(c) The personâs rights have been respected.</p>
<p />
</div>
<div class="page"><p />
<p>42
</p>
<p>Rome Statute of the International Criminal Court
</p>
<p>3. The person arrested shall have the right to apply to the competent authority in the 
custodial State for interim release pending surrender. 
</p>
<p>4. In reaching a decision on any such application, the competent authority in the 
custodial State shall consider whether, given the gravity of the alleged crimes, there are 
urgent and exceptional circumstances to justify interim release and whether necessary 
safeguards exist to ensure that the custodial State can fulfil its duty to surrender the 
person to the Court. It shall not be open to the competent authority of the custodial 
State to consider whether the warrant of arrest was properly issued in accordance with 
article 58, paragraph 1 (a) and (b). 
</p>
<p>5. The Pre-Trial Chamber shall be notified of any request for interim release and shall make 
recommendations to the competent authority in the custodial State. The competent 
authority in the custodial State shall give full consideration to such recommendations, 
including any recommendations on measures to prevent the escape of the person, 
before rendering its decision. 
</p>
<p>6. If the person is granted interim release, the Pre-Trial Chamber may request periodic 
reports on the status of the interim release. 
</p>
<p>7. Once ordered to be surrendered by the custodial State, the person shall be delivered to 
the Court as soon as possible. 
</p>
<p>Article 60 
Initial proceedings before the Court
</p>
<p>1. Upon the surrender of the person to the Court, or the personâs appearance before the 
Court voluntarily or pursuant to a summons, the Pre-Trial Chamber shall satisfy itself 
that the person has been informed of the crimes which he or she is alleged to have 
committed, and of his or her rights under this Statute, including the right to apply for 
interim release pending trial. 
</p>
<p>2. A person subject to a warrant of arrest may apply for interim release pending trial. If 
the Pre-Trial Chamber is satisfied that the conditions set forth in article 58, paragraph 
1, are met, the person shall continue to be detained. If it is not so satisfied, the Pre-
Trial Chamber shall release the person, with or without conditions. 
</p>
<p>3. The Pre-Trial Chamber shall periodically review its ruling on the release or detention of 
the person, and may do so at any time on the request of the Prosecutor or the person. 
Upon such review, it may modify its ruling as to detention, release or conditions of 
release, if it is satisfied that changed circumstances so require. 
</p>
<p>4. The Pre-Trial Chamber shall ensure that a person is not detained for an unreasonable 
period prior to trial due to inexcusable delay by the Prosecutor. If such delay occurs, 
the Court shall consider releasing the person, with or without conditions. 
</p>
<p>5. If necessary, the Pre-Trial Chamber may issue a warrant of arrest to secure the presence 
of a person who has been released. </p>

</p>
<p>Rome Statute of the International Criminal Court
</p>
<p>Article 61 
Confirmation of the charges before trial
</p>
<p>1. Subject to the provisions of paragraph 2, within a reasonable time after the personâs 
surrender or voluntary appearance before the Court, the Pre-Trial Chamber shall hold 
a hearing to confirm the charges on which the Prosecutor intends to seek trial. The 
hearing shall be held in the presence of the Prosecutor and the person charged, as well 
as his or her counsel. 
</p>
<p>2. The Pre-Trial Chamber may, upon request of the Prosecutor or on its own motion, 
hold a hearing in the absence of the person charged to confirm the charges on which 
the Prosecutor intends to seek trial when the person has: 
</p>
<p>(a) Waived his or her right to be present; or 
</p>
<p>(b) Fled or cannot be found and all reasonable steps have been taken to secure his 
or her appearance before the Court and to inform the person of the charges 
and that a hearing to confirm those charges will be held.
</p>
<p>In that case, the person shall be represented by counsel where the Pre-Trial Chamber 
determines that it is in the interests of justice. 
</p>
<p>3. Within a reasonable time before the hearing, the person shall: 
</p>
<p>(a) Be provided with a copy of the document containing the charges on which the 
Prosecutor intends to bring the person to trial; and 
</p>
<p>(b) Be informed of the evidence on which the Prosecutor intends to rely at the 
hearing.
</p>
<p>The Pre-Trial Chamber may issue orders regarding the disclosure of information for 
the purposes of the hearing. 
</p>
<p>4. Before the hearing, the Prosecutor may continue the investigation and may amend or 
withdraw any charges. The person shall be given reasonable notice before the hearing 
of any amendment to or withdrawal of charges. In case of a withdrawal of charges, the 
Prosecutor shall notify the Pre-Trial Chamber of the reasons for the withdrawal. 
</p>
<p>5. At the hearing, the Prosecutor shall support each charge with sufficient evidence to 
establish substantial grounds to believe that the person committed the crime charged. 
The Prosecutor may rely on documentary or summary evidence and need not call the 
witnesses expected to testify at the trial. 
</p>
<p>6. At the hearing, the person may: 
</p>
<p>(a) Object to the charges; 
</p>
<p>(b) Challenge the evidence presented by the Prosecutor; and 
</p>
<p>(c) Present evidence.
</p>
<p>7. The Pre-Trial Chamber shall, on the basis of the hearing, determine whether there 
is sufficient evidence to establish substantial grounds to believe that the person 
committed each of the crimes charged. Based on its determination, the Pre-Trial 
Chamber shall: </p>
<p />
</div>
<div class="page"><p />
<p>44
</p>
<p>Rome Statute of the International Criminal Court
</p>
<p>(a) Confirm those charges in relation to which it has determined that there is 
sufficient evidence, and commit the person to a Trial Chamber for trial on the 
charges as confirmed; 
</p>
<p>(b) Decline to confirm those charges in relation to which it has determined that 
there is insufficient evidence; 
</p>
<p>(c) Adjourn the hearing and request the Prosecutor to consider: 
</p>
<p>(i) Providing further evidence or conducting further investigation with 
respect to a particular charge; or 
</p>
<p>(ii) Amending a charge because the evidence submitted appears to 
establish a different crime within the jurisdiction of the Court.
</p>
<p>8. Where the Pre-Trial Chamber declines to confirm a charge, the Prosecutor shall not be 
precluded from subsequently requesting its confirmation if the request is supported by 
additional evidence. 
</p>
<p>9. After the charges are confirmed and before the trial has begun, the Prosecutor may, 
with the permission of the Pre-Trial Chamber and after notice to the accused, amend 
the charges. If the Prosecutor seeks to add additional charges or to substitute more 
serious charges, a hearing under this article to confirm those charges must be held. 
After commencement of the trial, the Prosecutor may, with the permission of the Trial 
Chamber, withdraw the charges. 
</p>
<p>10. Any warrant previously issued shall cease to have effect with respect to any charges 
which have not been confirmed by the Pre-Trial Chamber or which have been 
withdrawn by the Prosecutor. 
</p>
<p>11. Once the charges have been confirmed in accordance with this article, the Presidency 
shall constitute a Trial Chamber which, subject to paragraph 9 and to article 64, 
paragraph 4, shall be responsible for the conduct of subsequent proceedings and 
may exercise any function of the Pre-Trial Chamber that is relevant and capable of 
application in those proceedings. </p>

special circumstances require that certain proceedings be in closed session for the 
purposes set forth in article 68, or to protect confidential or sensitive information to be 
given in evidence. 
</p>
<p>8. (a) At the commencement of the trial, the Trial Chamber shall have read to the 
accused the charges previously confirmed by the Pre-Trial Chamber. The Trial 
Chamber shall satisfy itself that the accused understands the nature of the 
charges. It shall afford him or her the opportunity to make an admission of 
guilt in accordance with article 65 or to plead not guilty. 
</p>
<p>(b) At the trial, the presiding judge may give directions for the conduct of 
proceedings, including to ensure that they are conducted in a fair and

charges and which the accused accepts; and 
</p>
<p>(iii) Any other evidence, such as the testimony of witnesses, presented by 
the Prosecutor or the accused.
</p>
<p>2. Where the Trial Chamber is satisfied that the matters referred to in paragraph 1 are 
established, it shall consider the admission of guilt, together with any additional 
evidence presented, as establishing all the essential facts that are required to prove 
the crime to which the admission of guilt relates, and may convict the accused of that 
crime. 
</p>
<p>3. Where the Trial Chamber is not satisfied that the matters referred to in paragraph 1 
are established, it shall consider the admission of guilt as not having been made, in 
which case it shall order that the trial be continued under the ordinary trial procedures 
provided by this Statute and may remit the case to another Trial Chamber.

facts of the case is required in the interests of justice, in particular the interests of the 
victims, the Trial Chamber may: 
</p>
<p>(a) Request the Prosecutor to present additional evidence, including the testimony 
of witnesses; or 
</p>
<p>(b) Order that the trial be continued under the ordinary trial procedures provided 
by this Statute, in which case it shall consider the admission of guilt as not 
having been made and may remit the case to another Trial Chamber.

Statute; 
</p>
<p>(f) To have, free of any cost, the assistance of a competent interpreter and such 
translations as are necessary to meet the requirements of fairness, if any of 
the proceedings of or documents presented to the Court are not in a language 
which the accused fully understands and speaks; 
</p>
<p>(g) Not to be compelled to testify or to confess guilt and to remain silent, without 
such silence being a consideration in the determination of guilt or innocence;

<p>(h) To make an unsworn oral or written statement in his or her defence; and 
</p>
<p>(i) Not to have imposed on him or her any reversal of the burden of proof or any 
onus of rebuttal.

as soon as practicable, disclose to the defence evidence in the Prosecutorâs possession 
or control which he or she believes shows or tends to show the innocence of the 
accused, or to mitigate the guilt of the accused, or which may affect the credibility 
of prosecution evidence. In case of doubt as to the application of this paragraph, the 
Court shall decide. 
</p>
<p>Article 68 
Protection of the victims and witnesses and their participation in the 
proceedings
</p>
<p>1. The Court shall take appropriate measures to protect the safety, physical and 
psychological well-being, dignity and privacy of victims and witnesses. In so doing, the 
Court shall have regard to all relevant factors, including age, gender as defined in article 
7, paragraph 3, and health, and the nature of the crime, in particular, but not limited 
to, where the crime involves sexual or gender violence or violence against children. 
The Prosecutor shall take such measures particularly during the investigation and 
prosecution of such crimes. These measures shall not be prejudicial to or inconsistent 
with the rights of the accused and a fair and impartial trial. </p>

</p>
<p>Rome Statute of the International Criminal Court
</p>
<p>2. As an exception to the principle of public hearings provided for in article 67, the 
Chambers of the Court may, to protect victims and witnesses or an accused, conduct 
any part of the proceedings in camera or allow the presentation of evidence by 
electronic or other special means. In particular, such measures shall be implemented 
in the case of a victim of sexual violence or a child who is a victim or a witness, unless 
otherwise ordered by the Court, having regard to all the circumstances, particularly the 
views of the victim or witness. 
</p>
<p>3. Where the personal interests of the victims are affected, the Court shall permit their 
views and concerns to be presented and considered at stages of the proceedings 
determined to be appropriate by the Court and in a manner which is not prejudicial 
to or inconsistent with the rights of the accused and a fair and impartial trial. Such 
views and concerns may be presented by the legal representatives of the victims where 
the Court considers it appropriate, in accordance with the Rules of Procedure and 
Evidence. 
</p>
<p>4. The Victims and Witnesses Unit may advise the Prosecutor and the Court on 
appropriate protective measures, security arrangements, counselling and assistance as 
referred to in article 43, paragraph 6. 
</p>
<p>5. Where the disclosure of evidence or information pursuant to this Statute may lead to 
the grave endangerment of the security of a witness or his or her family, the Prosecutor 
may, for the purposes of any proceedings conducted prior to the commencement 
of the trial, withhold such evidence or information and instead submit a summary 
thereof. Such measures shall be exercised in a manner which is not prejudicial to or 
inconsistent with the rights of the accused and a fair and impartial trial. 
</p>
<p>6. A State may make an application for necessary measures to be taken in respect of 
the protection of its servants or agents and the protection of confidential or sensitive 
information.

<p>2. The testimony of a witness at trial shall be given in person, except to the extent provided 
by the measures set forth in article 68 or in the Rules of Procedure and Evidence. The 
Court may also permit the giving of viva voce (oral) or recorded testimony of a witness 
by means of video or audio technology, as well as the introduction of documents 
or written transcripts, subject to this Statute and in accordance with the Rules of 
Procedure and Evidence. These measures shall not be prejudicial to or inconsistent 
with the rights of the accused. 
</p>
<p>3. The parties may submit evidence relevant to the case, in accordance with article 64. 
The Court shall have the authority to request the submission of all evidence that it 
considers necessary for the determination of the truth. </p>

<p>50
</p>
<p>Rome Statute of the International Criminal Court
</p>
<p>4. The Court may rule on the relevance or admissibility of any evidence, taking into 
account, inter alia, the probative value of the evidence and any prejudice that such 
evidence may cause to a fair trial or to a fair evaluation of the testimony of a witness, 
in accordance with the Rules of Procedure and Evidence. 
</p>
<p>5. The Court shall respect and observe privileges on confidentiality as provided for in the 
Rules of Procedure and Evidence. 
</p>
<p>6. The Court shall not require proof of facts of common knowledge but may take judicial 
notice of them. 
</p>
<p>7. Evidence obtained by means of a violation of this Statute or internationally recognized 
human rights shall not be admissible if: 
</p>
<p>(a) The violation casts substantial doubt on the reliability of the evidence; or 
</p>
<p>(b) The admission of the evidence would be antithetical to and would seriously 
damage the integrity of the proceedings.

Court shall not rule on the application of the Stateâs national law.

</p>
<p>Article 71 
Sanctions for misconduct before the Court
</p>
<p>1. The Court may sanction persons present before it who commit misconduct, including 
disruption of its proceedings or deliberate refusal to comply with its directions, by 
administrative measures other than imprisonment, such as temporary or permanent 
removal from the courtroom, a fine or other similar measures provided for in the Rules 
of Procedure and Evidence. 
</p>
<p>2. The procedures governing the imposition of the measures set forth in paragraph 1 
shall be those provided for in the Rules of Procedure and Evidence.
</p>
<p>Article 72 
Protection of national security information
</p>
<p>1. This article applies in any case where the disclosure of the information or documents 
of a State would, in the opinion of that State, prejudice its national security interests. 
Such cases include those falling within the scope of article 56, paragraphs 2 and 3, 
article 61, paragraph 3, article 64, paragraph 3, article 67, paragraph 2, article 68, 
paragraph 6, article 87, paragraph 6 and article 93, as well as cases arising at any other 
stage of the proceedings where such disclosure may be at issue. 
</p>
<p>2. This article shall also apply when a person who has been requested to give information 
or evidence has refused to do so or has referred the matter to the State on the ground 
that disclosure would prejudice the national security interests of a State and the State 
concerned confirms that it is of the opinion that disclosure would prejudice its national 
security interests. 
</p>
<p>3. Nothing in this article shall prejudice the requirements of confidentiality applicable 
under article 54, paragraph 3 (e) and (f), or the application of article 73. 
</p>
<p>4. If a State learns that information or documents of the State are being, or are likely to be, 
disclosed at any stage of the proceedings, and it is of the opinion that disclosure would 
prejudice its national security interests, that State shall have the right to intervene in 
order to obtain resolution of the issue in accordance with this article. 
</p>
<p>5. If, in the opinion of a State, disclosure of information would prejudice its national 
security interests, all reasonable steps will be taken by the State, acting in conjunction 
with the Prosecutor, the defence or the Pre-Trial Chamber or Trial Chamber, as the 
case may be, to seek to resolve the matter by cooperative means. Such steps may 
include: 
</p>
<p>(a) Modification or clarification of the request; </p>
<p />
</div>
<div class="page"><p />
<p>52
</p>
<p>Rome Statute of the International Criminal Court
</p>
<p>(b) A determination by the Court regarding the relevance of the information 
or evidence sought, or a determination as to whether the evidence, though 
relevant, could be or has been obtained from a source other than the requested 
State; 
</p>
<p>(c) Obtaining the information or evidence from a different source or in a different 
form; or 
</p>
<p>(d) Agreement on conditions under which the assistance could be provided 
including, among other things, providing summaries or redactions, limitations 
on disclosure, use of in camera or ex parte proceedings, or other protective 
measures permissible under the Statute and the Rules of Procedure and 
Evidence.
</p>
<p>6. Once all reasonable steps have been taken to resolve the matter through cooperative 
means, and if the State considers that there are no means or conditions under which 
the information or documents could be provided or disclosed without prejudice to 
its national security interests, it shall so notify the Prosecutor or the Court of the 
specific reasons for its decision, unless a specific description of the reasons would itself 
necessarily result in such prejudice to the Stateâs national security interests.
</p>
<p>7. Thereafter, if the Court determines that the evidence is relevant and necessary for the 
establishment of the guilt or innocence of the accused, the Court may undertake the 
following actions: 
</p>
<p>(a) Where disclosure of the information or document is sought pursuant to 
a request for cooperation under Part 9 or the circumstances described in 
paragraph 2, and the State has invoked the ground for refusal referred to in 
article 93, paragraph 4: 
</p>
<p>(i) The Court may, before making any conclusion referred to in 
subparagraph 7 (a) (ii), request further consultations for the purpose 
of considering the Stateâs representations, which may include, as 
appropriate, hearings in camera and ex parte; 
</p>
<p>(ii) If the Court concludes that, by invoking the ground for refusal under 
article 93, paragraph 4, in the circumstances of the case, the requested 
State is not acting in accordance with its obligations under this 
Statute, the Court may refer the matter in accordance with article 87, 
paragraph 7, specifying the reasons for its conclusion; and 
</p>
<p>(iii) The Court may make such inference in the trial of the accused as to 
the existence or non-existence of a fact, as may be appropriate in the 
circumstances; or 
</p>
<p>(b) In all other circumstances: 
</p>
<p>(i) Order disclosure; or 
</p>
<p>(ii) To the extent it does not order disclosure, make such inference in the 
trial of the accused as to the existence or non-existence of a fact, as 
may be appropriate in the circumstances.</p>

<p>If a State Party is requested by the Court to provide a document or information in its custody, 
possession or control, which was disclosed to it in confidence by a State, intergovernmental 
organization or international organization, it shall seek the consent of the originator to 
disclose that document or information. If the originator is a State Party, it shall either 
consent to disclosure of the information or document or undertake to resolve the issue of 
disclosure with the Court, subject to the provisions of article 72. If the originator is not a 
State Party and refuses to consent to disclosure, the requested State shall inform the Court

contain the views of the majority and the minority. The decision or a summary thereof 
shall be delivered in open court.
</p>
<p>Article 75 
Reparations to victims
</p>
<p>1. The Court shall establish principles relating to reparations to, or in respect of, victims, 
including restitution, compensation and rehabilitation. On this basis, in its decision 
the Court may, either upon request or on its own motion in exceptional circumstances, 
determine the scope and extent of any damage, loss and injury to, or in respect of, 
victims and will state the principles on which it is acting. 
</p>
<p>2. The Court may make an order directly against a convicted person specifying appropriate 
reparations to, or in respect of, victims, including restitution, compensation and 
rehabilitation. Where appropriate, the Court may order that the award for reparations 
be made through the Trust Fund provided for in article 79.
</p>
<p>3. Before making an order under this article, the Court may invite and shall take account 
of representations from or on behalf of the convicted person, victims, other interested 
persons or interested States. </p>

a crime within the jurisdiction of the Court, determine whether, in order to give effect 
to an order which it may make under this article, it is necessary to seek measures under 
article 93, paragraph 1. 
</p>
<p>5. A State Party shall give effect to a decision under this article as if the provisions of 
article 109 were applicable to this article. 
</p>
<p>6. Nothing in this article shall be interpreted as prejudicing the rights of victims under 
national or international law. 
</p>
<p>Article 76

<p>1. In the event of a conviction, the Trial Chamber shall consider the appropriate sentence 
to be imposed and shall take into account the evidence presented and submissions 
made during the trial that are relevant to the sentence.

may on its own motion and shall, at the request of the Prosecutor or the accused, 
hold a further hearing to hear any additional evidence or submissions relevant to the 
sentence, in accordance with the Rules of Procedure and Evidence. 
</p>

disproportion between the crime and the sentence; 
</p>

on which the conviction might be set aside, wholly or in part, it may invite 
the Prosecutor and the convicted person to submit grounds under article 81, 
paragraph 1 (a) or (b), and may render a decision on conviction in accordance 
with article 83; 
</p>
<p>(c) The same procedure applies when the Court, on an appeal against conviction 
only, considers that there are grounds to reduce the sentence under paragraph 
2 (a). 
</p>
<p>3. (a) Unless the Trial Chamber orders otherwise, a convicted person shall remain in 
custody pending an appeal; 
</p>
<p>(b) When a convicted personâs time in custody exceeds the sentence of

</div>
<div class="page"><p />
<p>58
</p>
<p>Rome Statute of the International Criminal Court
</p>
<p>(c) In case of an acquittal, the accused shall be released immediately, subject to 
the following: 
</p>
<p>(i) Under exceptional circumstances, and having regard, inter alia, to the

</p>
<p>(ii) A decision by the Trial Chamber under subparagraph (c) (i) may be

Appeal against other decisions
</p>
<p>1. Either party may appeal any of the following decisions in accordance with the Rules of 
Procedure and Evidence: 
</p>
<p>(a) A decision with respect to jurisdiction or admissibility; 
</p>
<p>(b) A decision granting or denying release of the person being investigated or 
prosecuted; 
</p>
<p>(c) A decision of the Pre-Trial Chamber to act on its own initiative under article 56, 
paragraph 3; 
</p>
<p>(d) A decision that involves an issue that would significantly affect the fair and

resolution by the Appeals Chamber may materially advance the proceedings.
</p>

against by the State concerned or by the Prosecutor, with the leave of the Pre-Trial 
Chamber. The appeal shall be heard on an expedited basis.

property adversely affected by an order under article 75 may appeal against the order

</p>
<p>Article 83 
Proceedings on appeal
</p>
<p>1. For the purposes of proceedings under article 81 and this article, the Appeals Chamber 
shall have all the powers of the Trial Chamber. 
</p>
<p>2. If the Appeals Chamber finds that the proceedings appealed from were unfair in a way 
that affected the reliability of the decision or sentence, or that the decision or sentence 
appealed from was materially affected by error of fact or law or procedural error, it 
may: </p>
<p />
</div>
<div class="page"><p />
<p>59
</p>
<p>Rome Statute of the International Criminal Court
</p>
<p>(a) Reverse or amend the decision or sentence; or 
</p>
<p>(b) Order a new trial before a different Trial Chamber.
</p>
<p>For these purposes, the Appeals Chamber may remand a factual issue to the original 
Trial Chamber for it to determine the issue and to report back accordingly, or may 
itself call evidence to determine the issue. When the decision or sentence has been 
appealed only by the person convicted, or the Prosecutor on that personâs behalf, it 
cannot be amended to his or her detriment. 
</p>
<p>3. If in an appeal against sentence the Appeals Chamber finds that the sentence is 
disproportionate to the crime, it may vary the sentence in accordance with Part 7. 
</p>
<p>4. The judgement of the Appeals Chamber shall be taken by a majority of the judges 
and shall be delivered in open court. The judgement shall state the reasons on which 
it is based. When there is no unanimity, the judgement of the Appeals Chamber shall 
contain the views of the majority and the minority, but a judge may deliver a separate 
or dissenting opinion on a question of law. 
</p>
<p>5. The Appeals Chamber may deliver its judgement in the absence of the person acquitted 
or convicted.
</p>
<p>Article 84 
Revision of conviction or sentence
</p>
<p>1. The convicted person or, after death, spouses, children, parents or one person alive at 
the time of the accusedâs death who has been given express written instructions from 
the accused to bring such a claim, or the Prosecutor on the personâs behalf, may apply 
to the Appeals Chamber to revise the final judgement of conviction or sentence on the 
grounds that: 
</p>
<p>(a) New evidence has been discovered that: 
</p>
<p>(i) Was not available at the time of trial, and such unavailability was not 
wholly or partially attributable to the party making application; and 
</p>
<p>(ii) Is sufficiently important that had it been proved at trial it would have 
been likely to have resulted in a different verdict;
</p>
<p>(b) It has been newly discovered that decisive evidence, taken into account at trial 
and upon which the conviction depends, was false, forged or falsified; 
</p>
<p>(c) One or more of the judges who participated in conviction or confirmation 
of the charges has committed, in that case, an act of serious misconduct or 
serious breach of duty of sufficient gravity to justify the removal of that judge 
or those judges from office under article 46.</p>
<p />
</div>
<div class="page"><p />
<p>60
</p>
<p>Rome Statute of the International Criminal Court
</p>
<p>2. The Appeals Chamber shall reject the application if it considers it to be unfounded. If 
it determines that the application is meritorious, it may, as appropriate: 
</p>
<p>(a) Reconvene the original Trial Chamber; 
</p>
<p>(b) Constitute a new Trial Chamber; or 
</p>
<p>(c) Retain jurisdiction over the matter,
</p>
<p>with a view to, after hearing the parties in the manner set forth in the Rules of 
Procedure and Evidence, arriving at a determination on whether the judgement 
should be revised. 
</p>
<p>Article 85 
Compensation to an arrested or convicted person
</p>
<p>1. Anyone who has been the victim of unlawful arrest or detention shall have an 
enforceable right to compensation. 
</p>
<p>2. When a person has by a final decision been convicted of a criminal offence, and 
when subsequently his or her conviction has been reversed on the ground that a 
new or newly discovered fact shows conclusively that there has been a miscarriage of 
justice, the person who has suffered punishment as a result of such conviction shall 
be compensated according to law, unless it is proved that the non-disclosure of the 
unknown fact in time is wholly or partly attributable to him or her. 
</p>
<p>3. In exceptional circumstances, where the Court finds conclusive facts showing that 
there has been a grave and manifest miscarriage of justice, it may in its discretion 
award compensation, according to the criteria provided in the Rules of Procedure and 
Evidence, to a person who has been released from detention following a final decision 
of acquittal or a termination of the proceedings for that reason. </p>

<p>PART 9. 
INTERNATIONAL COOPERATION AND JUDICIAL ASSISTANCE
</p>
<p>Article 86 
General obligation to cooperate
</p>
<p>States Parties shall, in accordance with the provisions of this Statute, cooperate fully with 
the Court in its investigation and prosecution of crimes within the jurisdiction of the Court.
</p>
<p>Article 87 
Requests for cooperation: general provisions
</p>
<p>1. (a) The Court shall have the authority to make requests to States Parties for 
cooperation. The requests shall be transmitted through the diplomatic channel 
or any other appropriate channel as may be designated by each State Party 
upon ratification, acceptance, approval or accession. 
</p>
<p> Subsequent changes to the designation shall be made by each State Party in 
accordance with the Rules of Procedure and Evidence. 
</p>
<p>(b) When appropriate, without prejudice to the provisions of subparagraph (a), 
requests may also be transmitted through the International Criminal Police 
Organization or any appropriate regional organization. 
</p>
<p>2. Requests for cooperation and any documents supporting the request shall either be in 
or be accompanied by a translation into an official language of the requested State or 
one of the working languages of the Court, in accordance with the choice made by that 
State upon ratification, acceptance, approval or accession. 
</p>
<p>Subsequent changes to this choice shall be made in accordance with the Rules of 
Procedure and Evidence. 
</p>
<p>3. The requested State shall keep confidential a request for cooperation and any 
documents supporting the request, except to the extent that the disclosure is necessary 
for execution of the request. 
</p>
<p>4. In relation to any request for assistance presented under this Part, the Court may take 
such measures, including measures related to the protection of information, as may be 
necessary to ensure the safety or physical or psychological well-being of any victims, 
potential witnesses and their families. The Court may request that any information 
that is made available under this Part shall be provided and handled in a manner that 
protects the safety and physical or psychological well-being of any victims, potential 
witnesses and their families. 
</p>
<p>5. The Court may invite any State not party to this Statute to provide assistance under 
this Part on the basis of an ad hoc arrangement, an agreement with such State or any 
other appropriate basis. 
</p>
<p>Where a State not party to this Statute, which has entered into an ad hoc arrangement 
or an agreement with the Court, fails to cooperate with requests pursuant to any 
such arrangement or agreement, the Court may so inform the Assembly of States 
Parties or, where the Security Council referred the matter to the Court, the Security 
Council. </p>
<p />
</div>
<div class="page"><p />
<p>62
</p>
<p>Rome Statute of the International Criminal Court
</p>
<p>6. The Court may ask any intergovernmental organization to provide information or 
documents. The Court may also ask for other forms of cooperation and assistance 
which may be agreed upon with such an organization and which are in accordance 
with its competence or mandate. 
</p>
<p>7. Where a State Party fails to comply with a request to cooperate by the Court contrary 
to the provisions of this Statute, thereby preventing the Court from exercising its 
functions and powers under this Statute, the Court may make a finding to that effect 
and refer the matter to the Assembly of States Parties or, where the Security Council 
referred the matter to the Court, to the Security Council. 
</p>
<p>Article 88 
Availability of procedures under national law
</p>
<p>States Parties shall ensure that there are procedures available under their national law for all 
of the forms of cooperation which are specified under this Part.
</p>
<p>Article 89 
Surrender of persons to the Court
</p>
<p>1. The Court may transmit a request for the arrest and surrender of a person, together 
with the material supporting the request outlined in article 91, to any State on the 
territory of which that person may be found and shall request the cooperation of that 
State in the arrest and surrender of such a person. States Parties shall, in accordance 
with the provisions of this Part and the procedure under their national law, comply 
with requests for arrest and surrender. 
</p>
<p>2. Where the person sought for surrender brings a challenge before a national court on 
the basis of the principle of ne bis in idem as provided in article 20, the requested State 
shall immediately consult with the Court to determine if there has been a relevant 
ruling on admissibility. If the case is admissible, the requested State shall proceed with 
the execution of the request. If an admissibility ruling is pending, the requested State 
may postpone the execution of the request for surrender of the person until the Court 
makes a determination on admissibility. 
</p>
<p>3. (a) A State Party shall authorize, in accordance with its national procedural law, 
transportation through its territory of a person being surrendered to the Court 
by another State, except where transit through that State would impede or 
delay the surrender. 
</p>
<p>(b) A request by the Court for transit shall be transmitted in accordance with 
article 87. The request for transit shall contain: 
</p>
<p>(i) A description of the person being transported;
</p>
<p>(ii) A brief statement of the facts of the case and their legal characterization; 
and
</p>
<p>(iii) The warrant for arrest and surrender;
</p>
<p>(c) A person being transported shall be detained in custody during the period of 
transit; </p>
<p />
</div>
<div class="page"><p />
<p>63
</p>
<p>Rome Statute of the International Criminal Court
</p>
<p>(d) No authorization is required if the person is transported by air and no landing 
is scheduled on the territory of the transit State; 
</p>
<p>(e) If an unscheduled landing occurs on the territory of the transit State, that 
State may require a request for transit from the Court as provided for in 
subparagraph (b). The transit State shall detain the person being transported 
until the request for transit is received and the transit is effected, provided that 
detention for purposes of this subparagraph may not be extended beyond 96 
hours from the unscheduled landing unless the request is received within that 
time. 
</p>
<p>4. If the person sought is being proceeded against or is serving a sentence in the requested 
State for a crime different from that for which surrender to the Court is sought, the 
requested State, after making its decision to grant the request, shall consult with the 
Court. 
</p>
<p>Article 90 
Competing requests
</p>
<p>1. A State Party which receives a request from the Court for the surrender of a person 
under article 89 shall, if it also receives a request from any other State for the extradition 
of the same person for the same conduct which forms the basis of the crime for which 
the Court seeks the personâs surrender, notify the Court and the requesting State of 
that fact. 
</p>
<p>2. Where the requesting State is a State Party, the requested State shall give priority to 
the request from the Court if: 
</p>
<p>(a) The Court has, pursuant to article 18 or 19, made a determination that the case 
in respect of which surrender is sought is admissible and that determination 
takes into account the investigation or prosecution conducted by the 
requesting State in respect of its request for extradition; or 
</p>
<p>(b) The Court makes the determination described in subparagraph (a) pursuant to 
the requested Stateâs notification under paragraph 1.
</p>
<p>3. Where a determination under paragraph 2 (a) has not been made, the requested State 
may, at its discretion, pending the determination of the Court under paragraph 2 (b), 
proceed to deal with the request for extradition from the requesting State but shall not 
extradite the person until the Court has determined that the case is inadmissible. The 
Courtâs determination shall be made on an expedited basis. 
</p>
<p>4. If the requesting State is a State not Party to this Statute the requested State, if it is not 
under an international obligation to extradite the person to the requesting State, shall 
give priority to the request for surrender from the Court, if the Court has determined 
that the case is admissible. 
</p>
<p>5. Where a case under paragraph 4 has not been determined to be admissible by the 
Court, the requested State may, at its discretion, proceed to deal with the request for 
extradition from the requesting State. </p>
<p />
</div>
<div class="page"><p />
<p>64
</p>
<p>Rome Statute of the International Criminal Court
</p>
<p>6. In cases where paragraph 4 applies except that the requested State is under an existing 
international obligation to extradite the person to the requesting State not Party to 
this Statute, the requested State shall determine whether to surrender the person to 
the Court or extradite the person to the requesting State. In making its decision, the 
requested State shall consider all the relevant factors, including but not limited to: 
</p>
<p>(a) The respective dates of the requests; 
</p>
<p>(b) The interests of the requesting State including, where relevant, whether the 
crime was committed in its territory and the nationality of the victims and of 
the person sought; and 
</p>
<p>(c) The possibility of subsequent surrender between the Court and the requesting 
State.
</p>
<p>7. Where a State Party which receives a request from the Court for the surrender of a 
person also receives a request from any State for the extradition of the same person 
for conduct other than that which constitutes the crime for which the Court seeks the 
personâs surrender: 
</p>
<p>(a) The requested State shall, if it is not under an existing international obligation 
to extradite the person to the requesting State, give priority to the request from 
the Court; 
</p>
<p>(b) The requested State shall, if it is under an existing international obligation to 
extradite the person to the requesting State, determine whether to surrender 
the person to the Court or to extradite the person to the requesting State. In 
making its decision, the requested State shall consider all the relevant factors, 
including but not limited to those set out in paragraph 6, but shall give special 
consideration to the relative nature and gravity of the conduct in question.
</p>
<p>8. Where pursuant to a notification under this article, the Court has determined a case 
to be inadmissible, and subsequently extradition to the requesting State is refused, the 
requested State shall notify the Court of this decision. 
</p>
<p>Article 91 
Contents of request for arrest and surrender

paragraph 1 (a). 
</p>
<p>2. In the case of a request for the arrest and surrender of a person for whom a warrant

<p>Rome Statute of the International Criminal Court
</p>
<p>(c) Such documents, statements or information as may be necessary to meet the 
requirements for the surrender process in the requested State, except that 
those requirements should not be more burdensome than those applicable 
to requests for extradition pursuant to treaties or arrangements between the 
requested State and other States and should, if possible, be less burdensome, 
taking into account the distinct nature of the Court.
</p>
<p>3. In the case of a request for the arrest and surrender of a person already convicted, the 
request shall contain or be supported by: 
</p>
<p>(a) A copy of any warrant of arrest for that person;

against the person sought; and 
</p>
<p>(d) A statement that a request for surrender of the person sought will follow.
</p>
<p>3. A person who is provisionally arrested may be released from custody if the requested 
State has not received the request for surrender and the documents supporting 
the request as specified in article 91 within the time limits specified in the Rules of 
Procedure and Evidence. However, the person may consent to surrender before the 
expiration of this period if permitted by the law of the requested State. In such a case, 
the requested State shall proceed to surrender the person to the Court as soon as 
possible. </p>
<p />
</div>
<div class="page"><p />
<p>66
</p>
<p>Rome Statute of the International Criminal Court
</p>
<p>4. The fact that the person sought has been released from custody pursuant to paragraph 3 
shall not prejudice the subsequent arrest and surrender of that person if the request for 
surrender and the documents supporting the request are delivered at a later date.
</p>
<p>Article 93 
Other forms of cooperation

</p>
<p>3. Where execution of a particular measure of assistance detailed in a request presented 
under paragraph 1, is prohibited in the requested State on the basis of an existing 
fundamental legal principle of general application, the requested State shall promptly 
consult with the Court to try to resolve the matter. In the consultations, consideration 
should be given to whether the assistance can be rendered in another manner or 
subject to conditions. If after consultations the matter cannot be resolved, the Court 
shall modify the request as necessary. </p>
<p />
</div>

<p>67
</p>
<p>Rome Statute of the International Criminal Court
</p>
<p>4. In accordance with article 72, a State Party may deny a request for assistance, in whole 
or in part, only if the request concerns the production of any documents or disclosure 
of evidence which relates to its national security. 
</p>
<p>5. Before denying a request for assistance under paragraph 1 (l), the requested State 
shall consider whether the assistance can be provided subject to specified conditions, 
or whether the assistance can be provided at a later date or in an alternative manner, 
provided that if the Court or the Prosecutor accepts the assistance subject to conditions, 
the Court or the Prosecutor shall abide by them. 
</p>
<p>6. If a request for assistance is denied, the requested State Party shall promptly inform 
the Court or the Prosecutor of the reasons for such denial. 
</p>

except as required for the investigation and proceedings described in the

<p>(b) The requested State may, when necessary, transmit documents or information 
to the Prosecutor on a confidential basis. The Prosecutor may then use them 
solely for the purpose of generating new evidence. 
</p>
<p>(c) The requested State may, on its own motion or at the request of the Prosecutor, 
subsequently consent to the disclosure of such documents or information. 
They may then be used as evidence pursuant to the provisions of Parts 5 and 
6 and in accordance with the Rules of Procedure and Evidence. 
</p>
<p>9. (a) (i) In the event that a State Party receives competing requests, other 
than for surrender or extradition, from the Court and from another 
State pursuant to an international obligation, the State Party shall 
endeavour, in consultation with the Court and the other State, to meet 
both requests, if necessary by postponing or attaching conditions to 
one or the other request. 
</p>
<p>(ii) Failing that, competing requests shall be resolved in accordance with 
the principles established in article 90. 
</p>
<p>(b) Where, however, the request from the Court concerns information, property

organization by virtue of an international agreement, the requested States 
shall so inform the Court and the Court shall direct its request to the third 
State or international organization. </p>

<p>Rome Statute of the International Criminal Court
</p>
<p>10. (a) The Court may, upon request, cooperate with and provide assistance to a State 
Party conducting an investigation into or trial in respect of conduct which

Postponement of execution of a request in respect of ongoing investigation or 
prosecution
</p>
<p>1. If the immediate execution of a request would interfere with an ongoing investigation 
or prosecution of a case different from that to which the request relates, the requested 
State may postpone the execution of the request for a period of time agreed upon 
with the Court. However, the postponement shall be no longer than is necessary 
to complete the relevant investigation or prosecution in the requested State. Before 
making a decision to postpone, the requested State should consider whether the 
assistance may be immediately provided subject to certain conditions. 
</p>
<p>2. If a decision to postpone is taken pursuant to paragraph 1, the Prosecutor may, 
however, seek measures to preserve evidence, pursuant to article 93, paragraph 1 (j).

<p>Rome Statute of the International Criminal Court
</p>
<p>Article 98 
Cooperation with respect to waiver of immunity and consent to surrender
</p>
<p>1. The Court may not proceed with a request for surrender or assistance which would 
require the requested State to act inconsistently with its obligations under international 
law with respect to the State or diplomatic immunity of a person or property of a 
third State, unless the Court can first obtain the cooperation of that third State for the 
waiver of the immunity. 
</p>
<p>2. The Court may not proceed with a request for surrender which would require 
the requested State to act inconsistently with its obligations under international 
agreements pursuant to which the consent of a sending State is required to surrender 
a person of that State to the Court, unless the Court can first obtain the cooperation of 
the sending State for the giving of consent for the surrender. 
</p>
<p>Article 99 
Execution of requests under articles 93 and 96
</p>
<p>1. Requests for assistance shall be executed in accordance with the relevant procedure

execution of a request which can be executed without any compulsory measures, 
including specifically the interview of or taking evidence from a person on a voluntary 
basis, including doing so without the presence of the authorities of the requested State 
Party if it is essential for the request to be executed, and the examination without 
modification of a public site or other public place, the Prosecutor may execute such 
request directly on the territory of a State as follows: 
</p>
<p>(a) When the State Party requested is a State on the territory of which the crime 
is alleged to have been committed, and there has been a determination of 
admissibility pursuant to article 18 or 19, the Prosecutor may directly execute 
such request following all possible consultations with the requested State 
Party; 
</p>
<p>(b) In other cases, the Prosecutor may execute such request following consultations 
with the requested State Party and subject to any reasonable conditions or 
concerns raised by that State Party. Where the requested State Party identifies 
problems with the execution of a request pursuant to this subparagraph it 
shall, without delay, consult with the Court to resolve the matter.
</p>
<p>5. Provisions allowing a person heard or examined by the Court under article 72 to invoke 
restrictions designed to prevent disclosure of confidential information connected with

</p>
<p>Article 103 
Role of States in enforcement of sentences of imprisonment
</p>
<p>1. (a) A sentence of imprisonment shall be served in a State designated by the Court 
from a list of States which have indicated to the Court their willingness to 
accept sentenced persons. 
</p>
<p>(b) At the time of declaring its willingness to accept sentenced persons, a State may 
attach conditions to its acceptance as agreed by the Court and in accordance 
with this Part. 
</p>
<p>(c) A State designated in a particular case shall promptly inform the Court 
whether it accepts the Courtâs designation. 
</p>
<p>2. (a) The State of enforcement shall notify the Court of any circumstances, including 
the exercise of any conditions agreed under paragraph 1, which could 
materially affect the terms or extent of the imprisonment. The Court shall be 
given at least 45 daysâ notice of any such known or foreseeable circumstances. 
During this period, the State of enforcement shall take no action that might 
prejudice its obligations under article 110. 
</p>
<p>(b) Where the Court cannot agree to the circumstances referred to in 
subparagraph (a), it shall notify the State of enforcement and proceed in 
accordance with article 104, paragraph 1. 
</p>
<p>3. In exercising its discretion to make a designation under paragraph 1, the Court shall 
take into account the following: 
</p>
<p>(a) The principle that States Parties should share the responsibility for enforcing 
sentences of imprisonment, in accordance with principles of equitable 
distribution, as provided in the Rules of Procedure and Evidence; 
</p>
<p>(b) The application of widely accepted international treaty standards governing 
the treatment of prisoners; 
</p>
<p>(c) The views of the sentenced person; 
</p>
<p>(d) The nationality of the sentenced person; 
</p>
<p>(e) Such other factors regarding the circumstances of the crime or the person 
sentenced, or the effective enforcement of the sentence, as may be appropriate 
in designating the State of enforcement. 
</p>
<p>4. If no State is designated under paragraph 1, the sentence of imprisonment shall be 
served in a prison facility made available by the host State, in accordance with the 
conditions set out in the headquarters agreement referred to in article 3, paragraph 2. 
In such a case, the costs arising out of the enforcement of a sentence of imprisonment 
shall be borne by the Court. </p>

governing treatment of prisoners. 
</p>
<p>2. The conditions of imprisonment shall be governed by the law of the State of enforcement

those available to prisoners convicted of similar offences in the State of enforcement. 
</p>
<p>3. Communications between a sentenced person and the Court shall be unimpeded and 
confidential.
</p>
<p>Article 107 
Transfer of the person upon completion of sentence
</p>
<p>1. Following completion of the sentence, a person who is not a national of the State 
of enforcement may, in accordance with the law of the State of enforcement, be 
transferred to a State which is obliged to receive him or her, or to another State 
which agrees to receive him or her, taking into account any wishes of the person to 
be transferred to that State, unless the State of enforcement authorizes the person to 
remain in its territory. 
</p>
<p>2. If no State bears the costs arising out of transferring the person to another State 
pursuant to paragraph 1, such costs shall be borne by the Court. 
</p>

<p>Article 108 
Limitation on the prosecution or punishment of other offences
</p>
<p>1. A sentenced person in the custody of the State of enforcement shall not be subject to 
prosecution or punishment or to extradition to a third State for any conduct engaged 
in prior to that personâs delivery to the State of enforcement, unless such prosecution,

of enforcement. 
</p>
<p>2. The Court shall decide the matter after having heard the views of the sentenced 
person. 
</p>

Review by the Court concerning reduction of sentence
</p>
<p>1. The State of enforcement shall not release the person before expiry of the sentence 
pronounced by the Court. 
</p>
<p>2. The Court alone shall have the right to decide any reduction of sentence, and shall rule 
on the matter after having heard the person. 
</p>
<p>3. When the person has served two thirds of the sentence, or 25 years in the case of life 
imprisonment, the Court shall review the sentence to determine whether it should be 
reduced. Such a review shall not be conducted before that time. 
</p>
<p>4. In its review under paragraph 3, the Court may reduce the sentence if it finds that one 
or more of the following factors are present: 
</p>
<p>(a) The early and continuing willingness of the person to cooperate with the 
Court in its investigations and prosecutions; 
</p>
<p>(b) The voluntary assistance of the person in enabling the enforcement of the 
judgements and orders of the Court in other cases, and in particular providing 
assistance in locating assets subject to orders of fine, forfeiture or reparation 
which may be used for the benefit of victims; or </p>

</p>
<p>(c) Other factors establishing a clear and significant change of circumstances 
sufficient to justify the reduction of sentence, as provided in the Rules of 
Procedure and Evidence.
</p>

to reduce the sentence, it shall thereafter review the question of reduction of sentence 
at such intervals and applying such criteria as provided for in the Rules of Procedure 
and Evidence. 
</p>
<p>Article 111 
Escape
</p>

may, after consultation with the Court, request the personâs surrender from the State in 
which the person is located pursuant to existing bilateral or multilateral arrangements, or 
may request that the Court seek the personâs surrender, in accordance with Part 9. It may 
direct that the person be delivered to the State in which he or she was serving the sentence 
or to another State designated by the Court. </p>
