<T><B>The parties to a contract may vary the provisions of the Uniform Commercial
Code (UCC)
by agreement </B> and may provide for remedies in addition to or in substitution for
those
provided by the UCC. Colorado Interstate Gas Co. v. Chemco,
Inc.,
854 P.2d 1232 (Colo. 1993).</T><P></P>
<T><B>Evidence of current commercial practices and customs</B> are considered
when
interpreting the UCC. The practice and custom of this state's real estate closings is that an
original note is not presented at the closing. Citywide Banks v. Armijo, 313 P.3d 647
(Colo. App. 2011).</T><P></P>
<T><B>Section 90(1) of the restatement (second) of contracts adopted,</B> which
articulates the doctrine of promissory estoppel. Kiely v. St. Germain, 670 P.2d 764

<T><B>The UCC does not exclude the application of promissory estoppel.</B>

<T>Recovery will be allowed on a theory of promissory estoppel, notwithstanding a
statute
of frauds defense, if injustice can be avoided only by enforcement of the promise.
Germain

grounds, 670 P.2d 764 (Colo. 1983).</T><P></P>
<T><B>Elements of promissory estoppel</B> are: (1) A promise which the promisor
should
reasonably expect to induce action or forbearance of a definite and substantial character
on
the part of the promisee; and (2) which does induce such action or forbearance; and (3) if
injustice can be avoided only by enforcement of the promise. Germain v. Boshouwers,
646

<T><B>The doctrine of estoppel was properly applied</B> in a case arising under the
secured transaction provisions of the code. First Nat'l Bank v. Ulibarri, 38 Colo. App.
428,
557 P.2d 1221 (1976).</T><P></P>
<T><B>Detrimental reliance upon oral promises.</B> The principle embodied in
section
139 of the restatement (second) of contracts that detrimental action performed in
justifiable
reliance upon oral promises may be sufficient to compel full or partial performance of the
promise in spite of the applicability of a statute of frauds defense was applicable in a case
involving an oral agreement to sell securities. Kiely v. St. Germain, 670 P.2d 764 (Colo.

612
P.2d 70 (1980).</T><P></P>
<T><B>Common-law claim for money had and received is still viable</B> since the
uniform commercial code contains no provision dealing with such a claim. Nat'l Sur.

<T>(35)<M>"Security interest" means an interest in personal property or fixtures that
secures payment or performance of an obligation. The term also includes any interest of a
consignor and a buyer of accounts, chattel paper, a payment intangible, or a promissory note
in a transaction that is subject to article 9 of this title. The special property interest of a
buyer of goods on identification of those goods to a contract for sale under section 4-2-401
is not a "security interest", but a buyer may also acquire a "security interest" by complying
with article 9 of this title. Except as otherwise provided in section 4-2-505, the right of a
seller or lessor of goods under article 2 or 2.5 of this title to retain or acquire possession of
the goods is not a "security interest", but a seller or lessor may also acquire a "security
interest" by complying with article 9 of this title. The retention or reservation of title by a
seller of goods notwithstanding shipment or delivery to the buyer (section 4-2-401) is
limited in effect to a reservation of a "security interest". Whether a transaction in the form
of a lease creates a "security interest" is determined pursuant to section 4-1-203.</M></T><P N="(b)(36)"></P>

An obligation may be issued as subordinated to performance
of another obligation of the person obligated, or a creditor may subordinate its right to
performance of an obligation by agreement with either the person obligated or another
creditor of the person obligated. Subordination does not create a security interest as against
either the common debtor or a subordinated creditor.</SECTION-TEXT><SOURCE-NOTE><T><B>Source:</B>

<T><B>An express warranty may be inferred from an affirmation of a fact or a
promise</B> by the seller which induces the purchase, on which the buyer
relies, and on which the seller intended that he should so do.
Duncan v. Bd. of County Comm'rs, 154 Colo. 447, 391 P.2d 368 (1964).</T><P></P>
<T><B>An averment at the time of the sale is a warranty provided</B> the
jury finds from the evidence on the trial it was so intended. Such
intention may be reached as an inference or deduction from the facts or
circumstances in connection with all the evidence on the trial, and when
such deduction is made, if it rests upon proper and sufficient evidence, it
becomes proof as a fact of warranty. Rudd v. Rogerson, 133 Colo.
506, 297 P.2d 533 (1956).</T><P></P>
<T><B>There can be no operative warranty unless it be affirmatively
shown that the buyer relied</B> on the affirmation of fact or promise of the
seller. The affirmation asserted as a warranty must have been
operative in causing the sale and must have been understood by the buyer as
being intended as part of the contract. It need not, however, have been
the sole inducement to the purchase, nor need the buyer actually
have been deceived by the statement. Only such reliance is required as is
necessary in contracts generally, and where a representation has entered
into the contract as an intended element thereof and as a part of
the consideration, the requirement that it be an inducement in order to be
operative as a warranty is fully satisfied. Duncan v. Bd. of County
Comm'rs, 154 Colo. 447, 391 P.2d 368 (1964).</T><P></P>
<T><B>There is no duty on the buyer of goods who purchases with an
express warranty to inspect</B> the article purchased, or to exercise care in
discovering any defects, or to investigate the truth of the seller's
statements; rather, he may rely on the contract of the seller for the
delivery of goods which satisfy the warranty, except that the contract may
expressly provide for an inspection or test to be made by the
purchaser as a condition. Rudd v. Rogerson, 133 Colo. 506, 297 P.2d 533
(1956).</T><P></P>
<T><B>The maxim "caveat emptor" has no application</B> to matters
included in an express warranty, and even where the buyer has an equal
opportunity with the seller to form his own judgment as to the
character and condition of the property he may receive and rely on a
warranty instead; opportunity on the part of the buyer to inspect does not
militate against the availability of an express warranty in the sale.
Rudd v. Rogerson, 133 Colo. 506, 297 P.2d 533 (1956).</T><P></P>
<T><B>Where an expressed warranty is given, the buyer is not precluded from

Rudd v. Rogerson, 133 Colo. 506, 297 P.2d 533 (1956).</T><P></P>
<T><B>Even though the buyer makes an inspection the warranty is not rendered
inoperative unless</B> the buyer is clearly relying upon his own investigation

<T><B>Writing does not exclude undertaking by seller.</B> Where a letter addressed
to the buyer and signed by the seller described a machine, but did not include
a provision as to its ability to produce, then,
nevertheless, where it appeared that there were numerous conversations between
the parties and that the buyer fully explained to the seller the machine was to
be used on a mass production basis and its intricacies
were also made known to the seller from the beginning, it cannot be said that
the writing excluded undertakings by the seller in the light of the buyer's
requirements that the seller produce a machine which would
fulfill specific needs. Comet Indus., Inc. v. Best Plastic Container Corp.,

<T><B>Testimony that the seller specifically "guaranteed" or
"promised"</B> that an article would work satisfactorily and that it was

(1964).</T><P></P>
<T><B>The word "sound" when used with reference to many animals</B> and

An option to return a purchase, if one
does not approve, is different from an option
to purchase, if one does approve. In the
former case, the title passes, subject to the
right to rescind and return; in the latter, the
title does not pass until the option to buy is
determined. The former is a sale and delivery,
the latter a bailment which may be converted
into a sale, at the option of the bailee.

<T><B>Consignments are subject to the claims of the buyer's creditors.</B>
Consignment transactions, in which the owner (consignor)
delivers goods to a dealer (consignee) for sale
by that dealer, are governed by the "sale or

goods held on sale or return are subject to the
security interests of the consignee's creditors.

31 Colo. App. 373, 504 P.2d 1113 (1972).</T><P></P>
<T><B>The purpose of this section is</B> to allow a
creditor of a dealer to attach a lien against
property of a third person which is in the
dealer's possession on consignment and to
permit the creditor to treat such property as if
it were owned by the dealer. Am. Nat'l

373, 504 P.2d 1113 (1972).</T><P></P>
<T><B>Security interest not affected by transfer
of possession.</B> A security interest in consigned
goods, having attached while the chattels
were in consignee's possession, is not
affected by a subsequent transfer of possession
of the chattels from the consignee to the
consignor, the transfer of possession of
machines to being in violation of the perfected
security interest in the chattels, and the
secured party is entitled to recover possession
of the goods from consignor or to recover the
value of the goods if a return could not be
had. Am. Nat'l Bank v. Quad Constr.,

<T>This rule is consistent with the rights of a
secured party as they existed prior to the
enactment of the uniform commercial code,
for, under the chattel mortgage statutes in
effect prior to the adoption of the code, the
rights of a mortgagee of chattels were superior
to the rights of one acquiring possession
of the chattels from the mortgagor even
where the transfer purported to be absolute
and in exclusion of the rights of the mortgagee,
and in such cases, the mortgagee could
recover the value of the chattels in an action
against the transferee for conversion.

<T><B>Consignment transactions.</B>
Consignment transactions (i.e., where title does
not pass to the consignee) are covered by
subsection (3), which deems such a transaction

<T><B>Consignment versus bailment.</B>
Where the purpose of the delivery of an item is to

such a transaction clearly is a consignment
and not a bailment, and as such is deemed to
be a "sale or return" as set forth in
subsection (3). Am. Nat'l Bank v. Tina

<T><B>Sufficient evidence.</B> Finding that a dealer "was

absent a finding that the dealer was "generally

engaged in selling the goods of others,

<T><B>Evidence cannot be based on hearsay.</B>
Where the trial court allowed the consignor's witnesses,
both creditors and others, to testify
that consignee was engaged in selling goods of
others but refused to permit these witnesses
to testify to conversations with other persons
concerning the knowledge of such other persons
that consignee was engaged in selling the
goods of others, such testimony was properly
excluded as hearsay. Am. Nat'l Bank v.

P.2d 1113 (1972).</T><P></P>
<T><B>Where the creditor properly protects its interest</B>
in an item delivered to a
dealer by filing according to subsection (3)(c)
and the consignor does not comply with this
provision, nor otherwise does anything to manifest
its interest in the item, the rights of the
creditor are superior. Am. Nat'l Bank v.
Tina Marie Homes, Inc., 28 Colo. App. 477,
476 P.2d 573 (1970).</T><P></P>
<T><B>Right cannot be circumscribed by
estoppel.</B> Since the maxim that "equity follows
the law" applies where a legal right is
clearly established by a secured party under
this section, the equitable doctrine of estoppel
cannot be used to circumscribe that right, and
the effect of this principle is reinforced where
the secured party made no misrepresentation

application of this section.</M></CATCH-LINE>
Each provision of this article with regard to the rights,
obligations, and remedies of the seller, the buyer, purchasers, or other
third parties applies irrespective of title to the goods, except where
the provision refers to such title. Insofar as situations are not
covered by the other provisions of this article and matters concerning
title become material, the following rules apply:
<P N="(1)"></P>
<T>(1)<M>Title to goods cannot pass under a contract for sale prior to
their identification to the contract (section 4-2-501), and unless
otherwise explicitly agreed, the buyer acquires by their identification
a special property as limited by this title. Any retention or
reservation by the seller of the title (property) in goods shipped or
delivered to the buyer is limited in effect to a reservation of a
security interest. Subject to these provisions and to the provisions of
the article on secured transactions (article 9 of this title), title to
goods passes from the seller to the buyer in any manner and on any
conditions explicitly agreed on by the parties.</M></T><P N="(2)"></P>
<T>(2)<M>Unless otherwise explicitly agreed, title passes to the buyer at
the time and place at which the seller completes his performance with
reference to the physical delivery of the goods, despite any reservation
of a security interest and even though a document of title is to be
delivered at a different time or place; and in particular and despite
any reservation of a security interest by the bill of lading:</M></T><P N="(2)(a)"></P>
<T>(a)<M>If the contract requires or authorizes the seller to send the
goods to the buyer but does not require him to deliver them at
destination, title passes to the buyer at the time and place of
shipment; but</M></T><P N="(2)(b)"></P>
<T>(b)<M>If the contract requires delivery at destination, title passes
on tender there.</M></T><P N="(3)"></P>
<T>(3)<M>Unless otherwise explicitly agreed, where delivery is to be made
without moving the goods:</M></T><P N="(3)(a)"></P>
<T>(a)<M>If the seller is to deliver a tangible document of title, title passes at the time
when and the place where the seller delivers such documents, and if the seller is to deliver
an electronic document of title, title passes when the seller delivers the document; or</M></T><P N="(3)(b)"></P>
<T>(b)<M>If the goods are at the time of contracting already identified and no documents
of title are to be delivered, title passes at the time and place of contracting.</M></T><P N="(4)"></P>
<T>(4)<M>A rejection or other refusal by the buyer to receive or retain
the goods, whether or not justified, or a justified revocation of
acceptance revests title to the goods in the seller. Such revesting
occurs by operation of law and is not a "sale".</M></T><P N="(5)"></P>
<T>(5)<M>Notwithstanding any other provision
of this section, when livestock have been delivered under a contract of sale,
if on the accompanying brand inspection certificate or memorandum of brand
inspection certificate the seller has conspicuously noted that payment of
the consideration for the sale has not been received, title does not pass
until payment is made.</M></T></SECTION-TEXT><SOURCE-NOTE><T><B>Source:</B>

<T><B>Delivery of automobiles sufficient to pass title.</B>
Delivery of automobiles to buyer who had made payment by check which

<T><B>Failure to deliver bill of sale after giving buyer possession of assets.</B>
Where plaintiffs' testimony revealed that it was their intent
to sell the business and its assets to the buyer, the failure to deliver the bill
of sale after giving the buyer possession of the assets was, at most,
a reservation of title, and as such acted as a reservation of a security
interest in the property. Young v. Golden State Bank, 39 Colo. App. 45,
560 P.2d 855 (1977).</T><P></P>
<T><B>Passage of title to livestock.</B>
The livestock bill of sale laws are not superseded by the UCC,
and passage of title to livestock in Colorado is accomplished by compliance
with article 54 of title 35. When neither party has complied with the livestock
bill of sale laws, however, the law merchant, as embodied in the UCC provisions
governing passage of title, applies.

<T>In the law governing breach of warranty, the notice requirement serves
three useful purposes: First, notice provides the seller a chance to correct
any defect; second, notice affords the seller an opportunity to prepare
for negotiation and litigation; and third, notice provides the seller a
safeguard against stale claims being asserted after it is too late for the
manufacturer or seller to investigate them. Prutch v. Ford Motor Co., 618

<T><B>There is adequate and timely notice of the breach where the seller
is contacted immediately</B> after an item is installed and told that it is
not working. Irrigation Motor &amp; Pump Co. v. Belcher, 29 Colo. App. 343,
483 P.2d 980 (1971).</T><P></P>

Although a formal notice was not given, where the buyer communicated with
the seller and notified him of the defects in the goods and the seller
acquired firsthand knowledge, the seller could scarcely
have concluded that these were mere protests in view of the fact that the

<T><B>Burden on buyer to prove defects existed at time of sale.</B> The burden

setting up such defects as an affirmative defense in an action for the
price, to prove that the defects existed at the time of sale and did not
result from deterioration after shipment or from the buyer's negligence
after he came into possession of the property, since there is no
presumption that the defects discovered after delivery existed at the time
of sale. Vanadium Corp. of Am. v. Wesco Stores Co., 135 Colo. 77, 308

<T><B>Buyer must be able to transfer unencumbered title.</B>
In order to exercise the remedy of revocation after acceptance,

awards buyer this remedy, be in a position to transfer an unencumbered title
to the seller.
Moeller Mfg., Inc. v. Mattis, 33 Colo. App. 300, 519 P.2d 1218 (1974).</T><P></P>
<T><B>There is no requirement under the provisions of the UCC that on revocation
of acceptance a buyer must deliver title</B> to the goods to the seller. Under
§ 4-2-711 (3), a buyer retains a
security interest in goods in his possession for any payment made on their
price and may resell the goods in the same manner as an aggrieved seller. And,
where a buyer does not exercise his right of
resale, generally all that is required is that the buyer assign to the seller
all of his interest in the goods. Jackson v. Rocky Mtn. Datsun, Inc., 693

<T><B>Remedy is for damages under § 4-2-714.</B>

<T><B>Buyer vested with security interest upon revocation.</B>
If a revocation of acceptance of a mobile home is justifiable
under this section, § 4-2-711 (3) vests the buyer with a security interest
in the home, and such an interest authorizes continued possession to
preserve the collateral, pursuant to § 4-9-207 (1) and (4), subject
to the seller's right to an offset for the rental value of the home.

<T><B>Buyer may revoke acceptance if he accepts goods on the reasonable assumption
that
a

nonconformity is not "seasonably cured". Buyer is not

<T><B>When the buyer reaccepts goods with the understanding that the seller will cure

<T><B>Buyer was not required to set out in detail the car's nonconformities</B> in her

<T><B>Contrary to trial court's determination, there is no "formal notice of revocation"
requirement under this section, nor does it exist under § 4-2-607.</B> This section
does not require that a revocation of acceptance assume any particular format, but rather
that the content of the notice be determined by "considerations of good faith, prevention
of surprise, and reasonable adjustment." The notice of revocation, to be sufficient,
should
fairly apprise the seller that the buyer wants to give back the goods and receive a
substitute or money in return. Here, letter that described in detail dryers' alleged defects,
attempted to reject acceptance of the dryers, demanded that seller remove the machines
from the premises, and requested that damages be paid to buyer and the laundromat
owner provided adequate notice of revocation. Cissell Mfg. Co. v. Park, 36 P.3d 85
(Colo. App. 2001).</T><P></P>
<T><B>To prove a valid revocation of acceptance, a buyer must show, among other
things, that the goods were nonconforming.</B> Determination of an item's
nonconformity hinges on whether it substantially impairs its value to the buyer. Whether
goods are nonconforming requires reference to the terms of the contract and the law of
warranty. If the goods are contracted for and as warranted, they cannot be
nonconforming. Cissell Mfg. Co. v. Park, 36 P.3d 85 (Colo. App. 2001).</T><AN-DIV>III.<M>REASONABLE TIME.</M></AN-DIV>

Since § 4-2-715 is similar to repealed § 121-1-70, C.R.S. 1963, and
§ 121-1-70, CRS 53 (uniform sales act), relevant cases construing those
provisions have been included in the annotations to this section.</T><P></P>
<T><B>Interest and carrying charges are consequential damages.</B>
Where the goods purchased are entirely worthless and the only way buyer can
be made whole is by awarding him the full amount of the obligation he
undertook to pay at the time he purchased the goods, then the
interest and carrying charges incurred at the time the sale was made are
clearly consequential damages directly resulting from the breach of
warranty. Cherokee Inv. Co. v. Voiles, 166 Colo. 270, 443 P.2d 727 (1968).</T><P></P>
<T><B>Special damages where machine is unsuitable.</B>
Where there is a breach of a special warranty whereby a seller undertakes
to build a machine suitable for a mass production purpose, the buyer is
entitled to special damages for its expenditure in the manufacture of the
tools and dies to be used with the machine and to those expenditures
reasonably attributed to efforts to adjust and repair the machine before
the date when notice of breach of warranty was given to the buyer. Comet
Indus., Inc. v. Best Plastic Container Corp., 222 F. Supp. 723 (D. Colo. 1963).</T><P></P>
<T><B>The claim of a buyer for damages for loss of profits cannot be
allowed where</B> these were not sufficiently proven and where they are in
law remote. Comet Indus., Inc. v. Best Plastic Container Corp., 222 F.
Supp. 723 (D. Colo. 1963).</T><P></P>
<T><B>Code rejects "tacit agreement" test.</B>
The Colorado statutory scheme rejects the "tacit agreement" test that would
permit consequential damages only if the seller specifically contemplated
or actually assumed the risk of such damages. Prutch v. Ford Motor Co.,
618 P.2d 657 (Colo. 1980).</T><P></P>
<T><B>The element which triggers recovery of consequential damages
under subsection (2)(a)</B> is foreseeability. Subsection (2)(a)
means that consequential damages are recoverable whenever those damages
were reasonably foreseeable by the seller when he entered the contract.

on other grounds, 618 P.2d 657 (Colo. 1980).</T><P></P>
<T>Where a buyer's use of a product which he knows is defective
is foreseeable, the seller's liability for consequential damages
is not cut off. Prutch v. Ford Motor Co., 40 Colo. App. 129,
574 P.2d 102 (1977), rev'd on other grounds, 618 P.2d 657 (Colo. 1980).</T><P></P>
<T>A manufacturer knowing that its products will be used for crop production

cause crop losses. Prutch v. Ford Motor Co., 618 P.2d 657 (Colo. 1980).</T><P></P>
<T><B>"Reason to know" formulation not exclusive remedy in fraud suits.</B>
The code does not require that the "reason to know" formulation be applied in
fraud suits to the exclusion of other remedies; it only provides that the
remedies available under the "reason to know" formulation are included
among the remedies available to a defrauded purchaser.
Wagner v. Dan Unfug Motors, Inc., 35 Colo. App. 102, 529 P.2d 656 (1974).</T><P></P>
<T><B>Attempt to mitigate losses not intervening cause of damages.</B>
Where plaintiffs, in deciding to continue farming with the knowledge that
their equipment might continue to malfunction, actually mitigated their
losses, their decision to try to produce at least part of a normal crop,
rather than no crop at all, was required by their "duty to lessen, rather
than increase", their damages and was not an intervening cause of damages.

In subsection (1), Colorado substituted the three-year statute of limitations
in § 13-80-101 for the four-year statute of limitations in the uniform
act. The official text also provided that the parties could
reduce the period of limitation to a minimum of one year, but they could not
extend the period. Colorado has provided that the period of limitation may
not be reduced or extended.</T></EDITORS-NOTE><COMMENT-HEAD>ANNOTATION</COMMENT-HEAD><ANNO-NOTE><ANNO-TEXT></ANNO-TEXT>

<T><B>Whether arbitration is an "action" subject to limitation period</B> does not

<T><B>Running of statute of limitations for breach of express warranty.</B> In

a breach. D.O.M. Farms v. Nakamoto, 718 P.2d 262 (Colo. App. 1986).</T><P></P>

Harvestore Prods., 776 P.2d 1125 (Colo. App. 1989).</T><P></P>
<T><B>Warranty did not extend to future performance of goods and buyer's cause
of action accrued when tender of delivery was made</B> where manufacturer, by
provisions of sale contract, did not explicitly promise that the product would
not malfunction, only that, if it did, it would be repaired or replaced. Boyd
v. A.O. Smith Harvestore Prods., 776 P.2d 1125 (Colo. App. 1989).</T><P></P>
<T><B>Actions of seller toll statute of limitations.</B>
Where a seller delivered a good, made repeated assurances that the product
would be repaired to meet contract performance requirements and made efforts
to improve the product, those promises and efforts tolled the statute of
limitations in subsection (1) until the seller denied liability and refused
to make further efforts to improve the product. Colorado-Ute Elec. Ass'n
v. Envirotech Corp., 524 F. Supp. 1152 (D. Colo. 1981).</T><P></P>
<T>Where seller guaranteed buyer that product would perform at a certain level of
reliability for successive intervals until a specified time, this guarantee effectively
delayed
commencement of the limitations period for seeking a "true fix" remedy until that time.

provisions of § 13-81-103 apply.

The following annotations include cases decided under former provisions
similar to this section.</T><P></P>
<T><B>Conditional language in promissory note referencing conditions in the
bill of sale and covenants not to compete</B> renders it nonnegotiable but
does not make the note unenforceable. DBA Enter., Inc. v. Findlay, 923 P.2d
298 (Colo. App. 1996).</T><P></P>
<T><B>A note authorizing confession of judgment</B> in the event of nonpayment
does not render the note nonnegotiable. Axelson v. Dailey Coop. Co., 88
Colo. 555, 298 P. 957 (1931).</T><P></P>
<T><B>The authority to confess judgment is construed strictly</B> against
the party in whose favor it is given. Stewart v. Pub. Indus. Bank, 85
Colo. 546, 277 P. 782 (1929).</T><P></P>
<T><B>"Owing" construed as "due".</B>
Where a note was made payable on or before 12 months after date, to be paid
in monthly installments, a provision permitting a judgment for amounts then
"owing", was construed to permit a judgment for amounts then
"due". Stewart v. Pub. Indus. Bank, 85 Colo. 546, 277 P. 782 (1929).</T><P></P>
<T><B>Note payable in installments is negotiable.</B> A promissory note made
payable on or before 12 months after date to be paid in monthly
installments is negotiable, inasmuch as principal of note payable one year
from date is "owing" when note is given but is not then
"due". Stewart v. Pub. Indus. Bank, 85 Colo. 546, 277 P. 782 (1929).</T><P></P>
<T><B>Where the holder of a note payable in installments agrees to
postpone</B> subsequent installments upon the payment of pending interim
installments, thereby extending the time of the installments, there is an
accord and satisfaction without regard to the question of consideration for
an extension where the debtor fulfills the requirements. French v.
Commercial Credit Co., 99 Colo. 447, 64 P.2d 127 (1936).</T><P></P>
<T><B>Principal not altered as basis of interest.</B>
Provision in note that upon a contingency a portion of the note should be
cancelled does not alter the principal amount of the note as the basis of
interest computation. Colo. Herald Publ'g Co. v. Neuhaus, 117 Colo.
172, 184 P.2d 1011 (1947).</T><P></P>

validity</B> of instrument. Metro. State Bank v. McNutt, 73 Colo. 291,
215 P. 151 (1923).</T><P></P>
<T><B>For a promissory note to be negotiable,</B>
and to pass to an indorsee thereof the protections afforded to a
"holder in due course", it must contain both an unconditional
promise to pay and a fixed or determinable date of payment. Bank of
Kimball v. Rostek, 161 Colo. 584, 423 P.2d 579 (1967).</T><P></P>
<T><B>To be a negotiable instrument subject to the statutes governing such
instruments,
an instrument must contain an unconditional promise to pay a fixed amount of money on
demand or at a definite time.</B> If a written agreement makes an obligation to pay
subject to an express condition, not payable on demand, the agreement is not a negotiable
instrument, and the statutory provisions relating to negotiable instruments are
inapplicable
to the transaction. Reid v. Pyle, 51 P.3d 1064 (Colo. App. 2002).</T><P></P>
<T>Where plaintiff's obligation to pay was expressly conditioned on "the sale or
transference" of the property, the promissory note was not a negotiable instrument. Reid
v.
Pyle, 51 P.3d 1064 (Colo. App. 2002).</T><P></P>
<T><B>A note conditioned on its face on services to be rendered</B> and
which is not to be paid until the object of the services is secured is
nonnegotiable. Mulligan v. Smith, 13 Colo. App. 231, 57 P. 731 (1899).</T><P></P>
<T><B>Recitation that note is secured does not render a note nonnegotiable.</B>
A promissory note containing an unconditional promise to pay a definite
amount on demand is not rendered nonnegotiable because it recites that it
is secured by a quitclaim deed. First Nat'l Bank v. Mineral Farm Co., 17
Colo. App. 452, 68 P. 981 (1902).</T><P></P>
<T><B>Provisions for foreclosure.</B>
Where a negotiable note is secured by a deed of trust, provisions in the
deed providing for foreclosure upon the grantor's failure to pay taxes and
insurance do not render the note uncertain as to amount or time of payment.
Frost v. Fisher, 13 Colo. App. 322, 58 P. 872 (1899).</T><P></P>
<T><B>Uncertainty as to time of payment of a note does not
affect it as an enforceable contract</B> between the parties thereto,
although it makes it nonnegotiable. Simpson v. Baber, 74 Colo. 175,
220 P. 235 (1923).</T><P></P>
<T><B>The fact that a note does not contain the words "to order" or
"to bearer"</B> does not affect its negotiability.

there is no reason why the latter may not contract to bear the result
occasioned by his own default. Florence Oil Ref. Co. v. Hiawatha Gas, Oil,
&amp; Ref. Co., 55 Colo. 378, 135 P. 454 (1913).</T><P></P>
<T><B>Indemnification for collection expenses.</B> A provision for a
fixed amount for attorney fees is an agreement to indemnify the holder
against expenses incurred in the employing of an attorney for the
enforcement of collection when the maker fails to keep his agreement.
Florence Oil Ref. Co. v. Hiawatha Gas, Oil, &amp; Ref. Co., 55 Colo. 378,
135 P. 454 (1913).</T><P></P>
<T><B>The holder can only recover such part thereof as will reimburse him
for the reasonable and necessary attorney fees</B> he has been compelled to
pay, or has become liable for, in enforcing the collection of the note.
Florence Oil Ref. Co. v. Hiawatha Gas, Oil, &amp; Ref. Co., 55 Colo. 378,
135 P. 454 (1913).</T><P></P>
<T><B>Reasonableness of attorney fees is implicit in such an agreement.</B> Where
under the terms of a
note, the holder is authorized to collect attorney fees for collection
costs in case of default, implicit in such agreement is the recognition
that such attorney fees will be reasonable, that is, commensurate with
the actual labor and time expended by the attorney. Haffke v. Linker, 30
Colo. App. 61, 489 P.2d 1050 (1971).</T><P></P>
<T><B>Expenses incurred must be actual and bona fide expenses.</B> Where a note
provides for an
attorney fee, and the holder of the note employs counsel, who
successfully brings suit on the note, a reasonable fee fixed by the court
may be included in the judgment. Such a provision amounts to an agreement
to indemnify the holder of the note against expenses actually incurred, and
the payment or obligation must be actual, bona fide, and reasonable. Luby
v. Jefferson County Bank, 28 Colo. App. 441, 476 P.2d 292 (1970).</T><P></P>
<T><B>Attorney fees must be shown to have been incurred and reasonable.</B> The
holder of a note providing for the payment
of reasonable attorney fees upon collection is entitled to the recovery
of such a fee only upon a showing that the fee actually has been paid or
incurred, and that the amount of the fee is reasonable. Haffke v. Linker,
30 Colo. App. 76, 489 P.2d 1047 (1971).</T><P></P>
<T><B>Necessity to prove that fees were actually incurred.</B> Proof that
attorney
fees provided for by a promissory note have actually been paid or incurred
is a material matter to be proven, because recompense is justified only as
indemnity to the note holder; absent proof of payment or obligation, there
is nothing to indemnify, and hence there can be no recovery. Reese v.
Lietzan, 160 Colo. 253, 419 P.2d 959 (1966).</T><P></P>
<T><B>Fact of agreement does not establish reasonableness.</B> Merely
because there is an agreement as to a contingent fee between the holder and
an attorney does not mean that the sum agreed upon is a reasonable fee to
be assessed against the maker in an action to collect the balance due on
default. Haffke v. Linker, 30 Colo. App. 61, 489 P.2d 1050 (1971).</T><P></P>
<T><B>Testimony of usual fee does not establish reasonableness.</B> Testimony
relating only to the
usual fee arrangement between the holder of a note and an attorney employed
by the holder to collect the note does not establish the reasonableness of
an attorney fee which a holder is entitled to recover from the maker in a
suit on a promissory note. Haffke v. Linker, 30 Colo. App. 76, 489 P.2d
1047 (1971).</T></ANNO-NOTE><SECTION-TEXT><P N="(a)"></P>

(a)<M>Except as
provided in this section, for the purposes of section 4-3-104 (a),
a promise or order is unconditional unless it states (i) an
express condition to payment, (ii) that the promise or order is
subject to or governed by another writing, or (iii) that rights
or obligations with respect to the promise or order are stated in
another writing. A reference to another writing does not of
itself make the promise or order conditional.</M><P N="(b)"></P>
<T>(b)<M>A promise or order is not made conditional (i) by a

appears on the promise or order, the condition does not make the
promise or order conditional for the purposes of section 4-3-104
(a). If the person whose specimen signature appears on an

countersign is a defense to the obligation of the issuer, but the

<T><B>Under common law and N.I.L.</B> the negotiable instruments law adopted
the common-law rule providing that where a check is payable to the order of
two or more persons who are not partners, all of them had to indorse unless
the one so doing had authority to indorse for the other payees, and this
joint indorsement was necessary for a complete negotiation; where one of
the payees failed to indorse, the negotiability of the check was completely
destroyed. Am. Nat'l Bank v. First Nat'l Bank, 130 Colo. 557,
277 P.2d 951 (1954).</T><P></P>
<T><B>In the absence of a necessary indorsement by a co-payee the instrument
is nonnegotiable</B> and not subject to cashing. F. R. Orr Constr. Co.
v. Ready Mixed Concrete Co., 28 Colo. App. 273, 472 P.2d 193 (1970).</T><P></P>
<T><B>Holder acquires only a chose in action.</B>
The failure of one of two joint payees to indorse destroys the
negotiability of a check, and the holder of the check acquires only as an
assignee of a nonnegotiable chose in action the interest of the payee who
did indorse; as such an assignee, his interest in the proceeds of the check
is to be determined. Skinner v. Mortgage Inv. Co., 165 Colo. 241, 438 P.2d
504 (1968). See Am. Nat'l Bank v. First Nat'l Bank, 130 Colo. 557,
277 P.2d 951 (1954).</T><P></P>
<T><B>The drawee bank is authorized to pay out funds belonging to its
depositor when,</B> and only when, the check is indorsed by the payees
therein, or by persons who have satisfied it or the bank to which the check
is presented for payment of their right to the proceeds. Am. Nat'l
Bank v. First Nat'l Bank, 130 Colo. 557, 277 P.2d 951 (1954).</T><P></P>
<T><B>In the absence of actual fault on the part of the drawee,</B> its
failure to observe the fact of the absence of the indorsement of one of the
payees, due entirely to the fault or neglect of the holder, will not
preclude its recovery. Am. Nat'l Bank v. First Nat'l Bank, 130 Colo.
557, 277 P.2d 951 (1954).</T><P></P>
<T><B>As a greater duty is imposed on the holder.</B>
The absence of an indorsement by the holder is as serious, if not more so,
than a forged indorsement; the first is easily discernible while the other
is the result of an error in the identification of the payee.
Consequently, if it is the duty of the bank cashing the check to know to a
positive certainty the identity of the payee named therein and its failure
so to do imposes a duty of reimbursing the drawee, it seems clear that the
failure to secure the indorsement of all of the payees imposes an even
greater duty on the holder. Am. Nat'l Bank v. First Nat'l Bank, 130
Colo. 557, 277 P.2d 951 (1954).</T></ANNO-NOTE><SECTION-TEXT><P></P>

contrary to a restrictive indorsement "pay any bank", because the latter
special indorsement superseded the restrictive indorsement and such action by
the depository bank was the equivalent of a constructive cancellation. Thus,
any satisfaction to the ensuing holder was not inconsistent with the terms of
the previous restrictive indorsement. Lamson v. Commercial Credit Corp., 187

Reacquisition of an instrument
occurs if it is transferred to a former holder, by negotiation or
otherwise. A former holder who reacquires the instrument may
cancel indorsements made after the reacquirer first became a
holder of the instrument. If the cancellation causes the
instrument to be payable to the reacquirer or to bearer, the
reacquirer may negotiate the instrument. An indorser whose
indorsement is canceled is discharged, and the discharge is

<T><B>If there is nothing on the face of a negotiable instrument, or in the
written indorsement or assignment, to notify</B> the assignee that the
instrument was originally given upon an illegal consideration (gambling
debts excepted) or obtained through fraud, the assignee who pays value
therefor, and takes the same in good faith before maturity, may recover as
against the maker. And this fact is true even though such assignee be in
possession of facts or circumstances sufficient to arouse suspicion in the
mind of a person of ordinary prudence and though he is guilty of negligence
in not first following up such information for the purpose of discovering
the fraud or illegality to which the suspicious circumstances may point.
This rule is founded upon commercial necessity, for the untrammeled
circulation of these instruments is a matter of supreme importance in the
vast field of mercantile transactions; drafts, bills of exchange and other
negotiable instruments take the place of money, and circulate almost as
freely. Hence, to hold that each assignee must, before accepting them,
inquire into each and every suspicious circumstance bearing upon the
original execution, or pointing to possible defenses in a suit between the
original parties, would produce serious inconveniences to the commercial
world. Hukill v. McGinnis, 70 Colo. 455, 202 P. 110 (1921); Hendrickson v.

A promissory note, otherwise in due form, is complete and regular upon its
face although it bears no revenue stamps, since the absence of revenue
stamps is no notice to an indorsee of a promissory note of any infirmity in
the instrument or defect in the title of the person negotiating it, is not
a suspicious circumstance, and is no evidence that the note was taken in
bad faith. Metro. State Bank v. McNutt, 73 Colo. 291, 215 P. 151 (1923).</T><P></P>
<T><B>Whether an instrument is complete and regular on its face is
questionable where</B> an officer of a payee bank testifies that in 90 to 100
percent of similar cases where instruments are signed blank, they are
filled in when delivered to the bank. Atkinson v. Englewood State Bank,
141 Colo. 436, 34 P.2d 702 (1960).</T><P></P>
<T><B>Tests other than "actual knowledge" may be used</B> in resolving the issue
of whether an endorsee of a promissory note is a holder in due course including
whether the holder had in his possession facts from which he had reason
to know of the defenses "at the time in question". The critical time for
such notice is when the party comes into possession of the note as a holder.
Salter v. Vanotti, 42 Colo. App. 448, 599 P.2d 962 (1979).</T><P></P>
<T><B>Duty to inquire as to possible defenses.</B> Where an instrument is regular
on its face there is no duty on the part of a check cashing service to inquire
as to possible defenses, unless circumstances of which the holder has knowledge
are of such a nature that the failure to inquire reveals a deliberate desire to
evade knowledge because of a fear that investigation would disclose the
existence of a defense. Money Mart Check Cashing Center, Inc. v. Epicycle
Corp., 667 P.2d 1372 (Colo. 1983).</T><P></P>
<T><B>When inquiry required.</B> If the purchaser has actual knowledge of facts
which would apprise him of possible irregularities some inquiry is required
by the notice provisions of the UCC. Salter v. Vanotti, 42 Colo. App. 448,
599 P.2d 962 (1979).</T><P></P>
<T><B>Refusal to investigate.</B> The protection afforded a holder in due course
cannot be used to shield one who simply refuses to investigate when the
facts known to him suggest an irregularity concerning the commercial paper
he purchases. Salter v. Vanotti, 42 Colo. App. 448, 599 P.2d 962 (1979).</T><P></P>

679 P.2d 599 (Colo. 1984).</T><P></P>
<T><B>Instrument must be acquired before maturity.</B> One of the essentials to
constitute a holder in due course is that the instrument must have been
acquired before maturity. First Nat'l Bank v. Lewis, 57 Colo. 124, 139 P. 1102
(1914).</T><P></P>
<T><B>One who acquires a note after its maturity is not a holder in due
course.</B> See Vigil v. Pacheco, 95 Colo. 405, 36 P.2d 766 (1934).</T><P></P>
<T><B>Certified check not mature before presentment.</B> A check certified to the
payee by the bank on which it is drawn as accepted payable at the same bank
does not mature until presented to such bank for payment, and a purchaser by
indorsement before such presentment is a holder in due course, but not after
maturity. Citizens' Nat'l Bank v. First Nat'l Bank, 66 Colo. 426, 182 P. 12
(1919).</T><P></P>
<T><B>Record supported the trial court's finding that the bank had no notice of

did not specify any offset against it. First Nat. Bank v. Lohman, 827 P.2d

<T><B>Knowledge that pledgor of note was treasurer of payee.</B>
Purchaser's knowledge, at the time of accepting a note, that the pledgor

where in pledging the note the pledgor exercised no function of treasurer.

<T><B>One cannot recover amount of a draft given without consideration,</B> there

Jamison, 89 Colo. 278, 1 P.2d 925 (1931).</T><P></P>
<T><B>Partial failure of consideration is a defense pro tanto only</B> to an action

<T><B>Though vendor who is unable to convey title cannot recover on note given in

possession, he is, in equity, entitled to protection. Gillett v. Cheairs, 79
Colo. 20, 243 P. 1112 (1926).</T><P></P>
<T><B>Where a guaranteed renewal note is given</B> in payment of, or as security
for an antecedent obligation to pay loan that maker obtained from bank, want of
consideration is no defense to suit by bank against guarantors of note which is
not paid by insolvent maker. State Bank v. Owens, 31 Colo. App. 351, 502 P.2d
965 (1972).</T><P></P>
<T><B>The validity of consideration created by antecedent debt is not affected by
fact that the old note is not surrendered,</B> provided there is no agreement to
return the old note, which has not been transferred to one other than the payee
of the new note. Wolf v. Larimer County Bank &amp; Trust Co., 79 Colo. 376, 246 P.
285 (1926).</T><P></P>
<T><B>Nonperformance constitutes defense.</B> Where the directors and stockholders
of an insolvent state bank gave their individual notes to the bank which took
over the assets on the promise of the latter to perform certain conditions,
nonperformance of conditions constituted a defense to liability on the notes.
Weicker v. Bromfield, 34 F.2d 377 (10th Cir. 1929).</T><P></P>
<T><B>Where the purpose is served.</B> Where defendant executed notes in payment
of his share of the expense of building a drain ditch the ditch being built and
serving its purpose, he could not avoid payment of his notes because the ditch
was not placed on a certain section line as provided in the agreement, under
the contention that this constituted a failure of consideration. Fort v.

<T><B>Promissory note which shows on its face that it is given for value imports
consideration.</B> Neal v. Wilson County Bank, 83 Colo. 118, 263 P. 18 (1927).</T><P></P>
<T><B>Maker must overcome presumption of consideration.</B> Since a note is prima
facie presumed to be based on a valuable consideration and that one whose
signature is placed thereon is presumed to have become a party for value, the
maker, when sued by the payee, must overcome the presumption by showing, as an
affirmative defense, that there was an absence or failure of consideration.
Luby v. Jefferson County Bank, 28 Colo. App. 441, 476 P.2d 292 (1970).</T><P></P>
<T><B>Burden is on party pleading such.</B> In an action on a promissory note, the

<T><B>Absence of failure of consideration is an affirmative defense.</B> Luby v.
Jefferson County Bank, 28 Colo. App. 441, 476 P.2d 292 (1970).</T><P></P>
<T><B>Defense must be established by fair preponderance of evidence.</B> Under
this section a defendant who affirmatively pleads absence or failure of
consideration has the burden of establishing his defense by a fair
preponderance of the evidence, which burden remains with him throughout the
trial. Hickman-Lunbeck Grocery Co. v. Hager, 75 Colo. 554, 227 P. 829 (1924).</T><P></P>
<T><B>Defense fails where no evidence.</B> A duly executed promissory note
imports
consideration, and no evidence to the contrary being introduced, a defensive
allegation of no consideration, fails. Viles v. Jackson, 105 Colo. 68, 94 P.2d
1085 (1939).</T><P></P>
<T><B>Failure of consideration for a promissory note may be shown by parol</B>
where the action is between the original parties to the note. Berta v.
Rocchio, 149 Colo. 325, 369 P.2d 51 (1962).</T><P></P>
<T><B>Where agreement recites payment in full.</B> Where notes are given in
accordance with an agreement which recites they are payment in full for rights
conveyed thereby, parol evidence cannot be introduced to prove there was to be
additional consideration for the notes. Collins v. Shaffer, 66 Colo. 84, 179
P. 152 (1919).</T><P></P>
<T><B>Notwithstanding, presumption does not apply where fiduciary relationship.</B>
The general presumption of consideration of promissory notes is overcome by
the specific presumption arising out of where there is a fiduciary
relationship, in which case the claimant must overcome, by evidence, the
presumption of undue influence with which the transaction is tainted because of
the existence of the fiduciary relationship. Arnold v. Abernethy, 134 Colo.

<T><B>A single consideration which moves to any one of two or more comakers of
a note will be adequate</B> or sufficient to support the undertaking of them all.
Luby v. Jefferson County Bank, 28 Colo. App. 441, 476 P.2d 292 (1970).</T><P></P>
<T><B>The fact that the proceeds of the loan go to a comaker</B> of the note or to

Jefferson County Bank, 28 Colo. App. 441, 476 P.2d 292 (1970).</T><P></P>
<T><B>Extension of the time for the payment of a sum of money is a sufficient

74 Colo. 400, 222 P. 404 (1924).</T><P></P>
<T><B>Extension of the time for the payment of a sum of money does not promise to
continue paying interest.</B> An extension for time of payment is not invalid
for lack of consideration where such extension does not promise to continue to
pay interest, for in such circumstances the promise to pay interest is implied.
Adamson v. Bosick, 82 Colo. 309, 259 P. 513 (1927).</T><P></P>
<T><B>Where unpaid interest due after maturity is added to the past due

<T><B>Between the immediate parties, payment in advance of installment and
interest payments</B> on a promissory note are sufficient consideration for an

receipt of money from the annual sale of crops. Kuhlman v. McCormick, 116
Colo. 300, 180 P.2d 863 (1947).</T><P></P>

<T><B>Including for attorney's fees.</B> An extension of time for payment of an
account is sufficient consideration for a provision for attorney's fees in
notes taken. Taylor v. Continental Supply Co., 16 F.2d 578 (8th Cir. 1926).</T><P></P>
<T><B>Where a maker of a note makes a partial payment</B> on it by a check of
another which is dishonored and then subsequently makes another note for the

sufficient consideration for the new indebtedness. Lomax v. Colo. Nat'l

<T><B>Note given to reduce excess loan to corporation.</B> A promissory note given

allege lack of consideration for such note, as payment of the money discharged
a liability as a stockholder. Campbell v. Hoch, 88 Colo. 303, 295 P. 798
(1931).</T><P></P>
<T><B>Where a party, after the discounting of a note, indorses it pursuant to a
previous agreement,</B> his act in signing relates back to the original contract

such promise. Loveland v. Sigel-Campion
Live Stock Co., 77 Colo. 22, 234 P. 168 (1925).</T><P></P>
<T><B>Where maker executes a note without consideration and the payee indorses it
"without recourse",</B> leaving such with the maker who credits payment

the note to this individual, the fact of no consideration as to the original
transaction does not avail the maker as against this third party who took under
an unqualified indorsement. Beach v. Bennett, 16 Colo. App. 459, 66 P. 567

The maker of a promissory note may not defend in an action against him by a

<T><B>One cannot avoid liability on a note even if it be conceded that

<T><B>When duty to inquire as to defenses exists.</B> Where an instrument is
regular on its face there is no duty on the part of a check cashing service to
inquire as to possible defenses, unless circumstances of which the holder in
due course has knowledge are of such a nature that the failure to inquire
reveals a deliberate desire to evade knowledge because of a fear that
investigation would disclose the existence of a defense. Money Mart Check

<T><B>Maker's claim in her affidavit that she was deceived as to the nature of

608 (Colo. App. 1992).</T><P></P>
<T><B>If the signers on a note are able to prove close connectedness</B> between
the original payee of the note and an assignee thereof, then such relationship
effectively invalidates the assignee's claim to a holder in due course status

the assignee. Stotler v. Geibank Indus. Bank, 827 P.2d 608 (Colo. App. 1992).</T><AN-SUB>B.<N></N>Duress.</AN-SUB>

<T><B>Threat of sending husband to penitentiary is duress.</B> Where a wife,
who is old and in poor health, executes a note under a threat to send her
husband, who is even older than she, to the penitentiary, there is duress
which voids the note; and such duress is a continuing one which is not
waived by the execution of a renewal of such note. Union Nat'l Bank v.
Wright, 79 Colo. 574, 247 P. 453 (1926).</T><P></P>
<T><B>Refusal to release deed of trust is not duress.</B> The declaration of a

the gaming statute where the law which prevails in the state where the

purchaser, provided the law of the state concerned is not so shocking to
the moral sense of the community so as to make an exception to the rule

<T><B>Temporary security for a loan.</B>
Where a promissory note is in the hands of the corporation payee, named

in fact made, and the note afterwards restored to the corporation. Divine

<T><B>Being signed by another.</B> Promissory notes signed and
delivered under an express agreement and condition that they are not to

<T><B>Where payment is to be paid from dividends.</B> In an action by an
assignee after maturity, upon a note where a corporation was the payee, a
parol agreement made contemporaneous with the execution of the note to the
effect that the note would be paid from the maker's share in the dividends
of the corporation, and not otherwise, is a complete defense to the

<T><B>Condition of prescribed purchase for maker gives negotiation

<T><B>Latter special indorsement superseded restrictive indorsement.</B>
Where a depository bank specially indorsed a check to the plaintiff, who
became a holder in his own right, payment by the maker to the plaintiff
was not contrary to a restrictive indorsement "pay any bank",
because the latter special indorsement superseded the restrictive
indorsement and such action by the depository bank was the equivalent of
a constructive cancellation. Thus, any satisfaction to the ensuing holder was
not inconsistent with the terms of the previous restrictive indorsement.

(a)<M>In an action with respect to an instrument, the
authenticity of, and authority to make, each signature on the
instrument is admitted unless specifically denied in the
pleadings. If the validity of a signature is denied in the
pleadings, the burden of establishing validity is on the person
claiming validity, but the signature is presumed to be authentic
and authorized unless the action is to enforce the liability of
the purported signer and the signer is dead or incompetent at the
time of trial of the issue of validity of the signature. If an
action to enforce the instrument is brought against a person as
the undisclosed principal of a person who signed the instrument
as a party to the instrument, the plaintiff has the burden of
establishing that the defendant is liable on the instrument as a
represented person under section 4-3-402 (a).</M><P N="(b)"></P>
<T>(b)<M>If the validity of signatures is admitted or proved and
there is compliance with subsection (a) of this section, a
plaintiff producing the instrument is entitled to payment if the
plaintiff proves entitlement to enforce the instrument under
section 4-3-301, unless the defendant proves a defense or claim
in recoupment. If a defense or claim in recoupment is proved, the
right to payment of the plaintiff is subject to the defense or
claim, except to the extent the plaintiff proves that the
plaintiff has rights of a holder in due course which are not
subject to the defense or claim.</M></T></SECTION-TEXT><SOURCE-NOTE><T><B>Source:</B>

Waterman v. Sullivan, 156 Colo. 195, 397 P.2d 739 (1964).</T><P></P>
<T><B>A holder is entitled to recover.</B> A plaintiff, being holder of a note in
his possession, is entitled to have it admitted in evidence, establishing a
prima facie right to recover thereon. Myrick v. Garcia, 138 Colo. 298, 332
P.2d 900 (1958).</T><P></P>
<T><B>Whether a promissory note is negotiable or not is immaterial,</B> as the same
result would obtain, a holder of an instrument being entitled to sue thereon as
the prima facie owner. Myrick v. Garcia, 138 Colo. 298, 332 P.2d 900 (1958).</T><P></P>
<T><B>Assignee of negotiable instrument suing thereon need not plead
specific facts</B> from which his assignor derives the status of a holder in

<T><B>Where the answer of the maker denies that the holder is the owner</B>
of the note sued upon, such answer merely has the effect of putting this
defense in issue, and thus the holder is not obliged to prove such
ownership until maker's evidence challenges his prima facie title. Myrick

<T><B>The burden is on the holder.</B> When it is shown that the title of any
person who has negotiated a promissory note is defective, the burden is on the
holder to prove that he, or some person under whom he claims, acquired the
title as a holder in due course. Delaney v. Brownwood, 73 Colo. 83, 213 P. 578
(1923). See McClellan v. Morris, 71 Colo. 304, 206 P. 575 (1922); Am.

prima facie defense, the burden is on the holder to establish by a
preponderance of the evidence that he is a holder in due course. Atkinson v.
Englewood State Bank, 141 Colo. 436, 348 P.2d 702 (1960).</T><P></P>
<T><B>That he is a bona fide holder.</B> Where title is defective the burden of
proof is upon the holder to show that he is a bona fide holder and that he took
the paper before maturity, in good faith and for value. Johnson County Sav.
Bank v. Gregg, 51 Colo. 358, 117 P. 1003 (1911).</T><P></P>
<T><B>Which may be sustained by proof of paying full value and good faith.</B>
Where the burden of showing due course is cast upon the holder, he sustains
that burden by proof of payment of full value and by showing the full
details of the transaction from which there can be no national inference of
knowledge or bad faith on his part. Delaney v. Brownwood, 73 Colo. 83, 213
P. 578 (1923); Omaha Steel Works v. Martin, 78 Colo. 560, 243 P. 619 (1926).</T><P></P>
<T><B>Upon proof of full payment, a presumption of innocence prevails
again</B> as before the proof of defective title, subject, of course, to
refutation by further evidence. This rule is reasonable, for who, with
knowledge that a note was paid or invalid, would buy it at full price?

<T><B>Section determinative of sufficiency of allegations required to state

burdens of proof, it is also determinative of the sufficiency of allegations

delivered to the named payee by the drawer. Weaver v. First Nat'l Bank, 138
Colo. 83, 330 P.2d 142 (1958).</T><P></P>
<T><B>Indorsement allegation implied delivery.</B> In an action upon a negotiable
promissory note by an indorsee, an allegation that the payee indorsed the note
to the indorsee implied a delivery, and it was unnecessary to specifically
allege a delivery. Louisville Coal Mining Co. v. Int'l Trust Co., 18
Colo. App. 345, 71 P. 898 (1903).</T><P></P>
<T><B>Presumption of delivery did not apply where fiduciary relationship.</B> The
general presumption of delivery was overcome by the specific presumption
arising where there was a fiduciary relationship in which case the claimant had
to overcome, by evidence, the presumption of undue influence with which the
transaction was tainted because of the existence of the fiduciary relationship.

<T><B>It is error to require lender to show express authority.</B> A court errs
when it rules that the lender must show, through the corporation's articles,
bylaws, or minutes, express authority for such loans from the corporation or
its board, inasmuch as the application of the doctrine of estoppel has kept
pace with the rapid development of corporate enterprise, so that, while ancient
rules regarding limits upon powers of officers of corporations have not been
abrogated, they are conclusively presumed to have been complied with or
compliance to have been waived by the corporation where justice so requires.

<T><B>Alteration of a promissory note renders it invalid.</B> Farmers State Bank
v. Klein, 159 Colo. 165, 410 P.2d 632 (1966).</T><P></P>
<T><B>Where a promissory note, blank as to the rate of interest</B> and the time
from which interest is to be computed, is subscribed by the maker, as well as
the sureties, and delivered by the maker to the payee, who, without authority
of the sureties, fills the blanks and advances money thereon to the maker, the
alteration is a material one, and, consequently, the instrument is thereby
avoided. Ayres v. Walker, 54 Colo. 571, 131 P. 384
(1913).</T><P></P>
<T><B>Reason for rule.</B> This is an old and wise provision of the law, and the
reason for it is apparent when we consider the absoluteness of custody and
control by the payee or holder and the utter helplessness to prevent an
alteration in the case of the maker in that respect. And so the law has
provided as a penalty, not only of criminal liability, but a forfeiture and
cancellation of the obligation in its entirety. Ayres v. Walker, 54 Colo. 571,
131 P. 384 (1913).</T><P></P>
<T><B>One is estopped as against a H.D.C.</B> One who signs a promissory note with
blank spaces for interest which are subsequently filled in by the payee and
thereafter assigned to a holder in due course without knowledge thereof is
estopped to defend on the ground of alteration. Statton v. Stone, 15 Colo.
App. 237, 61 P. 481 (1900).</T><P></P>
<T><B>An alteration on the face of a note reducing the principal,</B> but made
honestly with the intention of making a proper credit, does not bar recovery on
the note. Whitehead v. Emmerich, 38 Colo. 13, 87 P. 790 (1906).</T><P></P>
<T><B>The contention of claimant that the burden of explaining an alteration</B> of
the date of a note upon which his claim was based was not upon him since the
defendant had not objected on that ground was overruled. Gavin v. Kniffen, 82
Colo. 448, 261 P. 6 (1927).</T><P></P>
<T><B>Defense of alteration must be based on preponderance of evidence.</B> Where
the defense of fraudulent alteration is interposed in an action on a promissory
note, an instruction that the jury can find for the defendant only upon a clear
satisfactory preponderance of the evidence is sufficient. Brunton v. Ditto, 51

The following annotations include cases decided under former provisions
similar to this section.</T><P></P>
<T><B>Acceptance of a bill at common law and under this section is</B> merely the
signification by the drawee of his assent to the order of the drawer. The
legal meaning of an acceptance is that the acceptor engages to pay the
instrument according to the tenor of his acceptance; in other words, it is a
promise to pay. Van Buskirk v. State Bank, 35 Colo. 142, 83 P. 778 (1905).</T><P></P>
<T><B>An agreement in writing to honor a draft is sufficient</B> to create
liability to a bank which in reliance thereon is the assignee for value of the
draft. Posey v. Denver Nat'l Bank, 24 Colo. 199, 49 P. 282 (1897).</T><P></P>
<T><B>A drawer may recover of an acceptor upon a verbal acceptance,</B> whether
the
drawer's funds are in the acceptor's hands upon acceptance or later. Durkee v.
Conklin, 13 Colo. App. 313, 57 P. 486 (1899).</T><P></P>
<T><B>Such acceptance is outside the statute of frauds</B> because it is only a
promise to pay another's funds on his order. Durkee v. Conklin, 13 Colo. App.
313, 57 P. 486 (1899).</T><P></P>
<T><B>Drawee may be estopped by conduct to assert that acceptance was not in
writing.</B> Mumm v. Taylor, 121 Colo. 157, 213 P.2d 836 (1950).</T><P></P>
<T><B>Section applies to checks.</B> Though a check need not be presented for
acceptance in order to render the parties thereto liable, still the check
itself does not operate as an assignment of any part of the fund to the credit
of the drawer with the bank and the drawee bank is not liable to the holder,
unless and until it accepts or certifies the check, and, except as otherwise
provided all provisions applicable to a bill of exchange payable on demand
apply to a check. Consequently, as no contrary provision for the acceptance of
or promise to pay a check has been made, the provision applicable to a bill of
exchange (i.e., draft) that acceptance or certification when made must be in
writing applies also to a check. Van Buskirk v. State Bank, 35 Colo. 142, 83
P. 778 (1905).</T><P></P>
<T><B>Where upon inquiry by correspondent bank as agent of the drawer, the bank
agrees</B> to honor check, such assent constitutes an acceptance; and upon
dishonor, drawer can maintain an action for breach of the agreement.

<T><B>One who by false representations as to the solvency of the maker of a

"without recourse" is liable to an action of deceit and the injured

Camenisch, 21 Colo. App. 79, 121 P. 958 (1912).</T><P></P>
<T><B>Where a bank indorses a note over to its president for collection,</B> but he

the bank is liable as an indorser without further indorsement. Moore v. First

<T><B>Where there is a waiver of protest.</B> By placing one's signature upon a

of protest, he is not entitled to demand and notice, with his ability,
therefore, being governed by this section where he is to pay the holder if the
maker does not. Sproul v. Monteith, 66 Colo. 541, 185 P. 270 (1919).</T><P></P>

<T><B>Liability where estoppel created.</B> While the principle that an indorser
is liable on his warranty is correctly stated, the rule has no application when
an estoppel has been created which would preclude plaintiff from obtaining a

<T><B>Notice to one does not constitute notice to

(a)<M>In this section, the term "indorser" includes a drawer having
the obligation described in section 4-3-414 (d).</M><P N="(b)"></P>
<T>(b)<M>Discharge, under section 4-3-604, of the obligation of
a party to pay an instrument does not discharge the obligation of
an indorser or accommodation party having a right of recourse
against the discharged party.</M></T><P N="(c)"></P>
<T>(c)<M>If a person entitled to enforce an instrument agrees,
with or without consideration, to an extension of the due date of
the obligation of a party to pay the instrument, the extension
discharges an indorser or accommodation party having a right of
recourse against the party whose obligation is extended to the
extent the indorser or accommodation party proves that the
extension caused loss to the indorser or accommodation party with
respect to the right of recourse.</M></T><P N="(d)"></P>
<T>(d)<M>If a person entitled to enforce an instrument agrees,
with or without consideration, to a material modification of the
obligation of a party other than an extension of the due date, the
modification discharges the obligation of an indorser or
accommodation party having a right of recourse against the person
whose obligation is modified to the extent the modification causes
loss to the indorser or accommodation party with respect to the
right of recourse. The loss suffered by the indorser or
accommodation party as a result of the modification is equal to
the amount of the right of recourse unless the person enforcing
the instrument proves that no loss was caused by the modification
or that the loss caused by the modification was an amount less
than the amount of the right of recourse.</M></T><P N="(e)"></P>
<T>(e)<M>If the obligation of a party to pay an instrument is
secured by an interest in collateral and a person entitled to
enforce the instrument impairs the value of the interest in
collateral, the obligation of an indorser or accommodation party
having a right of recourse against the obligor is discharged to
the extent of the impairment. The value of an interest in
collateral is impaired to the extent (i) the value of the interest
is reduced to an amount less than the amount of the right of
recourse of the party asserting discharge, or (ii) the reduction
in value of the interest causes an increase in the amount by which
the amount of the right of recourse exceeds the value of the
interest. The burden of proving impairment is on the party
asserting discharge.</M></T><P N="(f)"></P>
<T>(f)<M>If the obligation of a party is secured by an interest
in collateral not provided by an accommodation party and a person
entitled to enforce the instrument impairs the value of the
interest in collateral, the obligation of any party who is jointly
and severally liable with respect to the secured obligation is
discharged to the extent the impairment causes the party asserting
discharge to pay more than that party would have been obliged to
pay, taking into account rights of contribution, if impairment had
not occurred. If the party asserting discharge is an
accommodation party not entitled to discharge under subsection (e)
of this section, the party is deemed to have a right to
contribution based on joint and several liability rather than a
right to reimbursement. The burden of proving impairment is on
the party asserting discharge.</M></T><P N="(g)"></P>
<T>(g)<M>Under subsection (e) or (f) of this
section, impairing value of an interest in collateral includes (i) failure to obtain
or maintain perfection or recordation of the interest in
collateral, (ii) release of collateral without substitution of
collateral of equal value, (iii) failure to perform a duty to
preserve the value of collateral owed, under article 9 or other
law, to a debtor or surety or other person secondarily liable, or
(iv) failure to comply with applicable law in disposing of
collateral.</M></T><P N="(h)"></P>
<T>(h)<M>An accommodation party is not discharged under
subsection (c), (d), or (e) of this section unless the
person entitled to enforce the instrument knows of the accommodation or
has notice under section 4-3-419 (c) that the instrument was
signed for accommodation.</M></T><P N="(i)"></P>
<T>(i)<M>A party is not discharged under this section if (i) the
party asserting discharge consents to the event or conduct that
is the basis of the discharge, or (ii) the instrument or a
separate agreement of the party provides for waiver of discharge
under this section either specifically or by general language
indicating that parties waive defenses based on suretyship or
impairment of collateral.</M></T></SECTION-TEXT><SOURCE-NOTE><T><B>Source:</B>

The following annotations include cases decided under former provisions

<T><B>A verbal promise, without consideration, to

<T><B>Nor does a request by such an

principal maker becomes insolvent.

<T><B>Also, an extension of time of payment of a
promissory note must be</B> by agreement of the
parties and based upon a valid consideration.
Am. Medical &amp; Dental Ass'n v. Grant,
87 Colo. 183, 285 P. 1099 (1930).</T><P></P>
<T><B>A holder cannot arbitrarily extend time
for payment.</B> Stipulation in a promissory note
that makers and indorsers agree to any extension
of time of payment before, at, or after
maturity does not mean that the holder can
arbitrarily extend the time of payment. Am.
Medical &amp; Dental Ass'n v. Grant, 87
Colo. 183, 285 P. 1099 (1930).</T><P></P>
<T><B>As between the maker and payee of a
note, an agreement to extend</B> the time of
payment until a copy of patent to land can be
obtained is not invalid as an indefinite extension.
Drake v. Pueblo Nat'l Bank, 44 Colo. 49, 96 P. 999 (1908).</T><P></P>
<T><B>Though such does not apply to a surety.</B>
A surety is primarily liable, and one primarily
liable thereunder is not released from liability
by an extension of the time of payment to the
principal maker without the surety's consent.
Only the person who can be released by a
binding agreement extending time is one
"secondarily" liable and as a surety is not
"secondarily", but "primarily", liable, he is
not released by such extension. Hall v. Farmers'
Bank, 74 Colo. 165, 220 P. 237 (1923).</T><P></P>
<T><B>Where the holder of a note obtains control
of property which a surety on the note is
entitled</B> to have applied to the payment of the
note, thereby preventing the surety from
being subrogated to the holder's rights in such
property, the surety is released from liability.
Crosby v. Woodbury, 37 Colo. 1, 89 P. 34 (1906).</T><P></P>
<T><B>Instructions merely stating section must
include interpretation.</B> Where instruction on
impairment of recourse or of collateral is correct
statement of law relative to defendant's
defense, it is error not to include interpretation
of this highly technical statute in
instructions to aid jury in applying statute to
facts of case. Pueblo Bank &amp; Trust Co. v.
McMartin, 31 Colo. App. 546, 506 P.2d 759 (1972).</T><P></P>
<T><B>Subsection (2) (under former law) does not require notification and consent
as a
prerequisite to an express reservation of rights.</B> Although plaintiff
discharged defendants in assumption agreement, it expressly reserved its
rights against them.
Therefore the defendants remained liable on their obligation to
plaintiff. Matthews v. Saleen, 812 P.2d 1186 (Colo. App. 1991).</T><P></P>
<T><B>Failure to object to an increase in risk,</B> the terms of which were never

Bigelow, 855 P.2d 1368 (Colo. 1993).</T><P></P>

"Security procedure" means a procedure established by agreement
of a customer and a receiving bank for the purpose of (i) verifying
that a payment order or communication amending or cancelling
a payment order is that of the customer, or (ii) detecting error in
the transmission or the content of the payment order or communication.
A security procedure may require the use of algorithms or
other codes, identifying words or numbers, encryption, callback
procedures, or similar security devices. Comparison of a signature
on a payment order or communication with an authorized specimen
signature of the customer is not by itself a security procedure.</SECTION-TEXT><SOURCE-NOTE><T><B>Source:</B>

security against unauthorized payment orders, and (ii) the bank
proves that it accepted the payment order in good faith and in
compliance with the security procedure and any written agreement or
instruction of the customer restricting acceptance of payment
orders issued in the name of the customer. The bank is not required to
follow an instruction that violates a written agreement

in a manner affording the bank a reasonable opportunity to act on
it before the payment order is accepted.</M></T><P N="(c)"></P>

known to the bank, including the size, type, and frequency of payment orders
normally issued by the customer to the bank, alternative security procedures
offered to the customer, and security
procedures in general use by customers and receiving banks similarly situated.
A security procedure is deemed to be commercially
reasonable if (i) the security procedure was chosen by the customer
after the bank offered, and the customer refused, a security
procedure that was commercially reasonable for that customer, and

be issued to the beneficiary's bank if the receiving bank
exercises ordinary care in the selection of the intermediary bank.
A receiving bank is not required to follow an instruction of the

other than the beneficiary's bank, acceptance of the
order by the receiving bank obliges the sender to pay the bank the
amount of the sender's order. Payment by the sender is not due
until the execution date of the sender's order. The obligation of

order in compliance with an instruction, as stated in section 4-4.5-302(a)(1),
to route the funds transfer through that intermediary
bank is entitled to receive or retain payment from the sender of
the payment order that it accepted. The first sender in the funds

<T>(b)<M>If the sender and receiving bank are members of a funds-transfer system
that nets obligations multilaterally among participants, the receiving bank
receives final settlement when settlement
is complete in accordance with the rules of the system. The obligation
of the sender to pay the amount of a payment order transmitted through the

account of the beneficiary, the bank is required to notify the beneficiary
only if notice is required by the order. Notice may be

circumstances. If the bank fails to give the required notice, the
bank is obliged to pay interest to the beneficiary on the amount of

relevant cases construing that provision have
been included in the annotations to this section.</T><P></P>
<T><B>Letter of credit not similar to surety contract.</B>
An analogy between a surety contract and a letter of credit is not well
taken. General Ins. Co. of Am. v. City of Colo. Springs, 638 P.2d
752 (Colo. 1981).</T><P></P>
<T><B>But akin to cashier's check.</B>
The letter of credit is closely akin to a cashier's check or other negotiable
instrument issued by a bank. Leney v. Plum Grove Bank, 670 F.2d 878 (10th Cir. 1982).</T><P></P>
<T><B>Effect of letter of credit on issuing bank.</B>
By issuing a letter of credit, the bank substitutes its credit for that
of its customer. Leney v. Plum Grove Bank, 670 F.2d 878 (10th Cir. 1982).</T><P></P>
<T><B>One of the uses of credits</B> is to secure performance of a contract
between a bank's customer and a third party. Hyland Hills Metro.
Park &amp; Recreational Dist. v. McCoy Enters., Inc., 38 Colo. App. 23,
554 P.2d 708 (1976).</T><P></P>
<T><B>Two separate contracts are involved.</B> The bank issuing the letter
of credit is bound by its terms and has no obligation or right to
investigate the performance of the other contract to which the credit
relates. Hyland Hills Metro. Park &amp; Recreational Dist. v. McCoy
Enters., Inc., 38 Colo. App. 23, 554 P.2d 708 (1976).</T><P></P>
<T><B>If printed and written, or typed, provisions of a letter of
credit cannot be reconciled,</B> the written, or typed, provisions prevail.
Hyland Hills Metro. Park &amp; Recreational Dist. v. McCoy Enters.,
Inc., 38 Colo. App. 23, 554 P.2d 708 (1976).</T><P></P>
<T><B>Liability of bank where payment not in accordance with credit terms.</B>
Payment by a bank, if not in accordance with the terms of the credit, would
have rendered the bank liable to the customer. Hyland Hills Metro.
Park &amp; Recreational Dist. v. McCoy Enters., Inc., 38 Colo. App. 23,
554 P.2d 708 (1976).</T><P></P>
<T><B>Forum for suing out-of-state issuing bank limited.</B>
It is unfair to burden an out-of-state issuing bank with having to defend
litigation over a letter of credit in any state in which the bank could
reasonably expect the credit to be used. Leney v. Plum Grove Bank, 670
F.2d 878 (10th Cir. 1982).</T><P></P>
<T><B>Bank's obligation held terminated.</B> Where a third party was
seeking payment under the letter of credit because of the bank
customer's failure to construct the tennis courts, it was required
to present its "signed statement dated January 5, 1974, and presented
on that date", setting forth that fact according to the terms of the
letter of credit. Upon its failure to do so, the obligation of the
bank terminated. Hyland Hills Metro. Park &amp; Recreational Dist.
v. McCoy Enters., Inc., 38 Colo. App. 23, 554 P.2d 708 (1976).</T><P></P>
<T><B>"Guaranty letter of credit"</B> issued by a bank requiring
a documentary demand, and conspicuously stating that it was
a letter of credit, falls squarely within the definition of
letter of credit so that a defendant bank cannot escape its
obligation to honor a demand on it. East Bank v. Dovenmuehle,
Inc., 196 Colo. 422, 589 P.2d 1361 (1978).</T><P></P>

prohibited in sections 4-1-302 and 4-5-117 (d), the effect of this article may be varied by
agreement or by a provision stated or incorporated by reference in an undertaking. A term

dishonors or repudiates its obligation to pay money under a letter of credit
before presentation, the beneficiary, successor, or nominated
person presenting on its own behalf may recover from the issuer
the amount that is the subject of the dishonor or repudiation.
If the issuer's obligation under the letter of credit is not for
the payment of money, the claimant may obtain specific performance
or, at the claimant's election, recover an amount equal to the
value of performance from the issuer. In either case, the
claimant may also recover incidental but not consequential
damages. The claimant is not obligated to take action to avoid
damages that might be due from the issuer under this subsection
(a). If, although not obligated to do so, the claimant avoids
damages, the claimant's recovery from the issuer must be reduced
by the amount of damages avoided. The issuer has the burden of
proving the amount of damages avoided. In the case of repudiation
the claimant need not present any document.</M><P N="(b)"></P>

of the breach.</M></T><P N="(c)"></P>

breaches an obligation not covered in subsection (a) or (b) of

damages resulting from the breach, including incidental but not
consequential damages, less any amount saved as a result of the
breach. To the extent of the confirmation, a confirmer has the

<T><B>And contract principles may be considered in deciding

forged or fraudulent or that there is fraud in the transaction; the issuer
may, however, be enjoined from honoring such drafts or demands for payment.

Comm'rs, 634 P.2d 32 (Colo. 1981).</T><P></P>
<T><B>When issuer confined to stated grounds for dishonor.</B>
An issuer is confined to its stated grounds for dishonor where the statements
have misled the beneficiary who could have cured the defect but relied on
the stated grounds to its injury. Colo. Nat'l Bank v. Bd. of County
Comm'rs, 634 P.2d 32 (Colo. 1981).</T><P></P>
<T><B>Waiver of grounds for refusal to pay.</B> In cases involving letters

<T><B>Measure of damages.</B> Where household goods, wearing apparel,
and personal effects of a bailor have a market value, then the measure
of damages for negligent harm to personal property bailed with a
warehouseman is the difference between the fair market value of the
goods at the time the injury was discovered and what would have been
the fair market value at that time if the goods had not been damaged.
Keefe v. Bekins Van &amp; Storage Co., 36 Colo. App. 382, 540 P.2d 1132 (1975).</T><P></P>
<T>Original costs of goods which were damaged while in possession
of a warehouseman may be considered in determining market value, but
only if combined with other factors such as the length of time the
property has been used, its condition just before, and its salvage
value after the damage occurred.

<T>Where an item, while in the possession of a warehouseman, is

<T>Where articles which have been damaged while in the possession
of a warehouseman have no market value in the ordinary sense, they may
be given a reasonable value on the basis of their value to the owner,
and for this purpose, original cost and the practicability and expense
of replacement can be considered.

C. 173, § 21 (uniform warehouse receipts act), relevant cases construing
those provisions have been included in the annotations to this section.</T><P></P>
<T><B>The legal relationship created in warehousing is that of
bailor-bailee.</B> Burroughs Corp. v. Rocky Mt. Prestress, Inc., 431
F.2d 1185 (10th Cir. 1970).</T><P></P>
<T><B>Bound only to common care.</B> It is well
settled that warehousemen are not like common carriers, insurers of goods
committed to their care and liable for all losses not occasioned by the act
of God or a public enemy, but are ordinary bailees for hire, bound only to
common care and diligence and liable only for want of such diligence and
care. Benedict Whse. &amp; Transf. Co. v. McKannon Piano Co., 62 Colo. 180,
161 P. 145 (1916).</T><P></P>
<T><B>Warehousemen are liable for loss due to their negligence.</B> See Denver
Union Term. Ry. v. Cullinan, 72 Colo. 248, 210 P. 602 (1922).</T><P></P>
<T><B>When there is substantial evidence upon the issue, the question of
reasonable care is for the jury,</B> in view of all the surrounding
circumstances. Benedict Whse. &amp; Transf. Co. v. McKannon Piano Co., 62
Colo. 180, 161 P. 145 (1916).</T><P></P>
<T><B>In the absence of evidence, the question of reasonable care is for the
court.</B> Benedict Whse. &amp; Transf. Co. v. McKannon Piano Co., 62 Colo. 180,
161
P. 145 (1916).</T><P></P>
<T><B>Appellate court must accept trier of fact's conclusion.</B> The
issues of negligence and proximate cause are to be resolved by the trier of
the fact, and upon review the appellate court must view the evidence in the
light most favorable to the party in whose favor the trier of the fact
resolved the inferences to be drawn from the evidence. Hipps v. Hennig,
167 Colo. 358, 447 P.2d 700 (1968).</T><P></P>
<T><B>An appellate court can reach a conclusion of what constitutes reasonable
care or proximate cause different from the one reached by the trier of the
fact,</B> only in the clearest cases where the facts are undisputed and
reasonable minds could draw but one inference from them. Hipps v. Hennig, 167
Colo. 358, 447 P.2d 700 (1968).</T><P></P>
<T><B>It cannot be said that a warehouseman is required to foresee,
as a matter of law, that the distribution of keys to other tenants or users
of the building could result in a fire</B> being set. Hipps v. Hennig, 167
Colo. 358, 447 P.2d 700 (1968).</T><P></P>
<T><B>It cannot be said that as a matter of law all warehousemen must employ
a night watchman or put in an automatic sprinkler system,</B> and that the
failure to do so subjects the warehouseman to liability for any fire which
occurs on the premises. Hipps v. Hennig, 167 Colo. 358, 447 P.2d 700 (1968).</T><P></P>
<T><B>To establish a prima facie case the bailor need only show</B> that the
goods were delivered to the bailee in good condition and that the bailee
returned the goods in a damaged condition. Burroughs Corp. v. Rocky Mt.
Prestress, Inc., 431 F.2d 1185 (10th Cir. 1970).
See Bankers Whse. Co. v. Bennett, 148 Colo. 323, 365 P.2d 889 (1961).</T><P></P>
<T><B>As a presumption of negligence arises.</B> Once goods are delivered in
good condition to a warehouseman who accepts them, but cannot redeliver
them, or can redeliver them only in a damaged condition, a presumption of
negligence on the part of the warehouseman arises. Hipps v. Hennig, 167
Colo. 358, 447 P.2d 700 (1968); Burroughs Corp. v. Rocky
Mt. Prestress, Inc., 431 F.2d 1185 (10th Cir. 1970).</T><P></P>
<T>Where in February 1973, a warehouseman accepted the bailor's
goods for storage and redelivered them in September, 1973, in a
water-damaged condition, under these circumstances a presumption of
negligence on the part of the warehouseman arose.
Keefe v. Bekins Van &amp; Storage Co., 36 Colo. App. 382, 540 P.2d 1132 (1975).</T><P></P>
<T><B>The burden of going forward with evidence to rebut that presumption
rests on the warehouseman.</B> Bankers Whse. Co. v. Bennett, 148 Colo. 323,
365 P.2d 889 (1961); Hipps v. Hennig, 167 Colo. 358, 447 P.2d 700 (1968);
Burroughs Corp. v. Rocky Mt. Prestress, Inc., 431 F.2d
1185 (10th Cir. 1970); Keefe v. Bekins Van &amp; Storage Co., 36 Colo. App.
382, 540 P.2d 1132 (1975).</T><P></P>
<T><B>Once the bailor has established these facts, it is incumbent on the
bailee to come forward with evidence to show</B> that the goods were returned
in good condition, or that there exists some acceptable explanation as to
why they were returned in a damaged condition. Burroughs Corp. v. Rocky
Mt. Prestress, Inc., 431 F.2d 1185 (10th Cir. 1970).</T><P></P>
<T><B>The effect of this rule requiring the bailee to meet the presumption of
negligence is</B> to place the burden upon the one best able to discharge it.
Bankers Whse. Co. v. Bennett, 148 Colo. 323, 365 P.2d 889 (1961).</T><P></P>
<T><B>An essential part of every bailment contract is the obligation to
deliver over</B> the property at the termination of the bailment. The bailor
must prove the contract, the delivery of the goods to the bailee, and their
return in a damaged condition. When he has done this, the inference is
deducible that the bailee is at fault and must answer, and especially is this
true if the loss could not ordinarily have occurred without negligence.
His failure to return the goods as delivered to him is inconsistent with
what he agreed to do. The property was in his possession, under his care
and oversight, and away from that of the bailor, who in most cases could
not know under what circumstances it was damaged. Bankers Whse. Co. v.
Bennett, 148 Colo. 323, 365 P.2d 889 (1961).</T><P></P>
<T><B>There is, however, no shift in the burden of proof</B> which still
remains with the bailor. Hipps v. Hennig, 167 Colo. 358, 447 P.2d 700 (1968);
Burroughs Corp. v. Rocky Mt. Prestress, Inc., 431
F.2d 1185 (10th Cir. 1970).</T><P></P>
<T><B>Where foodstuffs are received by a warehouse in good marketable
condition but are later contaminated while in storage,</B> the question is,
whether the warehouseman, if he had been the owner engaged in the sale,
storage, and distribution of such would permit them to be stored with or
come in contact with anything which would impregnate them with an odor,
inasmuch as one engaged in such a business as storage of foodstuffs would
presumably know of their susceptibility to absorb or acquire the taste and
odor of other substances and take measures to guard against resulting
contamination. Bankers Whse. Co. v. Bennett, 148 Colo. 323, 365 P.2d 889

the warehouse also has a lien against the goods covered by the warehouse receipt or storage

(a)<M>Except as otherwise provided in subsection (b) of this section, a warehouse's lien
may be enforced by public or private sale of the goods, in bulk or in packages, at any time
or place and on any terms that are commercially reasonable, after notifying all persons
known to claim an interest in the goods. The notification must include a statement of the
amount due, the nature of the proposed sale, and the time and place of any public sale. The
fact that a better price could have been obtained by a sale at a different time or in a method
different from that selected by the warehouse is not of itself sufficient to establish that the
sale was not made in a commercially reasonable manner. The warehouse sells in a
commercially reasonable manner if the warehouse sells the goods in the usual manner in any
recognized market therefore, sells at the price current in that market at the time of the sale,
or otherwise sells in conformity with commercially reasonable practices among dealers in
the type of goods sold. A sale of more goods than apparently necessary to be offered to
ensure satisfaction of the obligation is not commercially reasonable, except in cases covered
by the preceding sentence.</M><P N="(b)"></P>
<T>(b)<M>A warehouse may enforce its lien on goods, other than goods stored by a
merchant in the course of its business, only if the following requirements are satisfied:</M></T><P N="(b)(1)"></P>
<T>(1)<M>All persons known to claim an interest in the goods are notified.</M></T><P N="(b)(2)"></P>
<T>(2)<M>The notification includes an itemized statement of the claim, a description of the
goods subject to the lien, a demand for payment within a specified time not less than ten
days after receipt of the notification, and a conspicuous statement that unless the claim is
paid within that time, the goods will be advertised for sale and sold by auction at a specified
time and place.</M></T><P N="(b)(3)"></P>

<T>(4)<M>The sale is held at the nearest suitable place to where the goods are held or
stored.</M></T><P N="(b)(5)"></P>
<T>(5)<M>After the expiration of the time given in the notification, an advertisement of
the sale must be published once a week for two weeks consecutively in a newspaper of
general circulation where the sale is to be held. The advertisement must include a
description of the goods, the name of the person on whose account the goods are being held,
and the time and place of the sale. The sale must take place at least fifteen days after the first
publication. If there is no newspaper of general circulation where the sale is to be held, the
advertisement must be posted at least ten days before the sale in not fewer than six
conspicuous places in the neighborhood of the proposed sale.</M></T><P N="(c)"></P>
<T>(c)<M>Before any sale held pursuant to this section, any person claiming a right in the
goods may pay the amount necessary to satisfy the lien and the reasonable expenses incurred
in complying with this section. In that event, the goods may not be sold but must be retained
by the warehouse subject to the terms of the receipt and this article.</M></T><P N="(d)"></P>

(a)<M>A consignee of a nonnegotiable bill of lading which has given value in good faith,
or a holder to which a negotiable bill has been duly negotiated, relying upon the description
of the goods in the bill or upon the date shown in the bill, may recover from the issuer
damages caused by the misdating of the bill or the nonreceipt or misdescription of the goods,
except to the extent that the bill indicates that the issuer does not know whether any part or
all of the goods in fact were received or conform to the description, such as in a case in
which the description is in terms of marks or labels or kind, quantity, or condition or the
receipt or description is qualified by "contents or condition of contents of packages
unknown", "said to contain", "shipper's weight, load, and count", or words of similar import,
if that indication is true.</M><P N="(b)"></P>

<T>(c)<M>If bulk goods are loaded by a shipper that makes available to the issuer of a bill
of lading adequate facilities for weighing those goods, the issuer shall ascertain the kind and
quantity within a reasonable time after receiving the shipper's request in a record to do so.
In that case, "shipper's weight" or words of similar import are ineffective.</M></T><P N="(d)"></P>
<T>(d)<M>The issuer of a bill of lading, by including in the bill the words "shipper's
weight, load, and count" or words of similar import, may indicate that the goods were loaded
by the shipper, and, if that statement is true, the issuer is not liable for damages caused by
the improper loading. However, omission of such words does not imply liability for
damages caused by improper loading.</M></T><P N="(e)"></P>
<T>(e)<M>A shipper guarantees to an issuer the accuracy at the time of shipment of the
description, marks, labels, number, kind, quantity, condition, and weight, as furnished by the
shipper, and the shipper shall indemnify the issuer against damage caused by inaccuracies
in those particulars. This right of indemnity does not limit the issuer's responsibility or
liability under the contract of carriage to any person other than the shipper.</M></T></SECTION-TEXT><SOURCE-NOTE><T><B>Source:</B>

<T><B>Release of goods to dealer as defense.</B> In action for conversion of
goods stored by plaintiff with named defendant, if the plaintiff either
instructed defendant to receive and store the goods for a dealer or
delivered them under such circumstances as to give defendant reasonable
ground to believe that plaintiff intended that the goods be held for the
dealer, and defendant released said goods to the dealer, in good faith,
without knowledge or information that plaintiff intended to hold the goods
until payment by dealer, such constitutes a defense to plaintiff's action;
but defendant warehouseman, having admitted the receipt of goods from
plaintiff in the usual course of its warehouse business, the burden of
going forward with the evidence is on defendant to justify delivery to one
other than plaintiff. Wheelock Bros. v. Bankers Whse. Co., 115 Colo. 197,

<T>Absent unusual circumstances, a simple breach of contract does not itself establish a

<T>Unusual circumstances entitled claimant to equitable remedies where seller of bond
did more than simply breach a contract. Seller acted in a fraudulent manner intended to
hinder and defraud the rights of the claimant. In addition, the bond was not a fungible
investment security but rather was created as part of a land development project and

<T><B>Section does not protect those with actual notice.</B>
The purpose of this section was to make ineffective restrictions on

<T><B>Those on inquiry notice not denied protection of section.</B>
This section clearly placed the duty on the issuer to note the restriction
conspicuously on the certificate, not on the bank to inquire. And
the statute's protection was extended to all against an unnoted restriction
except those with "actual knowledge of it". Those who are only on inquiry
notice are not denied protection by the code. Edina State Bank v. Mr. Steak,

<T><B>Bank as pledgee was among the persons protected generally by

<T><B>Federal securities act does not override section.</B>
The absence of a requirement for a notation of the restriction in the
federal securities act does not override this section under the doctrine
of preemption. This important provision of the code may be read
in harmony with the federal statute. Both regulations can be enforced
without impairing federal superintendence of the field and thus the
state statute need not give way. The securities act shows no intent
to prevent such significant regulation by state law. Edina State Bank v.
Mr. Steak, Inc., 487 F.2d 640 (10th Cir. 1973), cert. denied, 419 U.S.

<T><B>Bank's right to damages not defeated by federal statute.</B>
The prohibition of the federal statute against carrying out transfers
of unregistered stock did not defeat the bank's right to damages under this
section. The court did not have to decide whether the bank as a bona fide
pledgee could enforce specifically the transfer of the collateral to
the purchaser. The only question was whether the bank was entitled to damages
when the issuer asserted its own restriction which was not conspicuously noted
on its stock certificate as a ground for refusing to register a transfer.
In these circumstances the bank was entitled to damages for its loss and the
recovery of them was not violative of the federal prohibition against transfer.

<T><B>Annotator's note.</B>
Since § 4-9-102 is similar to §§ 4-9-105, 4-9-106, 4-9-301, and 4-9-306
as
they existed prior to the 2001 repeal and reenactment of this article, relevant cases
construing
those provisions have been included in the annotations to this section.</T><P></P>
<T><B>A debtor who makes representations in a security agreement regarding the
intended use of collateral should be bound by those representations.</B> That is
especially true where the debtors fail to inform the creditor that they intend to use the
collateral for other than personal, family, or household purposes. The classification of
the collateral, for purposes of perfection of the security interest, is determined when the
security interest attaches. The later use of the collateral for another purpose than as
stated in the security agreement is irrelevant in determining whether the security interest
is perfected. Nelson v. John Deere Credit, 340 B.R. 86 (Bankr. D. Colo. 2006).</T><P></P>
<T><B>Bank has security interest in proceeds generating "account".</B>
A bank has no security interest in the proceeds of either chickens or eggs, except to the
extent such proceeds generated a prepetition "account" as defined in this section. K.L.
Smith
Enters., Ltd. v. United Bank, 2 B.R. 280 (Bankr. D. Colo. 1980).</T><P></P>
<T><B>"General intangible" does not include "a thing in action" to recover from an
"account".</B> Millennium Bank v. UPS Capital Bus. Credit, 2014 COA 30, 327 P.3d
335.</T><P></P>
<T><B>Whether recovery from a lawsuit is categorized as proceeds of an "account" or a
"general intangible"</B> depends on the nature of the claim for which the damages are
awarded. Arbitration award for a breach of an express warranty related to excess costs in
labor and materials is a "general intangible", and the award is not attributable to an
unrelated contractual relationship the debtor had with another party. Millennium Bank v.
UPS Capital Bus. Credit, 2014 COA 30, 327 P.3d 335.</T><P></P>
<T><B>The right to collect annual campground membership dues is a right to payment
for
services rendered,</B>
which is an ordinary commercial account receivable. If the security interest is in
accounts,
the law of the jurisdiction in which the debtor is located governs the perfection and the
effect
of perfection or nonperfection of the security interest. Therefore, since the debtor was
located at its place of business in Florida, Florida was the proper jurisdiction in which to
file
in order to perfect a security interest in the collateral, making the location of the collateral
in Colorado irrelevant. Capitran Inc. v. Great W. Bank, 872 P.2d 1370 (Colo. App.
1994).</T><P></P>
<T><B>"Debtor" construed.</B>
Accommodation comakers and those others who will be called upon to pay deficiencies
are
"debtors" within the meaning of subsection (1)(d) and § 4-9-504 (3), and are
entitled
to notice of the disposition of the collateral. First Nat'l Bank v. Cillessen, 622 P.2d 598
(Colo. App. 1980).</T><P></P>
<T>"Debtor" includes both the owner of the collateral and the obligor when they are not
the
same person. First Nat'l Bank v. Cillessen, 622 P.2d 598 (Colo. App. 1980).</T><P></P>
<T><B>Subsection (1)(d) does not require "debtor" to be owner</B> or have rights in
the
collateral. First Nat'l Bank v. Cillessen, 622 P.2d 598 (Colo. App. 1980).</T><P></P>
<T><B>"Debtor" includes a guarantor</B>
and as a debtor the guarantor may not waive debtor's right to insist on a commercially
reasonable disposition of collateral. May v. Women's Bank, N.A., 807 P.2d 1145 (Colo.
1991).</T><P></P>
<T><B>Definition of "goods" includes motor homes.</B>
People ex rel. VanMeveren v. District Court, 619 P.2d 494 (Colo. 1980).</T><P></P>
<T><B>An unperfected security interest becomes subordinate to the rights acquired by a
lien
creditor</B> when a writ of garnishment is served on the garnishee at a time when the
garnishor has no notice of the security interest. Welbourne Dev. Co. v. Affiliated
Clearance
Corp., 28 Colo. App. 313, 472 P.2d 684 (1970).</T><P></P>
<T><B>For the inconsistency between § 4-9-203 and this section on subject of
proceeds,</B> see Fort Collins Prod. Credit Ass'n v. Carroll Dairy, 37 Colo. App. 536,
553
P.2d 95 (1976) (decided prior to the 1977 amendment of this section and §
4-9-203).</T><P></P>
<T><B>Nothing in the language of subsection (1) requires that the disposition of
collateral
must be final in order to generate proceeds.</B> In re Clancy &amp; Co. Const., Inc.,
214
B.R. 387 (Bankr. D. Colo. 1997).</T><P></P>
<T><B>Effect of failure to use word "proceeds" in security agreement.</B>
Even absent use of the specific word "proceeds" in a security agreement, the lender
continues, under the uniform commercial code, to have a secured interest in money
received
from the sale of personalty covered specifically in the agreement. Fort Collins Prod.
Credit
Ass'n v. Carroll Dairy, 37 Colo. App. 536, 553 P.2d 95 (1976).</T><P></P>
<T><B>Cattle which eat feed in which there is a security interest do not constitute
proceeds</B> of the collateral by application of this section. First Nat'l Bank v. Bostron,
39
Colo. App. 107, 564 P.2d 964 (1977).</T><P></P>
<T>There could be no traceable "proceeds" to which a security interest in cattle feed may
be said to have attached when the cattle have consumed the feed, and therefore such a
security interest could not survive consumption of the feed by the cattle. First Nat'l Bank
v.
Bostron, 37 Colo. App. 107, 564 P.2d 964 (1977).</T><P></P>
<T><B>Wool incentive payments are "proceeds" of the wool.</B> In re Mahleres, 53
B.R.
86 (Bankr. D. Colo. 1985).</T><P></P>
<T><B>Satisfaction of judgment constituted only "identifiable proceeds in the hands of
the
debtor",</B> when the debtor paid to judgment creditor the cash proceeds of sale of
equipment in which bank held security interest, and thus bank in enforcing its security
interest in identifiable proceeds of sale was not entitled to recover from judgment
creditor
the amount paid by debtor. First Interstate Bank v. Ariz. Agrochemical, 731 P.2d 746

<T><B>Security interest in automobiles do not attach until title certificates are delivered

but
before the certificates of title were transferred to a bank as the purchaser's agent, the
purchaser executed a security agreement with the bank, intending to create a security
interest in the automobiles to secure repayment of the bank's financing loan, until the
certificates
of title were properly transferred to the purchaser's agent, no right, title, or interest was
created in the purchaser which would enable it to legally convey or encumber the
automobiles.
Therefore, although the bank and purchaser fully intended that the security interest attach
to the automobiles at the time the loan funds were deposited in the purchaser's account,
the
absence of any legal right, title, or interest by the purchaser in the automobiles prevented
the bank's security interest from attaching prior to the time that the certificates of title
were
delivered. Guy Martin Buick, Inc. v. Colo. Springs Nat'l Bank, 184 Colo. 166, 519

<T><B>Security interest may attach to accounts receivable of public contractor.</B> A
bank's security interest in the accounts receivable of a public contractor is valid only
insofar
as the contractor has rights to the funds retained by the public body to ensure the
payment
of any claims against the contractor. Where a supplier files a notice of claim with the
public
body, the contractor has no rights to these funds until this claim is settled. Thus, the
security
interest does not attach to these funds. Heinrichsdorff v. Raat, 655 P.2d 860 (Colo. App.
1982).</T><P></P>
<T><B>Right of reformation due to mutual mistake not displaced by this section in cases

possession
of the gravel once it is extracted. Palmer v. Corey (In re Musick Constr., Inc.), 34 B.R.

<T>After the purchaser of some automobiles delivered its check to the seller, but before
the certificates of title were transferred to a bank as the purchaser's agent, the purchaser
executed a security agreement with the bank, intending to create a security interest in the
automobiles to secure repayment of the bank's financing loan, until the certificates of title
were properly transferred to the purchaser's agent, no right, title, or interest was created
in
the purchaser which would enable it to legally convey or encumber the automobiles.
Therefore, although the bank and purchaser fully intended that the security interest attach
to
the automobiles at the time the loan funds were deposited in the purchaser's account, the
absence of any legal right, title, or interest by the purchaser in the automobiles prevented
the
bank's security interest from attaching prior to the time that the certificates of title were

section except to the extent that motor vehicle titles are governed</B> by §
42-6-131,

precluded
from the application of the provisions of § 4-9-103(3). Doenges-Glass, Inc. v.

<T><B>Issuance of title certificate to repossessor involves no deprivation of due

that repossession of automobiles or any other property sold on time payment with an

<T><B>Presumption that proceeds from sale without notice equal balance owing.</B>
Where there is no notice prior to sale of collateral, it is rebuttably presumed that the value
of the collateral sold is equal to the balance owing on any notes. To rebut the
presumption,
the secured party has the burden of proving, by other evidence, that the market value of
the
collateral and that, after application of that amount, there was a balance still owing on the
notes. United Bank v. Reed, 635 P.2d 922 (Colo. App. 1981); Gapter v. Kocjancic, 703

<T><B>The reason for exempting from the notice requirement a transaction where there

<T><B>Director of revenue not involved in repossession and transfer of ownership.</B>
The activity of the director of revenue in the issuance of a new title to a repossessor of a
motor vehicle is strictly limited to the ministerial duty of providing prima facie evidence
of
what has already occurred by purely private action, namely, the transfer of title from the
debtor to the creditor in a manner specifically provided for by their agreement. It does
not
in any meaningful way involve the director in the repossession and subsequent transfer of
ownership to the repossessor. Sifuentes v. Weed, 186 Colo. 109, 525 P.2d 1157 (1974).</T><P></P>
<T><B>Sufficient evidence that notice sent.</B> The existence of a business custom is

decide
if that presumption is overcome by other evidence. Greeley Nat. Bank v. Sloan, 677 P.2d

<T><B>Amount received at sale is not evidence of market value if sale is not conducted

compliance with the law, the amount received is not evidence of the market value, and
the
secured party has to prove value by other evidence. First Nat'l Bank v. Cillessen, 622
P.2d
598 (Colo. App. 1980).</T><P></P>
<T><B>Debtor entitled to market value offset against balance due.</B> The debtors are

against
any balance due on the indebtedness. First Nat'l Bank v. Cillessen, 622 P.2d 598 (Colo.
App. 1980).</T><P></P>
<T><B>Evidence of purchaser's lack of good faith.</B> Knowledge that the holder of a

be
evidence of a want of good faith on the part of a purchaser. Young v. Golden State

39 Colo. App. 45, 560 P.2d 855 (1977).</T><P></P>
<T><B>"Debtor" construed.</B> Accommodation comakers and those others who will
be
called upon to pay deficiencies are "debtors" within the meaning of § 4-9-105 (1)(d)
and subsection (3) of this section, and are entitled to notice of the disposition of the
collateral. First Nat'l Bank v. Cillessen, 622 P.2d 598 (Colo. App. 1980).</T><P></P>
