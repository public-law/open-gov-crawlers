        <p>The following terminology frequently appears in the literature concerning parental alienation syndrome. It is
          used in this paper to help ensure an accurate representation of sources.</p>
        <dl>
          <dt>Alienated Parent:</dt>
          <dd>The alienated parent is the parent whose relationship with the child is undermined or obstructed (i.e. the
            target of alienating behaviour).</dd>
          <dt>Alienating Parent:</dt>
          <dd>The alienating parent is the parent engaging in behaviour that undermines or obstructs the child's
            relationship with the other parent. This parent may also be referred to as the alienator.</dd>
          <dt>Allegations:</dt>
          <dd>Typically one parent makes allegations about the behaviour of the other parent. Children may also make
            allegations. <em>Unsubstantiated</em> allegations are those in which there is suspicion but insufficient
            evidence to conclude the allegation is true. When there is no evidence to support the allegation, it is
            considered <em>unfounded</em>. When the evidence supports the allegation it is <em>founded</em>.</dd>
          <dt>Contact:</dt>
          <dd>Contact refers to time the child spends with a parent after separation or divorce.</dd>
          <dt>Contact Difficulties:</dt>
          <dd>The term contact difficulties refers to a complex set of circumstances that negatively affects the
            child-parent relationship, whether originating with the residential parent, non-residential parent, child,
            or a combination of two or more of these people.</dd>
          <dt>Daubert v. Merrill Pharmaceuticals:</dt>
          <dd>Zirogiannis (2001) states that there is no universally recognized standard for assessing the reliability
            and validity of expert social science evidence. Nevertheless, three American cases are frequently referred
            to in the literature concerning parental alienation syndrome: Frye v. United States, Daubert v. Merrill
            Pharmaceuticals, and Kumho Tire v. Carmichael. In Frye v. United States, scientific evidence was considered
            admissible if it was based on generally accepted professional standards. This has come to be referred to as
            the general-acceptance standard for evidence. Subsequently, in Daubert v. Merrill Pharmaceuticals, the
            judges were viewed as having gate-keeping responsibilities with respect to the admissibility of evidence
            based on a four-step test. Non-binding considerations for judges were suggested in this Daubert decision.
            This is referred to as the multiple-factor test. The United States Supreme Court
            addressed questions related to expert evidence in Kumho Tire v. Carmichael. The Court concluded that judges
            have considerable discretion to determine reliability and validity. Zirogiannis states that this decision
            permits the introduction of novel expert analysis. Refer to Zirogiannis (2001) for a more detailed
            explanation of evidentiary issues for the introduction of expert evidence.</dd>
          <dt>Department of Justice: 2001 Consultation Process:</dt>
          <dd>At the request of the Federal/Provincial/Territorial Family Law Committee, IER (a private consulting firm)
            conducted a countrywide consultation process in Spring 2001. This consultation involved parenting plan
            issues as well as a review of aspects of the child support guidelines. The consultation report is available
            from the Department of Justice and authorship is attributed to IER.</dd>
          <dt><span lang="fr">folie &#224; deux</span>:</dt>
          <dd>Ellis (2000: 218) identifies a similarity between <span lang="fr">folie &#224; deux</span> and PAS. She
            states:

            <blockquote>
              <p> ... the core feature of <span lang="fr">folie &#224; deux</span> is that a delusion develops in one
                person who is involved in a close relationship with another person who already has a delusional
                disorder. The primary individual is dominant in the relationship and gradually imposes his or her
                delusional system on the more passive and initially healthy second person. These individuals are usually
                related by blood ties or by marriage and have lived together for a long time, often in isolation. The
                most common dyads are husband to wife, sister to sister, and parent to children. </p>
            </blockquote>
          </dd>

          <dt>Frye v. United States:</dt>
          <dd>Zirogiannis (2001) states that there is no universally recognized standard for assessing the reliability
            and validity of expert social science evidence. Nevertheless, three American cases are frequently referred
            to in the literature concerning parental alienation syndrome: Frye v. United States, Daubert v. Merrill
            Pharmaceuticals, and Kumho Tire v. Carmichael. In Frye v. United States, scientific evidence was considered
            admissible if it was based on generally accepted professional standards. This has come to be referred to as
            the general-acceptance standard for evidence. Subsequently, in Daubert v. Merrill Pharmaceuticals, the
            judges were viewed as having gate-keeping responsibilities with respect to the admissibility of evidence
            based on a four-step test. Non-binding considerations for judges were suggested in this Daubert decision.
            This is referred to as the multiple-factor test. The United States Supreme Court addressed questions
            related to expert evidence in Kumho Tire v. Carmichael. The Court concluded that judges have considerable
            discretion to determine reliability and validity. Zirogiannis states that this decision permits the
            introduction of novel expert analysis. Refer to Zirogiannis (2001) for a more detailed explanation of
            evidentiary issues for the introduction of expert evidence.</dd>
          <dt>High-conflict Manager:</dt>
          <dd>Same as Parenting Coordinator. Baris et al. (2001: 10) use the term parenting coordinator (PC)as a generic
            or umbrella term. They state <q>&quot;By Parenting Coordinator, we mean an individual assigned by the court
              or by stipulation through the court whose task is to educate, mediate, and perhaps arbitrate parental
              disputes over the raising of their children.&quot;</q> They also employ the term <q>&quot;high-conflict
              manager&quot;</q>. In some jurisdictions, such professionals are referred to as special masters or special
            advocates.</dd>
          <dt>Kumho Tire v. Carmichael:</dt>
          <dd>Zirogiannis (2001) states that there is no universally recognized standard for assessing the reliability
            and validity of expert social science evidence. Nevertheless, three American cases are frequently referred
            to in the literature concerning parental alienation syndrome: Frye v. United States, Daubert v. Merrill

            the introduction of novel expert analysis. Refer to Zirogiannis (2001) for a more detailed explanation of
            evidentiary issues for the introduction of expert evidence.</dd>
          <dt>Modified Contact:</dt>
          <dd>Modified contact refers to indirect child-parent contact. Examples of indirect means of contact include
            e-mail and letters or cards.</dd>
          <dt>Non-Residential Parent:</dt>
          <dd>The parent with whom the child does not normally live. This may or may not be the parent who has
            decision-making responsibility.</dd>
          <dt>Parenting Coordinator:</dt>
          <dd>Baris et al. (2001: 10) use the term parenting coordinator (PC)as a generic or umbrella term. They state
            <q>&quot;By Parenting Coordinator, we mean an individual assigned by the court or by stipulation through the
              court whose task is to educate, mediate and perhaps arbitrate parental disputes over the raising of their
              children&quot;</q>. They also employ the term <q>&quot;high-conflict manager&quot;</q>. In some
            jurisdictions, such professionals are referred to as special masters or special advocates.</dd>
          <dt>Rejected Parent:</dt>
          <dd>The rejected parent is the parent whose relationship with the child is undermined or obstructed (i.e. the
            target of alienating behaviour).</dd>
          <dt>Residential Parent:</dt>
          <dd>The parent with whom the child primarily resides. This may or may not be the parent who has
            decision-making responsibility.</dd>
          <dt>Special Joint Parliamentary Committee on Child Custody and Access:</dt>
          <dd>This committee was comprised of twenty-three members from both Houses of Parliament during the 36th
            Parliament (1st Session). The Committee heard evidence from government officials, legal and mental health
            practitioners, parents and children. Their report, For the Sake of the Children, was tabled in parliament on
            December 10, 1998.</dd>
          <dt>Special Master:</dt>
          <dd>Similar to Parenting Coordinator. Baris et al. (2001: 10) use the term parenting coordinator (PC)as a
            generic or umbrella term. They state <q>&quot;By Parenting Coordinator, we mean an individual assigned by
              the court or by stipulation through the court whose task is to educate, mediate, and perhaps arbitrate
              parental disputes over the raising of their children.&quot;</q> They also employ the term
            <q>&quot;high-conflict manager.&quot;</q> In some jurisdictions, such professionals are referred to as
            special masters or special advocates.</dd>
          <dt>Standard for Expert Social Science Testimony:</dt>
          <dd>Zirogiannis (2001) states that there is no universally recognized standard for assessing the reliability
            and validity of expert social science evidence. Nevertheless, three American cases are frequently referred
            to in the literature concerning parental alienation syndrome: Frye v. United States, Daubert v. Merrill
            Pharmaceuticals, and Kumho Tire v. Carmichael. In Frye v. United States, scientific evidence was considered

            This is referred to as the multiple-factor test. The United States Supreme Court
            addressed questions related to expert evidence in Kumho Tire v. Carmichael. The Court concluded that judges
            have considerable discretion to determine reliability and validity. Zirogiannis states that this decision
            permits the introduction of novel expert analysis. Refer to Zirogiannis (2001) for a more detailed
            explanation of evidentiary issues for the introduction of expert evidence.</dd>
          <dt>Supervised Contact:</dt>
          <dd>Supervised contact usually refers to supervision of the time that a child spends with a non-residential
            parent. A member of the extended family may provide the supervision. In some cases it is provided in a
            formal setting such as an Access Centre.</dd>
          <dt>Target Parent:</dt>
          <dd>The target parent is the parent whose relationship with the child is undermined or obstructed (i.e. the
            target of alienating behaviour).</dd>
          <dt>Transfers:</dt>
          <dd>Transfer refers to the child shifting from one parent care to the other parent's care.</dd>
