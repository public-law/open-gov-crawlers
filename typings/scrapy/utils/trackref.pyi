"""This module provides some functions and classes to record and report
references to live object instances.

If you want live objects for a particular class to be tracked, you only have to
subclass from object_ref (instead of object).

About performance: This library has a minimal performance impact when enabled,
and no performance penalty at all when disabled (as object_ref becomes just an
alias to object in that case).
