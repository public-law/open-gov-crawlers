    Return a "deprecated" class that causes its subclasses to issue a warning.
    Subclasses of ``new_class`` are considered subclasses of this class.
    It also warns when the deprecated class is instantiated, but do not when
    its subclasses are instantiated.

    It can be used to rename a base class in a library. For example, if we
    have

        class OldName(SomeClass):
            # ...

    and we want to rename it to NewName, we can do the following::

        class NewName(SomeClass):
            # ...

        OldName = create_deprecated_class('OldName', NewName)

    Then, if user class inherits from OldName, warning is issued. Also, if
    some code uses ``issubclass(sub, OldName)`` or ``isinstance(sub(), OldName)``
    checks they'll still return True if sub is a subclass of NewName instead of
    OldName.
