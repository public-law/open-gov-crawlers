    The scheduler component is responsible for storing requests received from
    the engine, and feeding them back upon request (also to the engine).

    The original sources of said requests are:

    * Spider: ``start_requests`` method, requests created for URLs in the ``start_urls`` attribute, request callbacks
    * Spider middleware: ``process_spider_output`` and ``process_spider_exception`` methods
    * Downloader middleware: ``process_request``, ``process_response`` and ``process_exception`` methods

    The order in which the scheduler returns its stored requests (via the ``next_request`` method)
    plays a great part in determining the order in which those requests are downloaded.

    The methods defined in this class constitute the minimal interface that the Scrapy engine will interact with.

    Default Scrapy scheduler. This implementation also handles duplication
    filtering via the :setting:`dupefilter <DUPEFILTER_CLASS>`.

    This scheduler stores requests into several priority queues (defined by the
    :setting:`SCHEDULER_PRIORITY_QUEUE` setting). In turn, said priority queues
    are backed by either memory or disk based queues (respectively defined by the
    :setting:`SCHEDULER_MEMORY_QUEUE` and :setting:`SCHEDULER_DISK_QUEUE` settings).

    Request prioritization is almost entirely delegated to the priority queue. The only
    prioritization performed by this scheduler is using the disk-based queue if present
    (i.e. if the :setting:`JOBDIR` setting is defined) and falling back to the memory-based
    queue if a serialization error occurs. If the disk queue is not present, the memory one
    is used directly.
