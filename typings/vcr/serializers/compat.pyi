    If the request body is a string, encode it to bytes (for python3 support)

    By default yaml serializes to utf-8 encoded bytestrings.
    When this cassette is loaded by python3, it's automatically decoded
    into unicode strings. This makes sure that it stays a bytestring, since
    that's what all the internal httplib machinery is expecting.
