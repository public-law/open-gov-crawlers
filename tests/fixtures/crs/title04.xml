    <B>Annotator's note.</B>
    <M>Since § 4-1-103 is similar to §§
4-1-102
and 4-1-103 as they existed prior to the 2006 repeal and reenactment of this article,
relevant
cases construing those provisions have been included in the annotations to this section.</M>

   <P></P>
   <T>
    <B>The parties to a contract may vary the provisions of the Uniform Commercial
Code (UCC)
by agreement </B> and may provide for remedies in addition to or in substitution for
those
provided by the UCC. Colorado Interstate Gas Co. v. Chemco,
Inc.,
854 P.2d 1232 (Colo. 1993).</T>
   <P></P>
   <T>
    <B>Evidence of current commercial practices and customs</B> are considered
when
interpreting the UCC. The practice and custom of this state's real estate closings is that an
original note is not presented at the closing. Citywide Banks v. Armijo, 313 P.3d 647
(Colo. App. 2011).</T>
   <P></P>
   <T>
    <B>Section 90(1) of the restatement (second) of contracts adopted,</B> which
articulates the doctrine of promissory estoppel. Kiely v. St. Germain, 670 P.2d 764
(Colo.
1983).</T>
   <P></P>
   <T>
    <B>The UCC does not exclude the application of promissory estoppel.</B>
Germain
v. Boshouwers, 646 P.2d 952 (Colo. App. 1982), aff'd in part and rev'd in part on other
grounds, 670 P.2d 764 (Colo. 1983).</T>
   <P></P>
   <T>Recovery will be allowed on a theory of promissory estoppel, notwithstanding a
statute
of frauds defense, if injustice can be avoided only by enforcement of the promise.
Germain
v. Boshouwers, 646 P.2d 952 (Colo. App. 1982), aff'd in part and rev'd in part on other
grounds, 670 P.2d 764 (Colo. 1983).</T>
   <P></P>
   <T>
    <B>Elements of promissory estoppel</B> are: (1) A promise which the promisor
should
reasonably expect to induce action or forbearance of a definite and substantial character
on
the part of the promisee; and (2) which does induce such action or forbearance; and (3) if
injustice can be avoided only by enforcement of the promise. Germain v. Boshouwers,
646
P.2d 952 (Colo. App. 1982), aff'd in part and rev'd in part on other grounds, 670 P.2d
764
(Colo. 1983).</T>
   <P></P>
   <T>
    <B>The doctrine of estoppel was properly applied</B> in a case arising under the
secured transaction provisions of the code. First Nat'l Bank v. Ulibarri, 38 Colo. App.
428,
557 P.2d 1221 (1976).</T>
   <P></P>
   <T>
    <B>Detrimental reliance upon oral promises.</B> The principle embodied in
section
139 of the restatement (second) of contracts that detrimental action performed in
justifiable
reliance upon oral promises may be sufficient to compel full or partial performance of the
promise in spite of the applicability of a statute of frauds defense was applicable in a case
involving an oral agreement to sell securities. Kiely v. St. Germain, 670 P.2d 764 (Colo.
1983).</T>
   <P></P>
   <T>
    <B>Section 4-3-419 (3) does not explicitly displace common-law cause of action for
moneys had </B> and received. Citizens State Bank v. Nat'l Sur. Corp., 199 Colo. 497,
612
P.2d 70 (1980).</T>
   <P></P>
   <T>
    <B>Common-law claim for money had and received is still viable</B> since the
uniform commercial code contains no provision dealing with such a claim. Nat'l Sur.
Corp.
v. Citizens State Bank, 41 Colo. App. 580, 593 P.2d 362 (1978), aff'd, 199 Colo. 497,
612
P.2d 70 (1980).</T>
   <P></P>
   <T>
    <B>The common law of agency supplements the UCC.</B> So, payment to an
authorized agent has the same legal effect as payment to the holder. Citywide Banks v.
Armijo, 313 P.3d 647 (Colo. App. 2011).</T>
   <P></P>
   <T>
    <B>Statute as basis for jurisdiction.</B> Stroh v. Am. Recreation &amp; Mobile Home

  </T>
  <P N="(b)(3.5)"></P>

which would apprise him of possible irregularities some inquiry is required

inquire reveals a deliberate desire to evade knowledge because of a fear that

Although damages may not be calculable with mathematical exactitude, so
long as the plaintiff introduces some evidence which is sufficient to allow
a reasonable estimate of damages, it is incumbent upon the trier of fact
to determine a monetary award which will adequately compensate the plaintiff.

performance is impaired. The burden of establishing lack of good faith is on the party
against which the power has been exercised.</SECTION-TEXT>

    <B>Burden on plaintiff to prove preexisting oral contract.</B>
Under this section the burden is on the plaintiff to prove that an oral
contract had
been entered into before the purchase order was drawn, and to constitute a
sufficient
writing to take the oral contract outside the statute of frauds, the writing must be "in
confirmation of the contract". Nations Enters., Inc. v. Process Equip. Co., 40

    <B>Defendant has burden of proving the applicability of this section as an
affirmative
defense to a breach of contract claim. However, the burden switches back to the plaintiff

error for the trial court to instruct the jury that the defendant had the burden of proving
that
he was not a merchant and that no confirmatory writing was sent. Am. Pride Co-op

   <T>
    <B>Totality of circumstances support trial court's conclusion that plaintiff
intended to retain ownership of goods</B> and that defendant's conduct did not
constitute an acceptance for purposes of exception to the

was barred by statute of frauds. Lockhart v. Elm, 736 P.2d 429 (Colo. App.

   <T>If the primary purpose of the contract is the sale of goods and the

performance. A right to damages for breach of the whole contract or a right arising out of

buyer for damages caused by the delegation to the extent that the damages could not
reasonably be prevented by the buyer, and (ii) a court having jurisdiction may grant other

    <B>An express warranty may be inferred from an affirmation of a fact or a

   <P></P>
   <T>
    <B>An averment at the time of the sale is a warranty provided</B> the
jury finds from the evidence on the trial it was so intended. Such
intention may be reached as an inference or deduction from the facts or
circumstances in connection with all the evidence on the trial, and when
such deduction is made, if it rests upon proper and sufficient evidence, it
becomes proof as a fact of warranty. Rudd v. Rogerson, 133 Colo.
506, 297 P.2d 533 (1956).</T>
   <P></P>
   <T>
    <B>There can be no operative warranty unless it be affirmatively
shown that the buyer relied</B> on the affirmation of fact or promise of the
seller. The affirmation asserted as a warranty must have been
operative in causing the sale and must have been understood by the buyer as
being intended as part of the contract. It need not, however, have been
the sole inducement to the purchase, nor need the buyer actually
have been deceived by the statement. Only such reliance is required as is
necessary in contracts generally, and where a representation has entered
into the contract as an intended element thereof and as a part of
the consideration, the requirement that it be an inducement in order to be
operative as a warranty is fully satisfied. Duncan v. Bd. of County
Comm'rs, 154 Colo. 447, 391 P.2d 368 (1964).</T>
   <P></P>
   <T>
    <B>There is no duty on the buyer of goods who purchases with an
express warranty to inspect</B> the article purchased, or to exercise care in
discovering any defects, or to investigate the truth of the seller's
statements; rather, he may rely on the contract of the seller for the
delivery of goods which satisfy the warranty, except that the contract may
expressly provide for an inspection or test to be made by the
purchaser as a condition. Rudd v. Rogerson, 133 Colo. 506, 297 P.2d 533
(1956).</T>
   <P></P>
   <T>
    <B>The maxim "caveat emptor" has no application</B> to matters
included in an express warranty, and even where the buyer has an equal
opportunity with the seller to form his own judgment as to the
character and condition of the property he may receive and rely on a
warranty instead; opportunity on the part of the buyer to inspect does not
militate against the availability of an express warranty in the sale.

   <P></P>

    <B>Even though the buyer makes an inspection the warranty is not rendered

   <P></P>
   <T>
    <B>Writing does not exclude undertaking by seller.</B> Where a letter addressed
to the buyer and signed by the seller described a machine, but did not include
a provision as to its ability to produce, then,
nevertheless, where it appeared that there were numerous conversations between
the parties and that the buyer fully explained to the seller the machine was to
be used on a mass production basis and its intricacies
were also made known to the seller from the beginning, it cannot be said that
the writing excluded undertakings by the seller in the light of the buyer's
requirements that the seller produce a machine which would
fulfill specific needs. Comet Indus., Inc. v. Best Plastic Container Corp.,

    <B>Testimony that the seller specifically "guaranteed" or
"promised"</B> that an article would work satisfactorily and that it was
clearly understood by all that the seller would get paid if, and only

warranty. Duncan v. Bd. of County Comm'rs, 154 Colo. 447, 391 P.2d 368

   <P></P>

    <B>The word "sound" when used with reference to many animals</B> and

Where plaintiff's experts raise a factual question about the reasonableness of

improper, and the issue of whether the design of the car unreasonably increased
the risks of injury by collision should be presented to the jury. Roberts v.

    <B>The buyer of a machine may,</B> either under the common law or this

    <B>Implied warranty liability extended to component parts manufacturer.</B>
As in the area of strict liability, implied warranty liability may extend to the
manufacturer of component parts if the lack of fitness for the purpose or use required
is found in the component parts before they leave the component parts manufacturer, and
not merely in the completed system. Union Supply Co. v. Pust, 196 Colo.

    <B>Plaintiff established a prima facie case of breach of warranty</B>
and injury resulting from that breach, where it was shown that the
plaintiff used the product according to the manufacturer's directions

sellers of unfit merchandise under certain conditions. In order to
negative this declaration of public policy, the express agreement
provided for in this section must be clear, unequivocal, and the result of
a genuine agreement between the parties, and where there is an attempt to
negative an implied warranty of fitness by a broad general
disclaimer, it must appear that the so-called disclaimer was clearly
brought to the attention of the buyer and agreed to by him in order for

An option to return a purchase, if one
does not approve, is different from an option
to purchase, if one does approve. In the
former case, the title passes, subject to the
right to rescind and return; in the latter, the
title does not pass until the option to buy is
determined. The former is a sale and delivery,
the latter a bailment which may be converted
into a sale, at the option of the bailee.

Consignment transactions, in which the owner (consignor)

   <P></P>
   <T>
    <B>The purpose of this section is</B> to allow a
creditor of a dealer to attach a lien against
property of a third person which is in the
dealer's possession on consignment and to
permit the creditor to treat such property as if
it were owned by the dealer. Am. Nat'l

    <B>Security interest not affected by transfer
of possession.</B> A security interest in consigned
goods, having attached while the chattels
were in consignee's possession, is not
affected by a subsequent transfer of possession
of the chattels from the consignee to the
consignor, the transfer of possession of
machines to being in violation of the perfected
security interest in the chattels, and the
secured party is entitled to recover possession
of the goods from consignor or to recover the
value of the goods if a return could not be

   <P></P>
   <T>This rule is consistent with the rights of a
secured party as they existed prior to the
enactment of the uniform commercial code,
for, under the chattel mortgage statutes in
effect prior to the adoption of the code, the
rights of a mortgagee of chattels were superior
to the rights of one acquiring possession
of the chattels from the mortgagor even
where the transfer purported to be absolute
and in exclusion of the rights of the mortgagee,
and in such cases, the mortgagee could

his goods with a dealer for sale under consignment

Consignment transactions (i.e., where title does

subsection (3) is established. Am. Nat'l

    <B>Sufficient evidence.</B> Finding that a dealer "was
conducting or was substantially engaged in

absent a finding that the dealer was "generally
known by his creditors" to be substantially
engaged in selling the goods of others,

support such a finding. Am. Nat'l Bank

    <B>Evidence cannot be based on hearsay.</B>
Where the trial court allowed the consignor's witnesses,
both creditors and others, to testify
that consignee was engaged in selling goods of
others but refused to permit these witnesses
to testify to conversations with other persons
concerning the knowledge of such other persons
that consignee was engaged in selling the
goods of others, such testimony was properly
excluded as hearsay. Am. Nat'l Bank v.

   <P></P>
   <T>
    <B>Where the creditor properly protects its interest</B>
in an item delivered to a
dealer by filing according to subsection (3)(c)

provision, nor otherwise does anything to manifest
its interest in the item, the rights of the
creditor are superior. Am. Nat'l Bank v.

   <T>
    <B>Right cannot be circumscribed by
estoppel.</B> Since the maxim that "equity follows
the law" applies where a legal right is
clearly established by a secured party under
this section, the equitable doctrine of estoppel
cannot be used to circumscribe that right, and
the effect of this principle is reinforced where
the secured party made no misrepresentation
upon which consignor relied to his detriment.

Each provision of this article with regard to the rights,
obligations, and remedies of the seller, the buyer, purchasers, or other
third parties applies irrespective of title to the goods, except where
the provision refers to such title. Insofar as situations are not
covered by the other provisions of this article and matters concerning
title become material, the following rules apply:
<P N="(1)"></P>
  <T>(1)<M>Title to goods cannot pass under a contract for sale prior to
their identification to the contract (section 4-2-501), and unless
otherwise explicitly agreed, the buyer acquires by their identification
a special property as limited by this title. Any retention or
reservation by the seller of the title (property) in goods shipped or
delivered to the buyer is limited in effect to a reservation of a
security interest. Subject to these provisions and to the provisions of
the article on secured transactions (article 9 of this title), title to
goods passes from the seller to the buyer in any manner and on any
conditions explicitly agreed on by the parties.</M>
  </T>
  <P N="(2)"></P>
  <T>(2)<M>Unless otherwise explicitly agreed, title passes to the buyer at
the time and place at which the seller completes his performance with
reference to the physical delivery of the goods, despite any reservation
of a security interest and even though a document of title is to be
delivered at a different time or place; and in particular and despite
any reservation of a security interest by the bill of lading:</M>
  </T>
  <P N="(2)(a)"></P>
  <T>(a)<M>If the contract requires or authorizes the seller to send the
goods to the buyer but does not require him to deliver them at
destination, title passes to the buyer at the time and place of
shipment; but</M>
  </T>
  <P N="(2)(b)"></P>
  <T>(b)<M>If the contract requires delivery at destination, title passes

without moving the goods:</M>
  </T>
  <P N="(3)(a)"></P>
  <T>(a)<M>If the seller is to deliver a tangible document of title, title passes at the time
when and the place where the seller delivers such documents, and if the seller is to deliver
an electronic document of title, title passes when the seller delivers the document; or</M>
  </T>
  <P N="(3)(b)"></P>
  <T>(b)<M>If the goods are at the time of contracting already identified and no documents
of title are to be delivered, title passes at the time and place of contracting.</M>
  </T>
  <P N="(4)"></P>
  <T>(4)<M>A rejection or other refusal by the buyer to receive or retain
the goods, whether or not justified, or a justified revocation of
acceptance revests title to the goods in the seller. Such revesting

  <T>(5)<M>Notwithstanding any other provision
of this section, when livestock have been delivered under a contract of sale,

inspection certificate the seller has conspicuously noted that payment of

until payment is made.</M>

Where plaintiffs' testimony revealed that it was their intent

of sale after giving the buyer possession of the assets was, at most,
a reservation of title, and as such acted as a reservation of a security
interest in the property. Young v. Golden State Bank, 39 Colo. App. 45,

purchaser's agent. At the moment the seller delivered the certificates
of title to the purchaser, through the bank as its agent, the requirements

were properly transferred, the purchaser was clothed with voidable title and

The right to reclaim created by subsection (2) of this section is a right to

the transaction, not a right to "secure" payment of the price as required
by the definition of "security interest" under § 4-1-201 (37). Guy Martin

after payment is made, but the purchaser is limited to receiving
a voidable title when the purchase price is conveyed in the form of

    <B>Purchaser took voidable title on proper transfer of title certificates.</B>
Where before the seller presented the purchaser's check for collection, the
certificates
of title to automobiles were delivered to a bank as security for the bank's
loan
to the purchaser, in accordance with a security agreement between the purchaser
and bank, it could be implied that the bank took possession of
the certificates of title as the purchaser's agent. At the
moment the seller delivered the certificates of title to the purchaser,
through the bank as its agent, the requirements of § 42-6-108
were satisfied. Moreover, once the certificates of title were properly
transferred, the purchaser was clothed with voidable title and could
legally encumber the automobiles.

   <P></P>
   <T>In the law governing breach of warranty, the notice requirement serves
three useful purposes: First, notice provides the seller a chance to correct
any defect; second, notice affords the seller an opportunity to prepare

safeguard against stale claims being asserted after it is too late for the
manufacturer or seller to investigate them. Prutch v. Ford Motor Co., 618

    <B>Communication of defects and of recourse to attorney suffices.</B>
Although a formal notice was not given, where the buyer communicated with
the seller and notified him of the defects in the goods and the seller
acquired firsthand knowledge, the seller could scarcely
have concluded that these were mere protests in view of the fact that the
buyer had told him that the matter was in the hands of his attorney. Comet

    <B>Burden on buyer to prove defects existed at time of sale.</B> The burden

setting up such defects as an affirmative defense in an action for the
price, to prove that the defects existed at the time of sale and did not
result from deterioration after shipment or from the buyer's negligence

    <B>Buyer must be able to transfer unencumbered title.</B>
In order to exercise the remedy of revocation after acceptance,
the buyer must, as of the date seller offers to return the purchase price and
expenses, or if seller makes no such offer, as of the date the trial court
awards buyer this remedy, be in a position to transfer an unencumbered title
to the seller.
Moeller Mfg., Inc. v. Mattis, 33 Colo. App. 300, 519 P.2d 1218 (1974).</T>
   <P></P>
   <T>
    <B>There is no requirement under the provisions of the UCC that on revocation
of acceptance a buyer must deliver title</B> to the goods to the seller. Under
§ 4-2-711 (3), a buyer retains a
security interest in goods in his possession for any payment made on their
price and may resell the goods in the same manner as an aggrieved seller. And,
where a buyer does not exercise his right of
resale, generally all that is required is that the buyer assign to the seller
all of his interest in the goods. Jackson v. Rocky Mtn. Datsun, Inc., 693
P.2d 391 (Colo. App. 1984).</T>
   <P></P>
   <T>
    <B>Remedy is for damages under § 4-2-714.</B>
When the buyer has encumbered the title and is not able effectively to
transfer the goods to the seller, then buyer's remedy is for damages
pursuant to § 4-2-714.

   <P></P>
   <T>
    <B>Buyer vested with security interest upon revocation.</B>
If a revocation of acceptance of a mobile home is justifiable
under this section, § 4-2-711 (3) vests the buyer with a security interest
in the home, and such an interest authorizes continued possession to
preserve the collateral, pursuant to § 4-9-207 (1) and (4), subject
to the seller's right to an offset for the rental value of the home.
Keen v. Modern Trailer Sales, Inc., 40 Colo. App. 527, 578 P.2d 668 (1978).</T>
   <P></P>
   <T>
    <B>Buyer may revoke acceptance if he accepts goods on the reasonable assumption
that
a
nonconformity will be cured</B> by the seller and the
nonconformity is not "seasonably cured". Buyer is not
required to provide the seller with an unlimited number
of opportunities to cure a nonconformity before revoking acceptance. Jackson v. Rocky
Mtn. Datsun, Inc., 693 P.2d 391 (Colo. App. 1984).</T>
   <P></P>
   <T>
    <B>When the buyer reaccepts goods with the understanding that the seller will cure
the defect,</B> the buyer must then afford the seller an opportunity to cure the defect
before revoking acceptance or claiming a breach of warranty. Ranta Constr., Inc. v.

   <P></P>
   <T>
    <B>Buyer was not required to set out in detail the car's nonconformities</B> in her

Inc.,
693
P.2d 391 (Colo. App. 1984).</T>
   <P></P>
   <T>
    <B>Contrary to trial court's determination, there is no "formal notice of revocation"
requirement under this section, nor does it exist under § 4-2-607.</B> This section
does not require that a revocation of acceptance assume any particular format, but rather
that the content of the notice be determined by "considerations of good faith, prevention
of surprise, and reasonable adjustment." The notice of revocation, to be sufficient,
should
fairly apprise the seller that the buyer wants to give back the goods and receive a
substitute or money in return. Here, letter that described in detail dryers' alleged defects,
attempted to reject acceptance of the dryers, demanded that seller remove the machines
from the premises, and requested that damages be paid to buyer and the laundromat
owner provided adequate notice of revocation. Cissell Mfg. Co. v. Park, 36 P.3d 85
(Colo. App. 2001).</T>
   <P></P>
   <T>
    <B>To prove a valid revocation of acceptance, a buyer must show, among other
things, that the goods were nonconforming.</B> Determination of an item's
nonconformity hinges on whether it substantially impairs its value to the buyer. Whether
goods are nonconforming requires reference to the terms of the contract and the law of
warranty. If the goods are contracted for and as warranted, they cannot be
nonconforming. Cissell Mfg. Co. v. Park, 36 P.3d 85 (Colo. App. 2001).</T>

Since § 4-2-715 is similar to repealed § 121-1-70, C.R.S. 1963, and

provisions have been included in the annotations to this section.</T>
   <P></P>
   <T>
    <B>Interest and carrying charges are consequential damages.</B>
Where the goods purchased are entirely worthless and the only way buyer can
be made whole is by awarding him the full amount of the obligation he
undertook to pay at the time he purchased the goods, then the
interest and carrying charges incurred at the time the sale was made are
clearly consequential damages directly resulting from the breach of
warranty. Cherokee Inv. Co. v. Voiles, 166 Colo. 270, 443 P.2d 727 (1968).</T>
   <P></P>
   <T>
    <B>Special damages where machine is unsuitable.</B>
Where there is a breach of a special warranty whereby a seller undertakes
to build a machine suitable for a mass production purpose, the buyer is
entitled to special damages for its expenditure in the manufacture of the
tools and dies to be used with the machine and to those expenditures
reasonably attributed to efforts to adjust and repair the machine before
the date when notice of breach of warranty was given to the buyer. Comet

   <P></P>
   <T>
    <B>Code rejects "tacit agreement" test.</B>
The Colorado statutory scheme rejects the "tacit agreement" test that would
permit consequential damages only if the seller specifically contemplated
or actually assumed the risk of such damages. Prutch v. Ford Motor Co.,
618 P.2d 657 (Colo. 1980).</T>
   <P></P>
   <T>
    <B>The element which triggers recovery of consequential damages
under subsection (2)(a)</B> is foreseeability. Subsection (2)(a)
means that consequential damages are recoverable whenever those damages
were reasonably foreseeable by the seller when he entered the contract.

   <P></P>
   <T>
    <B>"Reason to know" formulation not exclusive remedy in fraud suits.</B>
The code does not require that the "reason to know" formulation be applied in
fraud suits to the exclusion of other remedies; it only provides that the
remedies available under the "reason to know" formulation are included
among the remedies available to a defrauded purchaser.

   <P></P>
   <T>
    <B>Attempt to mitigate losses not intervening cause of damages.</B>
Where plaintiffs, in deciding to continue farming with the knowledge that
their equipment might continue to malfunction, actually mitigated their
losses, their decision to try to produce at least part of a normal crop,
rather than no crop at all, was required by their "duty to lessen, rather
than increase", their damages and was not an intervening cause of damages.

   <B>Editor's note - Colorado legislative change:</B>
In the first sentence of subsection (1) of this section, after the words
"must be commenced within", Colorado deleted the words "4 years after the
cause of action accrued." and substituted the words "the time period
prescribed in section 13-80-101, C.R.S.". Colorado deleted the second
sentence (which read: "By the original lease contract the parties may reduce
the period of limitation to not less than one year.") and substituted the
following sentence: "This period of limitation may not be varied by agreement
of the parties.". These changes parallel the changes that Colorado had
previously made to section 4-2-725 (1).</T>

  </T>
  <P N="(a)(3)"></P>
  <T>(3)<M>Does not state any other undertaking or instruction by
the person promising or ordering payment to do any act in addition
to the payment of money, but the promise or order may contain (i)
an undertaking or power to give, maintain, or protect collateral

however expressed, to the effect that the promise or order is not
negotiable or is not an instrument governed by this article.</M>
  </T>
  <P N="(e)"></P>
  <T>(e)<M>An instrument is a "note" if it is a promise and is a
"draft" if it is an order. If an instrument falls within the

The following annotations include cases decided under former provisions
similar to this section.</T>
   <P></P>
   <T>
    <B>Conditional language in promissory note referencing conditions in the
bill of sale and covenants not to compete</B> renders it nonnegotiable but
does not make the note unenforceable. DBA Enter., Inc. v. Findlay, 923 P.2d
298 (Colo. App. 1996).</T>
   <P></P>
   <T>
    <B>A note authorizing confession of judgment</B> in the event of nonpayment
does not render the note nonnegotiable. Axelson v. Dailey Coop. Co., 88
Colo. 555, 298 P. 957 (1931).</T>
   <P></P>
   <T>
    <B>The authority to confess judgment is construed strictly</B> against
the party in whose favor it is given. Stewart v. Pub. Indus. Bank, 85
Colo. 546, 277 P. 782 (1929).</T>
   <P></P>
   <T>
    <B>"Owing" construed as "due".</B>
Where a note was made payable on or before 12 months after date, to be paid
in monthly installments, a provision permitting a judgment for amounts then
"owing", was construed to permit a judgment for amounts then
"due". Stewart v. Pub. Indus. Bank, 85 Colo. 546, 277 P. 782 (1929).</T>
   <P></P>
   <T>
    <B>Note payable in installments is negotiable.</B> A promissory note made
payable on or before 12 months after date to be paid in monthly
installments is negotiable, inasmuch as principal of note payable one year
from date is "owing" when note is given but is not then
"due". Stewart v. Pub. Indus. Bank, 85 Colo. 546, 277 P. 782 (1929).</T>
   <P></P>
   <T>
    <B>Where the holder of a note payable in installments agrees to
postpone</B> subsequent installments upon the payment of pending interim
installments, thereby extending the time of the installments, there is an
accord and satisfaction without regard to the question of consideration for
an extension where the debtor fulfills the requirements. French v.
Commercial Credit Co., 99 Colo. 447, 64 P.2d 127 (1936).</T>
   <P></P>
   <T>
    <B>Principal not altered as basis of interest.</B>
Provision in note that upon a contingency a portion of the note should be
cancelled does not alter the principal amount of the note as the basis of
interest computation. Colo. Herald Publ'g Co. v. Neuhaus, 117 Colo.
172, 184 P.2d 1011 (1947).</T>

    <B>Construction of promissory note should be adopted which is favorable to
validity</B> of instrument. Metro. State Bank v. McNutt, 73 Colo. 291,
215 P. 151 (1923).</T>
   <P></P>
   <T>
    <B>For a promissory note to be negotiable,</B>
and to pass to an indorsee thereof the protections afforded to a
"holder in due course", it must contain both an unconditional
promise to pay and a fixed or determinable date of payment. Bank of
Kimball v. Rostek, 161 Colo. 584, 423 P.2d 579 (1967).</T>
   <P></P>
   <T>
    <B>To be a negotiable instrument subject to the statutes governing such
instruments,
an instrument must contain an unconditional promise to pay a fixed amount of money on
demand or at a definite time.</B> If a written agreement makes an obligation to pay
subject to an express condition, not payable on demand, the agreement is not a negotiable
instrument, and the statutory provisions relating to negotiable instruments are
inapplicable
to the transaction. Reid v. Pyle, 51 P.3d 1064 (Colo. App. 2002).</T>
   <P></P>
   <T>Where plaintiff's obligation to pay was expressly conditioned on "the sale or
transference" of the property, the promissory note was not a negotiable instrument. Reid
v.
Pyle, 51 P.3d 1064 (Colo. App. 2002).</T>
   <P></P>
   <T>
    <B>A note conditioned on its face on services to be rendered</B> and
which is not to be paid until the object of the services is secured is
nonnegotiable. Mulligan v. Smith, 13 Colo. App. 231, 57 P. 731 (1899).</T>
   <P></P>
   <T>
    <B>Recitation that note is secured does not render a note nonnegotiable.</B>
A promissory note containing an unconditional promise to pay a definite
amount on demand is not rendered nonnegotiable because it recites that it
is secured by a quitclaim deed. First Nat'l Bank v. Mineral Farm Co., 17
Colo. App. 452, 68 P. 981 (1902).</T>
   <P></P>
   <T>
    <B>Provisions for foreclosure.</B>
Where a negotiable note is secured by a deed of trust, provisions in the
deed providing for foreclosure upon the grantor's failure to pay taxes and
insurance do not render the note uncertain as to amount or time of payment.
Frost v. Fisher, 13 Colo. App. 322, 58 P. 872 (1899).</T>
   <P></P>
   <T>
    <B>Uncertainty as to time of payment of a note does not
affect it as an enforceable contract</B> between the parties thereto,
although it makes it nonnegotiable. Simpson v. Baber, 74 Colo. 175,
220 P. 235 (1923).</T>
   <P></P>
   <T>
    <B>The fact that a note does not contain the words "to order" or
"to bearer"</B> does not affect its negotiability.

    <B>A check is a species of bill of exchange,</B> viz., that particular kind
of a bill which is drawn on a bank and payable on demand. Van Buskirk v.

   <P></P>
   <T>
    <B>A check is considered a thing of value.</B>

    <B>Where one issues a check there is an implied representation that</B>
there are sufficient funds in bank at the time to cover the check.

   <P></P>
   <T>
    <B>A bank certificate of deposit is a negotiable instrument</B> and subject

   <P></P>
   <T>
    <B>Instrument acknowledging existing debt is not promissory note.</B>
Shearer v. Shearer, 84 Colo. 234, 269 P. 19 (1928).</T>
   <P></P>
   <T>
    <B>For purposes of a cashier's check, since the issuing bank is both the drawer and
the drawee, the check becomes a promise by the bank to draw the amount of the check
from its own resources and to pay the check upon demand.</B> Flatiron Linen, Inc. v.
First Amer. State Bank, 23 P.3d 1209 (Colo. 2001).</T>
   <P></P>
   <T>
    <B>Thus, the issuance of a cashier's check constitutes an acceptance by the issuing
bank</B> and the cashier's check itself becomes the primary obligation of the bank.
Flatiron Linen, Inc. v. First Amer. State Bank, 23 P.3d 1209 (Colo. 2001).</T>
   <P></P>
   <T>
    <B>Once the bank issues and delivers the cashier's check to the payee, the
transaction is complete as far as the payee is concerned.</B> Flatiron Linen, Inc. v. First
Amer. State Bank, 23 P.3d 1209 (Colo. 2001).</T>
   <P></P>
   <T>
    <B>Because the issuing bank is obligated to pay the cashier's check upon
presentment, a cashier's check is essentially the same as cash.</B> Flatiron Linen, Inc. v.
First Amer. State Bank, 23 P.3d 1209 (Colo. 2001).</T>
   <P></P>
   <T>
    <B>Cashier's checks represent the unconditional obligation of the issuing bank to

   <T>
    <B>A negotiable instrument is not rendered nonnegotiable by provisions for
attorney fees</B> if not paid at maturity. Cowing v. Cloud, 16 Colo. App.
326, 65 P. 417 (1901).</T>
   <P></P>
   <T>
    <B>A stipulation for attorney's fees is intended to protect the
holder</B> against loss, if the maker fails to fulfill his undertaking, and
there is no reason why the latter may not contract to bear the result
occasioned by his own default. Florence Oil Ref. Co. v. Hiawatha Gas, Oil,
&amp; Ref. Co., 55 Colo. 378, 135 P. 454 (1913).</T>
   <P></P>
   <T>
    <B>Indemnification for collection expenses.</B> A provision for a
fixed amount for attorney fees is an agreement to indemnify the holder
against expenses incurred in the employing of an attorney for the
enforcement of collection when the maker fails to keep his agreement.
Florence Oil Ref. Co. v. Hiawatha Gas, Oil, &amp; Ref. Co., 55 Colo. 378,
135 P. 454 (1913).</T>
   <P></P>
   <T>
    <B>The holder can only recover such part thereof as will reimburse him
for the reasonable and necessary attorney fees</B> he has been compelled to
pay, or has become liable for, in enforcing the collection of the note.
Florence Oil Ref. Co. v. Hiawatha Gas, Oil, &amp; Ref. Co., 55 Colo. 378,
135 P. 454 (1913).</T>
   <P></P>
   <T>
    <B>Reasonableness of attorney fees is implicit in such an agreement.</B> Where
under the terms of a
note, the holder is authorized to collect attorney fees for collection
costs in case of default, implicit in such agreement is the recognition
that such attorney fees will be reasonable, that is, commensurate with
the actual labor and time expended by the attorney. Haffke v. Linker, 30
Colo. App. 61, 489 P.2d 1050 (1971).</T>
   <P></P>
   <T>
    <B>Expenses incurred must be actual and bona fide expenses.</B> Where a note
provides for an
attorney fee, and the holder of the note employs counsel, who
successfully brings suit on the note, a reasonable fee fixed by the court
may be included in the judgment. Such a provision amounts to an agreement
to indemnify the holder of the note against expenses actually incurred, and
the payment or obligation must be actual, bona fide, and reasonable. Luby
v. Jefferson County Bank, 28 Colo. App. 441, 476 P.2d 292 (1970).</T>
   <P></P>
   <T>
    <B>Attorney fees must be shown to have been incurred and reasonable.</B> The
holder of a note providing for the payment
of reasonable attorney fees upon collection is entitled to the recovery
of such a fee only upon a showing that the fee actually has been paid or
incurred, and that the amount of the fee is reasonable. Haffke v. Linker,
30 Colo. App. 76, 489 P.2d 1047 (1971).</T>
   <P></P>
   <T>
    <B>Necessity to prove that fees were actually incurred.</B> Proof that
attorney
fees provided for by a promissory note have actually been paid or incurred
is a material matter to be proven, because recompense is justified only as
indemnity to the note holder; absent proof of payment or obligation, there
is nothing to indemnify, and hence there can be no recovery. Reese v.
Lietzan, 160 Colo. 253, 419 P.2d 959 (1966).</T>
   <P></P>
   <T>
    <B>Fact of agreement does not establish reasonableness.</B> Merely
because there is an agreement as to a contingent fee between the holder and
an attorney does not mean that the sum agreed upon is a reasonable fee to
be assessed against the maker in an action to collect the balance due on
default. Haffke v. Linker, 30 Colo. App. 61, 489 P.2d 1050 (1971).</T>
   <P></P>
   <T>
    <B>Testimony of usual fee does not establish reasonableness.</B> Testimony
relating only to the
usual fee arrangement between the holder of a note and an attorney employed
by the holder to collect the note does not establish the reasonableness of
an attorney fee which a holder is entitled to recover from the maker in a
suit on a promissory note. Haffke v. Linker, 30 Colo. App. 76, 489 P.2d
1047 (1971).</T>

  </CATCH-LINE>
(a)<M>Except as
provided in this section, for the purposes of section 4-3-104 (a),
a promise or order is unconditional unless it states (i) an
express condition to payment, (ii) that the promise or order is
subject to or governed by another writing, or (iii) that rights
or obligations with respect to the promise or order are stated in
another writing. A reference to another writing does not of
itself make the promise or order conditional.</M>
  <P N="(b)"></P>
  <T>(b)<M>A promise or order is not made conditional (i) by a

  </T>
  <P N="(c)"></P>
  <T>(c)<M>If a promise or order requires, as a condition to
payment, a countersignature by a person whose specimen signature
appears on the promise or order, the condition does not make the
promise or order conditional for the purposes of section 4-3-104
(a). If the person whose specimen signature appears on an
instrument fails to countersign the instrument, the failure to
countersign is a defense to the obligation of the issuer, but the

the rights of a holder or transferee are subject to claims or
defenses that the issuer could assert against the original payee,
the promise or order is not thereby made conditional for the
purposes of section 4-3-104 (a); but if the promise or order is
an instrument, there cannot be a holder in due course of the
instrument.</M>

   <T>
    <B>A note, secured by a chattel mortgage and payable "on demand after

note is due at a date six months later, is not due after date of execution,
since the marginal notation must be construed with the mortgage as to a

    <B>Acceleration clause in mortgage does not apply to note.</B> A clause

    <B>No right to cure default in suit on note only.</B> Where suit after

    <B>Burden of proof where payee extends.</B> Where a note contains a clause

   <T>
    <B>Under common law and N.I.L.</B> the negotiable instruments law adopted
the common-law rule providing that where a check is payable to the order of
two or more persons who are not partners, all of them had to indorse unless
the one so doing had authority to indorse for the other payees, and this
joint indorsement was necessary for a complete negotiation; where one of
the payees failed to indorse, the negotiability of the check was completely
destroyed. Am. Nat'l Bank v. First Nat'l Bank, 130 Colo. 557,
277 P.2d 951 (1954).</T>

   <P></P>
   <T>
    <B>Holder acquires only a chose in action.</B>
The failure of one of two joint payees to indorse destroys the
negotiability of a check, and the holder of the check acquires only as an
assignee of a nonnegotiable chose in action the interest of the payee who
did indorse; as such an assignee, his interest in the proceeds of the check
is to be determined. Skinner v. Mortgage Inv. Co., 165 Colo. 241, 438 P.2d
504 (1968). See Am. Nat'l Bank v. First Nat'l Bank, 130 Colo. 557,
277 P.2d 951 (1954).</T>
   <P></P>
   <T>
    <B>The drawee bank is authorized to pay out funds belonging to its
depositor when,</B> and only when, the check is indorsed by the payees
therein, or by persons who have satisfied it or the bank to which the check
is presented for payment of their right to the proceeds. Am. Nat'l
Bank v. First Nat'l Bank, 130 Colo. 557, 277 P.2d 951 (1954).</T>
   <P></P>
   <T>
    <B>In the absence of actual fault on the part of the drawee,</B> its
failure to observe the fact of the absence of the indorsement of one of the
payees, due entirely to the fault or neglect of the holder, will not
preclude its recovery. Am. Nat'l Bank v. First Nat'l Bank, 130 Colo.
557, 277 P.2d 951 (1954).</T>
   <P></P>
   <T>
    <B>As a greater duty is imposed on the holder.</B>
The absence of an indorsement by the holder is as serious, if not more so,
than a forged indorsement; the first is easily discernible while the other
is the result of an error in the identification of the payee.
Consequently, if it is the duty of the bank cashing the check to know to a
positive certainty the identity of the payee named therein and its failure
so to do imposes a duty of reimbursing the drawee, it seems clear that the
failure to secure the indorsement of all of the payees imposes an even
greater duty on the holder. Am. Nat'l Bank v. First Nat'l Bank, 130
Colo. 557, 277 P.2d 951 (1954).</T>

Except as otherwise provided for
items in article 4 of this title, an instrument is payable at the
place of payment stated in the instrument. If no place of payment
is stated, an instrument is payable at the address of the drawee

place of payment is the place of business of the drawee or maker.
If a drawee or maker has more than one place of business, the
place of payment is any place of business of the drawee or maker
chosen by the person entitled to enforce the instrument. If the
drawee or maker has no place of business, the place of payment is
the residence of the drawee or maker.</SECTION-TEXT>

would not have destroyed its negotiability as the negotiability of
an instrument is not affected by the fact that it is undated,
antedated, or postdated. Thus, the stolen check indorsed by accused
falls squarely within the terms of the forgery statute under which

   <P></P>
   <T>
    <B>Although delivery is not made until trial date.</B> An assignee can
maintain its suit although the unindorsed notes are not delivered until the
date of trial, as it would be elevating form over substance to require a
new trial merely because the payee failed to deliver the notes before trial
where he had assigned them to the assignee before such date. Denver-Metro

    <B>Uncontradicted testimony of oral assignment suffices.</B> Where the
payee specifically testifies that he had made an oral assignment to the
assignee and no evidence is offered to contradict this testimony, such
testimony is sufficient to support the trial court's finding that an
assignment had been made to the assignee. Denver-Metro Collections, Inc.

    <B>Under the negotiable instruments law</B> an indorsement must have been
written on the instrument or upon a paper attached thereto, and the

277 P.2d 951 (1954).</T>

   <P></P>
   <T>
    <B>In an action on a note where an indorsement is denied by the
answer,</B> the mere production of the note by the plaintiff is insufficient;
rather both the execution and indorsement must be proved. Marks v. Munson,
59 Colo. 440, 149 P. 440 (1915); Myrick v.

   <T>
    <B>Production of a note by the plaintiff is a prima facie title under a
general denial.</B> In an action on a promissory note by the indorsee,
possession and production of the note by the plaintiff with an indorsement of
the payee's name is prima facie evidence of title in the plaintiff where the
title is at issue under a general denial. Gumaer v. Sowers, 31 Colo. 164, 71

    <B>The term "indorsement" is generally understood to mean</B>
the indorser's writing of his or her signature on the instrument or
some designation identifying the indorsement on the instrument.
A check simply inscribed "For deposit only" to an account other than
the payee's account and without the payee's signature is not an effective

The following annotations include cases decided under former provisions

   <P></P>
   <T>
    <B>Where an agent who receives checks is authorized to indorse them in
blank</B> and deposit them to his principal's credit in the principal's bank
and the bank has no knowledge of limitation upon the authority of the agent
to indorse the checks only when deposited for the principal's credit, and
the agent indorses and cashes a number of these checks for his own use
appropriating the money, which checks the bank also pays, the bank is not
liable to the principal for the checks thus appropriated by his agent. And
that the fact that such checks are indorsed by other persons in blank
following the indorsement by the agent for the principal while the checks
deposited in bank to the principal's credit are indorsed only by the agent
would not charge the bank with notice of the limitation upon the agent's
authority. Wedge Mines Co. v. Denver Nat'l Bank, 19 Colo. App. 182,
73 P. 873 (1903).</T>
   <P></P>
   <T>
    <B>The legal effect of a blank indorsement on a promissory note

   <T>
    <B>Addition by holder of the words "deposit only"</B> to indorser's blank
indorsement neither changed blank indorsement into a special indorsement, nor
altered the effect of the blank indorsement, but was in fact a restrictive
indorsement by holder which imposed a duty upon depository bank to honor
holder's restrictive indorsement. La Junta State Bank v. Travis, 727 P.2d 48

Where a depository bank specially indorsed a check to the plaintiff, who became

contrary to a restrictive indorsement "pay any bank", because the latter
special indorsement superseded the restrictive indorsement and such action by
the depository bank was the equivalent of a constructive cancellation. Thus,
any satisfaction to the ensuing holder was not inconsistent with the terms of
the previous restrictive indorsement. Lamson v. Commercial Credit Corp., 187

Reacquisition of an instrument
occurs if it is transferred to a former holder, by negotiation or
otherwise. A former holder who reacquires the instrument may
cancel indorsements made after the reacquirer first became a
holder of the instrument. If the cancellation causes the
instrument to be payable to the reacquirer or to bearer, the
reacquirer may negotiate the instrument. An indorser whose
indorsement is canceled is discharged, and the discharge is
effective against any subsequent holder.</SECTION-TEXT>

        <B>Knowledge of obtaining notes by false representations.</B> Where a

        <B>Knowledge of fraud.</B> In an action to obtain the return of a promissory

such facts, his action in taking the instrument amounted to bad faith, and
therefore he is not a holder in due course. Myers v. Griffith, 108 Colo. 218,

        <B>"Good faith" unaffected by payee's account level.</B> In the case of a bank
cashing a check, if the bank establishes that the check was taken without
notice of dishonor or of any other defense, this is sufficient to establish
"good faith". The issue of good faith, to establish that the bank is a holder
in due course, is unaffected by the fact that the payee's account is low or
overdrawn at the time the check is cashed. Vail Nat'l Bank v. J. Wheeler

          <B>One who has knowledge of all the facts of a transaction is not a holder

          <B>One offered negotiable paper fair upon its face, and not due, is under
no duty to inquire</B> of the maker as to its validity. Burnham Loan &amp; Inv.

         <P></P>
         <T>
          <B>If there is nothing on the face of a negotiable instrument, or in the
written indorsement or assignment, to notify</B> the assignee that the
instrument was originally given upon an illegal consideration (gambling
debts excepted) or obtained through fraud, the assignee who pays value
therefor, and takes the same in good faith before maturity, may recover as
against the maker. And this fact is true even though such assignee be in
possession of facts or circumstances sufficient to arouse suspicion in the
mind of a person of ordinary prudence and though he is guilty of negligence
in not first following up such information for the purpose of discovering
the fraud or illegality to which the suspicious circumstances may point.
This rule is founded upon commercial necessity, for the untrammeled
circulation of these instruments is a matter of supreme importance in the
vast field of mercantile transactions; drafts, bills of exchange and other
negotiable instruments take the place of money, and circulate almost as
freely. Hence, to hold that each assignee must, before accepting them,
inquire into each and every suspicious circumstance bearing upon the
original execution, or pointing to possible defenses in a suit between the
original parties, would produce serious inconveniences to the commercial
world. Hukill v. McGinnis, 70 Colo. 455, 202 P. 110 (1921); Hendrickson v.

         <T>
          <B>Even though bearing no revenue stamps.</B>
A promissory note, otherwise in due form, is complete and regular upon its
face although it bears no revenue stamps, since the absence of revenue
stamps is no notice to an indorsee of a promissory note of any infirmity in
the instrument or defect in the title of the person negotiating it, is not
a suspicious circumstance, and is no evidence that the note was taken in
bad faith. Metro. State Bank v. McNutt, 73 Colo. 291, 215 P. 151 (1923).</T>
         <P></P>
         <T>
          <B>Whether an instrument is complete and regular on its face is

         <P></P>
         <T>
          <B>Tests other than "actual knowledge" may be used</B> in resolving the issue
of whether an endorsee of a promissory note is a holder in due course including
whether the holder had in his possession facts from which he had reason
to know of the defenses "at the time in question". The critical time for
such notice is when the party comes into possession of the note as a holder.

         <P></P>
         <T>
          <B>Duty to inquire as to possible defenses.</B> Where an instrument is regular
on its face there is no duty on the part of a check cashing service to inquire
as to possible defenses, unless circumstances of which the holder has knowledge
are of such a nature that the failure to inquire reveals a deliberate desire to
evade knowledge because of a fear that investigation would disclose the
existence of a defense. Money Mart Check Cashing Center, Inc. v. Epicycle
Corp., 667 P.2d 1372 (Colo. 1983).</T>
         <P></P>
         <T>
          <B>When inquiry required.</B> If the purchaser has actual knowledge of facts
which would apprise him of possible irregularities some inquiry is required
by the notice provisions of the UCC. Salter v. Vanotti, 42 Colo. App. 448,

does not mature until presented to such bank for payment, and a purchaser by
indorsement before such presentment is a holder in due course, but not after
maturity. Citizens' Nat'l Bank v. First Nat'l Bank, 66 Colo. 426, 182 P. 12

Purchaser's knowledge, at the time of accepting a note, that the pledgor

    <B>Where a guaranteed renewal note is given</B> in payment of, or as security

  <ANNO-TEXT>
   <T>
    <B>Lack of consideration not a defense.</B>
The maker of a promissory note may not defend in an action against him by a
bona fide holder in due course on the ground that the assignment to the
holder was without consideration. Asiatic Tunnel Co. v. Stephenson, 63
Colo. 301, 165 P. 773 (1917).</T>
   <P></P>
   <T>
    <B>One cannot avoid liability on a note even if it be conceded that
there was a breach of contract</B> between him and the original holder of the
notes where one proves that he is a holder in due course and acquired the
notes for value long before maturity without knowledge of any infirmity in
the notes until after he had acquired them. Neal v. Wilson County Bank, 83
Colo. 118, 263 P. 18 (1927).</T>
   <P></P>
   <T>
    <B>When duty to inquire as to defenses exists.</B> Where an instrument is
regular on its face there is no duty on the part of a check cashing service to
inquire as to possible defenses, unless circumstances of which the holder in
due course has knowledge are of such a nature that the failure to inquire
reveals a deliberate desire to evade knowledge because of a fear that
investigation would disclose the existence of a defense. Money Mart Check
Cashing Ctr., Inc. v. Epicycle Corp., 667 P.2d 1372 (Colo. 1983).</T>
   <P></P>
   <T>
    <B>The defense of fraudulent inducement is unavailable against a holder in
due course</B> and summary judgment was properly entered for holder of note.
Stotler v. Geibank Indus. Bank, 827 P.2d 608 (Colo. App. 1992).</T>
   <P></P>
   <T>
    <B>Maker's claim in her affidavit that she was deceived as to the nature of
the document</B> when she signed it is akin to asserting a claim of fraud in
the factum and is a real defense which, if proved, defeats the rights of
holder to collect under the note. Stotler v. Geibank Indus. Bank, 827 P.2d 608
(Colo. App. 1992).</T>
   <P></P>
   <T>
    <B>Purported maker may raise forgery as a defense</B> to an obligation on an
instrument held by a party claiming holder-in-due-course status. Liberty Mortg. Corp. v.
Fiscus, 2016 CO 31, 379 P.3d 278.</T>
   <P></P>
   <T>
    <B>Failure of a seller of land in a development to timely provide a HUD
report</B> to the buyer and the forgery of a buyer's signature can, in certain
circumstances, provide a defense on a note against an assignee who might
otherwise be a holder in due course. Stotler v. Geibank Indus. Bank, 827 P.2d
608 (Colo. App. 1992).</T>
   <P></P>
   <T>
    <B>If the signers on a note are able to prove close connectedness</B> between
the original payee of the note and an assignee thereof, then such relationship
effectively invalidates the assignee's claim to a holder in due course status
and allows the defenses available against the payee also to be asserted against
the assignee. Stotler v. Geibank Indus. Bank, 827 P.2d 608 (Colo. App. 1992).
<AN-SUB>B.<N></N>Duress.</AN-SUB>
    <ANNO-TEXT>
     <T>
      <B>Threat of sending husband to penitentiary is duress.</B> Where a wife,
who is old and in poor health, executes a note under a threat to send her
husband, who is even older than she, to the penitentiary, there is duress
which voids the note; and such duress is a continuing one which is not
waived by the execution of a renewal of such note. Union Nat'l Bank v.
Wright, 79 Colo. 574, 247 P. 453 (1926).</T>
     <P></P>
     <T>
      <B>Refusal to release deed of trust is not duress.</B> The declaration of a
creditor that he would not release a deed of trust on a debtor's property
unless the debtor signed a promissory note does not constitute duress in law.
Marquart v. Clark, 109 Colo. 62, 121 P.2d 885 (1942).
<AN-SUB>C.<N></N>Illegality.</AN-SUB>
      <ANNO-TEXT>
       <T>
        <B>Defense based on gaming is good.</B> No assignment of any negotiable paper
where the whole or any part of the consideration thereof arises out of any
gaming transaction offsets the statutory defense of the person executing such,
as it is absolutely null and void, even in the hands of an innocent purchaser
for value. W. Nat'l Bank v. State Bank, 18 Colo. App. 128, 70 P. 439
(1902).</T>
       <P></P>
       <T>
        <B>One indorsing and assigning a negotiable instrument in another
state in payment of a gambling loss</B> cannot defend an action on such
as against an innocent purchaser for value before maturity notwithstanding
the gaming statute where the law which prevails in the state where the
assignment was made permits such to be good in the hands of an innocent
purchaser, provided the law of the state concerned is not so shocking to
the moral sense of the community so as to make an exception to the rule
that in suits on contracts the "lex loci" controls. Sullivan v.
German Nat'l Bank, 18 Colo. App. 99, 70 P. 162 (1902).
<AN-SUB>D.<N></N>Misrepresentation.</AN-SUB>
        <ANNO-TEXT>
         <T>
          <B>Answer alleging fraud states a defense.</B> In an action upon an accepted
bill of exchange by an indorsee thereof, an answer setting forth fraud on the
part of the drawer and payee and that the indorsee is not a holder in good
faith but a mere agent of the drawer for collection states a defense. Johnson
County Sav. Bank v. Gregg, 51 Colo. 358, 117 P. 1003 (1911).</T>
         <P></P>
         <T>
          <B>Which is a jury question.</B> The issue whether a note was induced by fraud
is a question for the jury. Atkinson v. Englewood State Bank, 141 Colo. 436,
348 P.2d 702 (1960).</T>
         <P></P>
         <T>
          <B>In an action on a renewal note where the defense is fraudulent
representations</B> in procurement of the original note, the renewal note
itself is evidence tending to show waiver of the fraud, but it still must
be shown that the note was renewed with the intention of waiving the fraud.
First Nat'l Bank v. Navins, 70 Colo. 491, 202 P. 702 (1921).</T>
         <P></P>
         <T>
          <B>Fraud held not a defense as against holder in due course.</B> See
Metro. State Bank v. McNutt, 73 Colo. 291, 215 P. 151 (1923);

  <ANNO-TEXT>
   <T>
    <B>Law reviews.</B> For note, "Conditional Delivery of Negotiable
Instruments in Colorado", see 13 Rocky Mt. L. Rev. 248 (1941).</T>
   <P></P>
   <T>
    <B>Ordinarily a promissory note is prima facie evidence of an obligation</B>
enforceable as to its legal import, but while in the hands of the payee,
the way is always open to the maker to prove circumstances showing that it
never was made or delivered with the intention that it should be binding at
all events; and he may not be foreclosed from establishing, if he can, that
in effect it was no contract at all. McCaffrey v. Mitchell, 98 Colo. 467,
56 P.2d 926, 57 P.2d 900 (1936).</T>
   <P></P>
   <T>
    <B>This section permits the payor of a note to show that he delivered
it conditionally or for a special purpose</B> only, and not for the purpose
of transferring the property in the instrument, where the note is in the
hands of the original payee who brings suit on it. Divine v. W. Slope
Fruit Growers' Ass'n, 27 Colo. App. 368, 149 P. 841 (1915).</T>
   <P></P>
   <T>
    <B>As between the immediate parties to a promissory note,</B> delivery may
be shown to be conditional or for a special purpose. Wheelock v. Hondius,
74 Colo. 400, 222 P. 404 (1924); Rock River Inv. Co. v. Mtn. Fin.
Corp., 94 Colo. 539, 31 P.2d 914 (1934).</T>
   <P></P>
   <T>
    <B>Delivery may be shown by oral testimony.</B> Wheelock v. Hondius, 74 Colo.
400, 222 P. 404 (1924); Rock River Inv. Co. v. Mtn. Fin. Corp., 94 Colo.
539, 31 P.2d 914 (1934).</T>
   <P></P>
   <T>
    <B>Since the parol evidence rule permits</B> the reception of oral testimony
of a contemporaneous oral agreement to show conditional delivery. Wheelock
v. Hondius, 74 Colo. 400, 222 P. 404 (1924).</T>
   <P></P>
   <T>
    <B>There is nothing in the negotiable instrument law, nor in the
statute of frauds,</B> that requires a contract of conditional delivery to be
in writing; this fact being so, it of course may rest in parol. Norman v.
McCarthy, 56 Colo. 290, 138 P. 28 (1914).</T>
   <P></P>
   <T>
    <B>Parol evidence has not the effect to contradict or vary the terms of a
writing,</B> but merely shows the want of an element essential to its
character as a contract -- to wit, unconditional delivery. Norman v.
McCarthy, 56 Colo. 290, 138 P. 28 (1914); Denison Clay Co. v. Pennock,
95 Colo. 20, 32 P.2d 189 (1934).</T>
   <P></P>
   <T>
    <B>Parol evidence has not the effect to show that note is not to be paid at
all.</B> See Wheelock v. Hondius, 74 Colo. 400, 222 P. 404 (1924); Denver Indus.
Corp. v. Kesselring, 90 Colo. 295, 8 P.2d 767 (1932).</T>
   <P></P>
   <T>
    <B>The oral agreement constituting delivery must be contemporaneous</B>
with, and not prior to, the physical delivery of the instrument.
Wheelock v. Hondius, 74 Colo. 400, 222 P. 404 (1924); Rock River Inv. Co.
v. Mtn. Fin. Corp., 94 Colo. 539, 31 P.2d 914 (1934). See Hall v.
Farmers' Bank, 74 Colo. 165, 220 P. 237 (1923).</T>
   <P></P>
   <T>
    <B>One who executes a promissory note payable to a principal and
delivers it to his agent</B> cannot defend on the note as to a collateral
agreement with the agent for conditional payment in the absence of showing
authorization of the agent. McIntosh-Huntington Co. v. Rice, 13 Colo. App.
393, 58 P. 358 (1899).</T>
   <P></P>
   <T>
    <B>As burden of proof on asserting party.</B>
That the delivery of a promissory note was conditional must be established
by the party who asserts it when pleaded. Hickman-Lunbeck Grocery Co. v.
Hager, 75 Colo. 554, 227 P. 829 (1924).</T>
   <P></P>
   <T>
    <B>Evidence of entire agreement is admissible.</B> When a transaction
involving the giving of a promissory note is questioned, evidence
disclosing the entire agreement is always admissible. McCaffrey v.
Mitchell, 98 Colo. 467, 56 P.2d 926, 57 P.2d 900 (1936).</T>
   <P></P>
   <T>
    <B>Though defense of conditional delivery cannot be aided by allegations
of want of consideration.</B> Hickman-Lunbeck Grocery Co. v. Hager, 75 Colo.
554, 227 P. 829 (1924).</T>
   <P></P>
   <T>
    <B>Where a defendant who assumed and agreed to pay the promissory note
of another</B> contends that the plaintiff is bound by a contemporaneous oral
agreement as to the time and manner of payment so as to bring the case
within an exception to the parol evidence rule, such a question of
conditional delivery of a written instrument is not within the meaning of
this section which is quite different from the question of the assumption
of the note, and hence the contention is to be rejected. Index Shale Oil
Co. v. Wheeler, 81 Colo. 402, 255 P. 982 (1927).</T>
   <P></P>
   <T>
    <B>Where a promissory note is delivered upon parol condition
that it shall be without effect in certain event,</B> and the event specified
occurs, no action lies thereon by the payee against the maker. Sayre v.
Leonard, 57 Colo. 116, 140 P. 196 (1914).</T>
   <P></P>
   <T>
    <B>Temporary security for a loan.</B>
Where a promissory note is in the hands of the corporation payee, named
therein, the maker may defeat an action thereon by showing under proper
averment that he subscribed the paper solely to enable the corporation to
pledge it temporarily with a bank as security for a loan, that the loan was
in fact made, and the note afterwards restored to the corporation. Divine
v. W. Slope Fruit Growers' Ass'n, 27 Colo. App. 368, 149 P. 841
(1915), modifying Cooper v. German Nat'l Bank, 9 Colo. App. 169,
47 P. 1041 (1897).</T>
   <P></P>
   <T>
    <B>Where a condition has not been performed.</B> In an action upon an
instrument by payee against the drawer, the drawer may, under this section,
show by parol that the instrument was delivered upon a condition which has
not been performed and which has become impossible of performance. Norman
v. McCarthy, 56 Colo. 290, 138 P. 28 (1914).</T>
   <P></P>
   <T>
    <B>Being signed by another.</B> Promissory notes signed and
delivered under an express agreement and condition that they are not to
become obligatory until signed by another person also are void at the
option of the maker in the hands of the original payee, and a "quia
timet" action will lie for delivery up and cancellation of the notes.
Dygert v. Clem, 26 Colo. App. 286, 143 P. 823 (1914).</T>
   <P></P>
   <T>
    <B>Where payment is to be paid from dividends.</B> In an action by an
assignee after maturity, upon a note where a corporation was the payee, a
parol agreement made contemporaneous with the execution of the note to the
effect that the note would be paid from the maker's share in the dividends
of the corporation, and not otherwise, is a complete defense to the
action. George v. Williams, 27 Colo. App. 400, 149 P. 837 (1915).</T>
   <P></P>
   <T>
    <B>Where a bank check is given under condition</B> that drawer
"made collections to pay it", the condition not being fulfilled,
judgment is properly given for defendant. Miller v. Maxwell, 82 Colo. 540,
261 P. 1116 (1927).</T>
   <P></P>
   <T>
    <B>Condition of prescribed purchase for maker gives negotiation
right.</B> The delivery of a note which is conditioned on an agreement that
the payee will use the proceeds thereof in making a prescribed purchase for
the maker carries with it the right of negotiation without which it would
be valueless. Greenless v. Chezik, 68 Colo. 521, 190 P. 667 (1920).</T>
   <P></P>
   <T>
    <B>An indorsee for value can recover against the maker</B> even
though he had knowledge of the conditions of the delivery. Greenless v.
Chezik, 68 Colo. 521, 190 P. 667 (1920).</T>
   <P></P>
   <T>
    <B>Even a purchaser for value cannot take negotiable paper freed
from conditions attached of which he knows.</B> Weicker v. Bromfield, 34
F.2d 377 (10th Cir. 1929).</T>
   <P></P>
   <T>
    <B>Latter special indorsement superseded restrictive indorsement.</B>
Where a depository bank specially indorsed a check to the plaintiff, who
became a holder in his own right, payment by the maker to the plaintiff
was not contrary to a restrictive indorsement "pay any bank",
because the latter special indorsement superseded the restrictive
indorsement and such action by the depository bank was the equivalent of
a constructive cancellation. Thus, any satisfaction to the ensuing holder was
not inconsistent with the terms of the previous restrictive indorsement.
Lamson v. Commercial Credit Corp., 187 Colo. 382, 531 P.2d 966 (1975).</T>

A person taking an

(a)<M>In an action with respect to an instrument, the
authenticity of, and authority to make, each signature on the
instrument is admitted unless specifically denied in the
pleadings. If the validity of a signature is denied in the

the purported signer and the signer is dead or incompetent at the
time of trial of the issue of validity of the signature. If an
action to enforce the instrument is brought against a person as

   <T>
    <B>A holder is entitled to sue thereon.</B> A holder of a promissory note is
deemed prima facie to be a holder in due course and entitled to sue thereon.

   <P></P>
   <T>
    <B>A holder is entitled to recover.</B> A plaintiff, being holder of a note in
his possession, is entitled to have it admitted in evidence, establishing a
prima facie right to recover thereon. Myrick v. Garcia, 138 Colo. 298, 332
P.2d 900 (1958).</T>
   <P></P>
   <T>
    <B>Whether a promissory note is negotiable or not is immaterial,</B> as the same
result would obtain, a holder of an instrument being entitled to sue thereon as
the prima facie owner. Myrick v. Garcia, 138 Colo. 298, 332 P.2d 900 (1958).</T>
   <P></P>
   <T>
    <B>Assignee of negotiable instrument suing thereon need not plead
specific facts</B> from which his assignor derives the status of a holder in
due course. Blake v. Samuelson, 34 Colo. App. 183, 524 P.2d 624 (1974).</T>
   <P></P>
   <T>
    <B>A holder is entitled to the presumption of due course holding until</B> the
maker succeeds in showing a defense. Atkinson v. Englewood
State Bank, 141 Colo. 436, 348 P.2d 702 (1960).</T>
   <P></P>
   <T>
    <B>Where the answer of the maker denies that the holder is the owner</B>
of the note sued upon, such answer merely has the effect of putting this

    <B>Where the officers of a corporation are given full power and authority</B> to

unprofitable; even if loans were not originally authorized, they are ratified
by acceptance of the benefits. Sec. Sav. &amp; Loan Ass'n v. Colo. Real

    <B>It is error to require lender to show express authority.</B> A court errs
when it rules that the lender must show, through the corporation's articles,
bylaws, or minutes, express authority for such loans from the corporation or
its board, inasmuch as the application of the doctrine of estoppel has kept
pace with the rapid development of corporate enterprise, so that, while ancient
rules regarding limits upon powers of officers of corporations have not been
abrogated, they are conclusively presumed to have been complied with or
compliance to have been waived by the corporation where justice so requires.

   <T>
    <B>Where a promissory note, blank as to the rate of interest</B> and the time
from which interest is to be computed, is subscribed by the maker, as well as
the sureties, and delivered by the maker to the payee, who, without authority
of the sureties, fills the blanks and advances money thereon to the maker, the

avoided. Ayres v. Walker, 54 Colo. 571, 131 P. 384
(1913).</T>
   <P></P>
   <T>
    <B>Reason for rule.</B> This is an old and wise provision of the law, and the
reason for it is apparent when we consider the absoluteness of custody and
control by the payee or holder and the utter helplessness to prevent an
alteration in the case of the maker in that respect. And so the law has
provided as a penalty, not only of criminal liability, but a forfeiture and
cancellation of the obligation in its entirety. Ayres v. Walker, 54 Colo. 571,

The following annotations include cases decided under former provisions
similar to this section.</T>
   <P></P>
   <T>
    <B>Acceptance of a bill at common law and under this section is</B> merely the
signification by the drawee of his assent to the order of the drawer. The
legal meaning of an acceptance is that the acceptor engages to pay the
instrument according to the tenor of his acceptance; in other words, it is a
promise to pay. Van Buskirk v. State Bank, 35 Colo. 142, 83 P. 778 (1905).</T>
   <P></P>
   <T>
    <B>An agreement in writing to honor a draft is sufficient</B> to create
liability to a bank which in reliance thereon is the assignee for value of the
draft. Posey v. Denver Nat'l Bank, 24 Colo. 199, 49 P. 282 (1897).</T>
   <P></P>
   <T>
    <B>A drawer may recover of an acceptor upon a verbal acceptance,</B> whether
the
drawer's funds are in the acceptor's hands upon acceptance or later. Durkee v.
Conklin, 13 Colo. App. 313, 57 P. 486 (1899).</T>
   <P></P>
   <T>
    <B>Such acceptance is outside the statute of frauds</B> because it is only a
promise to pay another's funds on his order. Durkee v. Conklin, 13 Colo. App.
313, 57 P. 486 (1899).</T>
   <P></P>
   <T>
    <B>Drawee may be estopped by conduct to assert that acceptance was not in
writing.</B> Mumm v. Taylor, 121 Colo. 157, 213 P.2d 836 (1950).</T>
   <P></P>
   <T>
    <B>Section applies to checks.</B> Though a check need not be presented for
acceptance in order to render the parties thereto liable, still the check
itself does not operate as an assignment of any part of the fund to the credit
of the drawer with the bank and the drawee bank is not liable to the holder,
unless and until it accepts or certifies the check, and, except as otherwise
provided all provisions applicable to a bill of exchange payable on demand
apply to a check. Consequently, as no contrary provision for the acceptance of
or promise to pay a check has been made, the provision applicable to a bill of
exchange (i.e., draft) that acceptance or certification when made must be in
writing applies also to a check. Van Buskirk v. State Bank, 35 Colo. 142, 83
P. 778 (1905).</T>
   <P></P>
   <T>
    <B>Where upon inquiry by correspondent bank as agent of the drawer, the bank
agrees</B> to honor check, such assent constitutes an acceptance; and upon
dishonor, drawer can maintain an action for breach of the agreement.
Sigel-Campion Live Stock Co. v. Davis, 69 Colo. 511, 194 P. 468 (1921). See
Gambrill v. Brown Hotel Co., 11 Colo. App. 529, 54 P. 1025 (1898).</T>
   <P></P>
   <T>
    <B>Drawer discharged by acceptance.</B> Where the payee of a bank check
procures acceptance by the bank upon which it is drawn, upon which acceptance
he obtains judgment against the latter, he cannot pursue a further remedy
against the drawer of the check in the same matter, there being as to such
drawer a positive statutory discharge. Roberts v. Sch. Dist. No. 1, 99 Colo.

   <P></P>
   <T>
    <B>The burden of avoidance is on maker.</B> Where the maker makes no claim of

   <P></P>
   <T>
    <B>Presumption does not apply where fiduciary relationship.</B> The general
presumption of liability of maker of promissory notes is over come by the
specific presumption arising out of where there is a fiduciary relationship, in
which case the claimant must overcome, by evidence, the presumption of undue
influence with which the transaction is tainted because of the existence of the
fiduciary relationship. Arnold v. Abernethy, 134 Colo. 573, 307 P.2d 1106
(1957).</T>
   <P></P>
   <T>
    <B>The thoughts and purposes of the maker, not disclosed at the execution of
the contract, may not be given</B> to the jury in an attempt to show that the
instrument means something other than what is shown on its face. McCaffrey v.
Mitchell, 98 Colo. 467, 56 P.2d 926, 57 P.2d 900 (1936).</T>
   <P></P>
   <T>
    <B>Maker cannot be heard to say that payee committed an illegal act in taking
instrument, or had no authority to dispose of it,</B> in the usual course of
business, because, by its execution and delivery, he is precluded from raising
any of these questions as against purchasers who obtained it for value before
maturity without notice of the facts upon which he relies to defeat it. McMann

   <P></P>
   <T>
    <B>The equities that may exist between payees</B> governing the division of
funds paid pursuant to a commercial promissory note are none of the makers'
concern, as they must simply pay the note according to its tenor to the holder
at maturity. Reese v. Lietzan, 160 Colo. 253, 419 P.2d 959 (1966).</T>
   <P></P>
   <T>
    <B>Who is deemed the prima facie owner.</B> Where an action is brought on a
promissory note payable to the maker and indorsed in blank by him with a
guarantee of payment, one having possession of the note is prima facie owner
thereof and can recover against the maker as such. Byers v. Bellan-Price Co.,
10 Colo. App. 74, 50 P. 368 (1897).</T>
   <P></P>
   <T>
    <B>The maker of a promissory note may plead that another is the real owner</B>
thereof, that the action is prosecuted for his benefit, and set upon an
indebtedness due and owing by such party in interest to him. Bank of Bromfield

   <P></P>
   <T>
    <B>Including of bank holding municipal bonds.</B> Where a municipality issues
bonds, payable at the option of the holder at a bank, the failure of a holder
to present the bonds for payment at such bank does not relieve the municipality
as maker, although the bonds and payment fund have been forwarded to the bank
by the municipality. Employers Mut. Ins. Co. v. Bd. of County Comm'rs, 102

    <B>Where a bank indorses a note over to its president for collection,</B> but he

note without further indorsement to a third party for a valuable consideration,
the bank is liable as an indorser without further indorsement. Moore v. First
Nat'l Bank, 38 Colo. 336, 88 P. 385 (1907).</T>
   <P></P>
   <T>
    <B>Where a mortgage assigns "with the notes therein described without

of protest, he is not entitled to demand and notice, with his ability,
therefore, being governed by this section where he is to pay the holder if the
maker does not. Sproul v. Monteith, 66 Colo. 541, 185 P. 270 (1919).</T>

    <B>Annotator's note.</B> The following annotations include cases decided under
former
provisions similar to this section.</T>
   <P></P>
   <T>
    <B>Under the N.I.L. an accommodation party
was one who</B> signed the instrument as maker,
drawer, acceptor, or indorser, without receiving
value therefor, and for the purpose of
lending his name to some other person; such
person was liable on the instrument to a
holder for value, though the holder, at the
time of taking the instrument, knew him to be
only an accommodation party. Foothills Holding
Corp. v. Tulsa Rig, Reel &amp; Mfg. Co., 155
Colo. 232, 393 P.2d 749 (1964).</T>
   <P></P>
   <T>
    <B>One who signs a promissory note as surety is primarily liable</B> on the
instrument.
Hall v. Farmers' Bank, 74 Colo. 165, 220 P. 237 (1923).</T>
   <P></P>
   <T>
    <B>As distinguished from secondary liability.</B> So far as concerns the holder of
a note,
the liability of a surety is a primary, as distinguished from a secondary, liability. Hall v.
Farmers'
Bank, 74 Colo. 165, 220 P. 237 (1923) (decided under repealed laws antecedent to CSA,
C.
112, § 192, negotiable instruments law).</T>
   <P></P>
   <T>
    <B>If one is an accommodation party lending his name,</B> he is primarily liable to
the
holder, though he is merely a surety. Foothills Holding Corp. v. Tulsa Rig, Reel &amp;
Mfg.
Co.,
155 Colo. 232, 393 P.2d 749 (1964).</T>
   <P></P>
   <T>
    <B>Where loan would not have been made save
for third person's indorsement.</B> Where a third
person writes his name on the back of a note
before delivery to the payee, and without
such indorsement the loan evidenced by the
note would not have been made, such third
person is an original promisor with a primary
obligation in an action by the payee. Court
Valhalla No. 16 Foresters of Am. v.
Olson, 14 Colo. App. 243, 59 P. 883 (1900).</T>
   <P></P>
   <T>
    <B>Where maker of note obtains extension
of obligation to repay a bank as result of an
accommodation party's indorsement</B> of a
renewal note, the mere fact that
accommodation indorsement is made at
request of bank does not alter maker's position
as beneficiary of the accommodation
indorsement and as the party accommodated
in transaction; and the accommodation party
is liable as an accommodation indorser to a
holder of the renewal note. State Bank v.
Owens, 31 Colo. App. 351, 502 P.2d 965 (1972).</T>
   <P></P>
   <T>
    <B>Liability of party signing note as individual, without qualifying
designation.</B> Where
parties sign a note as individuals, without any qualifying designations, they are
individually liable
as makers, and not as accommodation parties. Rink-A-Dinks v. TNT Motorcycles, Inc.,
655 P.2d
431 (Colo. App. 1982).</T>
   <P></P>
   <T>
    <B>One who executes a note for the purpose of
obtaining money for another</B> and who receives
no part of the fund for his personal use, the
entire amount going to the accommodated
party, is an accommodation party. McGhee
Inv. Co. v. Kirsher, 71 Colo. 137, 204 P. 891
(1922). See Fleming v. Gamble, 37 F.2d 72 (10th Cir. 1929).</T>
   <P></P>
   <T>
    <B>The term "value" as used in this section
relates to</B> value for the negotiable instrument
and not to the loan of the name by way of
accommodation. McGhee Inv. Co. v. Kirsher,
71 Colo. 137, 204 P. 891 (1922).</T>
   <P></P>
   <T>
    <B>Moreover, comaker's answer that he
received nothing of value for signing is no
defense.</B> In an action against several makers of
a promissory note, the answer of one of them
that he received nothing of value for signing it
does not constitute a defense, because the
consideration may have been received by his
comakers. Bloom v. State Bank, 75 Colo. 28,
223 P. 750 (1924).</T>
   <P></P>
   <T>
    <B>One who indorses a note prior to
delivery: "Demand notice and protest waived.
Payment guaranteed" is a surety</B> or
accommodation indorser within the meaning
of this section. Winton v. Sullivan, 104 Colo.
450, 91 P.2d 996 (1939) (decided also under
repealed CSA, C. 112, § 192, negotiable
instruments law).</T>
   <P></P>
   <T>
    <B>Even if it is conceded that a party is an
accommodation maker, that fact does not do
away with his responsibility</B> for payment as
fixed by this section. Civic Fin. Co. v.
Meintzer, 137 Colo. 572, 328 P.2d 379 (1958).</T>

   <P></P>
   <T>
    <B>Also, upon notes which one signs individually
as an accommodation maker at the lender's
request in order to obtain loans for a corporation</B>
of which he is an officer and principal
stockholder, he is liable jointly and severally
with the corporation for all amounts due upon
the notes. Sec. Sav. &amp; Loan Ass'n v.
Colo. Real Estate Dev., Inc., 163 Colo.
155, 429 P.2d 288 (1967).</T>
   <P></P>
   <T>
    <B>Stockholders who execute a promissory
note to raise corporate funds</B> cannot claim to
be accommodation makers; rather, they are
principal makers upon a sufficient consideration.

48 P. 507 (1897).</T>
   <P></P>
   <T>
    <B>An accommodation maker may proceed against principal maker.</B> An
accommodation maker or surety on a promissory note against whom a judgment has
been rendered may, without making payment himself, proceed in equity against the
principal
makers, or their estate, for payment of the note so as to exonerate the surety.

to contribution.</B> Owens v. Greenlee, 68 Colo. 114, 188 P. 721 (1920).</T>
   <P></P>

    <B>Though neither the law merchant nor the

   <P></P>
   <T>
    <B>Guarantor's liability is separate and independent of and not affected by
validity of stipulated settlement agreement.</B> Defendants' claim that the
settlement agreement was based upon a mistake of fact and should be set aside
had no bearing on the validity of the unconditional guaranty. First Interstate
Bank v. Colcott Partners, 833 P.2d 876 (Colo. App. 1992).</T>
   <P></P>
   <T>
    <B>Guarantor's liability is the same as that of principal debtor</B> where
there is no language to the contrary in the guaranty. First Interstate Bank
v. Colcott Partners, 833 P.2d 876 (Colo. App. 1992).</T>
   <P></P>
   <T>
    <B>Where a contract of guaranty provides that notice of default of the principal
debtor must
be given</B> to the guarantor, such notice must be given for the guarantor to be liable.
W.
States Leasing Co. v. Adturn, Inc., 31 Colo. App. 256, 500 P.2d 1190 (1972).</T>
   <P></P>
   <T>
    <B>However, where an unambiguous absolute
guaranty is silent as to notice</B> and the maximum
amount guaranteed is determinable at
the time the guarantee is entered into, there is
no basis to imply a requirement of notice.
W. States Leasing Co. v. Adturn, Inc.,
31 Colo. App. 256, 500 P.2d 1190 (1972).</T>
   <P></P>
   <T>
    <B>It is error to resort to another instrument
for any limiting conditions.</B> Where separate
instrument guarantying lease payment is
unambiguous, it is error to resort to the language
of the lease to construe the guaranty as
to any limiting conditions. W. States
Leasing Co. v. Adturn, Inc., 31 Colo. App. 256,
500 P.2d 1190 (1972).</T>

    <B>Same person may be both guarantor and indorser.</B> Winton v. Sullivan, 104
Colo.
450, 91 P.2d 996 (1939).</T>
   <P></P>
   <T>
    <B>A guarantor of a note is not an indorser within
the meaning of that term as used in a warrant of attorney</B>
in such note; hence, a judgment rendered upon confession
thereunder is void for lack of jurisdiction of the person.
Sidwell v. First Nat'l Bank, 76 Colo. 547, 233 P. 153 (1925) (decided under
repealed laws antecedent to CSA, C. 112, § 29, negotiable instruments law).</T>
   <P></P>
   <T>
    <B>Guarantor is secondarily liable.</B> For the one who after the execution and
delivery
of a promissory note signs it as guarantor to satisfy a subsequent purchaser, his liability
thereon is secondary and not primary. Cobbey v. Peterson, 89 Colo. 350, 3 P.2d 298

   <P></P>
   <T>
    <B>Under subsection (c), the lack of qualifying words on promissory note cannot
defeat accommodation party status.</B> Accordingly, because no such qualifiers are
present, court looks for evidence showing that individual defendants received a direct
benefit from the value given for promissory note. Bd. of Cty. Comm'rs v. Sportsmen's
Ranch,
271 P.3d 562 (Colo. App. 2011).</T>
   <P></P>
   <T>
    <B>Because evidence does not show that individual defendants received a direct
benefit from either original loan or subsequent promissory note, court of appeals must
overturn jury's finding that defendants did not sign as accommodation parties.</B> Here,
individual defendants were accommodation parties. As accommodation parties,
individual
defendants were entitled to enforce note and their acquisition of the note did not
extinguish
underlying deed of trust. Bd. of Cty. Comm'rs v. Sportsmen's Ranch, 271 P.3d 562

There is a conversion of a negotiable instrument when any person unlawfully

   <P></P>
   <T>While a showing of fraud, misrepresentation, or mistake may constitute a
defense to payment, it does not establish the right to immediate possession, a
necessary prerequisite to establishing a claim for conversion. Commercial

   <P></P>
   <T>Bank's wrongful deposit of corporate checks into treasurer's personal
account, absent commercially reasonable inquiries as to the authority of
the treasurer to deposit such checks, constitutes conversion. Central
Inc. v. Cache Nat'l Bank, 748 P.2d 351 (Colo. App. 1987).</T>
   <P></P>
   <T>If payment by a collecting or depository bank occurs on a check
with no indorsement or with a missing endorsement,
it is the legal equivalent of payment on a forged indorsement,
which constitutes conversion. Central

    <B>Former version of subsection (1) not all inclusive.</B> The three listed

199 Colo. 497, 612 P.2d 70 (1980).</T>
   <P></P>
   <T>Where undisputed evidence established that collecting bank failed to make
inquiries as to the authority of a corporate treasurer to deposit checks
payable to corporation into the personal account of the
treasurer, the court properly determined that the bank had not acted
according to reasonable commercial standards and was not entitled to take
advantage of the statutory defenses. Central Inc. v. Cache Nat'l

    <B>Notice to one does not constitute notice to
all.</B> In an action on a promissory note, notice
of nonpayment to one defendant does not
constitute notice to the others, and the
contention that he is the general agent of his
codefendants for the purpose of receiving
notice is without merit. Bieser v. Irwin, 101

    <B>Where stolen check bore a 1971 date and was not cashed until 1973,</B>
when the time for presentment had long since passed, the lack of timely
presentment would not have destroyed its negotiability as the negotiability
of an instrument is not affected by the fact that it is undated, antedated, or
postdated. Thus, the stolen check indorsed by accused falls squarely within
the terms of the forgery statute under which he was convicted.

    <B>Unless negotiable paper is sent by the holder

    <B>Where a promissory note payable at a

    <B>A bondholder is not required to present</B> a

    <B>When the guarantor of a promissory note

    <B>The guarantor may sue maker.</B> The discharge of
the contract of guaranty by the guarantor
does not extinguish or satisfy the obligation to

it is universally held that upon payment

secondarily liable, he becomes entitled to the
possession of such note and may maintain an
action upon it against the maker. Cone v.

by so doing it awards relief ordinarily cognizable

The following annotations include cases decided under former provisions

   <P></P>
   <T>
    <B>Section does not apply where note is
delivered.</B> This section, providing that the
release of a promissory note must be in writing,
has no application to a case where the
note is delivered to the maker by an authorized
agent of the holder. Kitts v. Hill, 89
Colo. 186, 300 P. 610 (1931).</T>
   <P></P>
   <T>
    <B>This section only applies if the defense of renunciation is asserted,</B>
and does not apply when an assertion is made that
a party has waived its right to receive interest under the terms
of a promissory note.

   <P></P>
   <T>
    <B>This section provides that the renunciation
of rights in a negotiable instrument must
be</B> in writing or the instrument itself must be
delivered up to the person liable thereon.

   <P></P>
   <T>
    <B>"Renunciation" is</B> the unilateral act of the
holder usually without consideration,
whereby he expresses the intention of abandoning
his rights on the instrument or against
one or more parties thereto. Berta v. Rocchio,
149 Colo. 325, 369 P.2d 51 (1962).</T>
   <P></P>
   <T>
    <B>Despite the language of this section, an intent to discharge a party</B>
is required, and consideration of evidence of intent of the parties is
proper in determining the issue of discharge. Columbia Sav. and Loan Ass'n
v. Zelinger, 794 P.2d 231 (Colo. 1990).</T>
   <P></P>
   <T>
    <B>Where the affirmative defense of
renunciation is asserted, the burden is upon
those</B> asserting the defense to produce a written
renunciation or to prove that the note has
been delivered up to them. Adams v. White,
173 Colo. 51, 476 P.2d 36 (1970).</T>
   <P></P>
   <T>
    <B>Without delivery of a note to the maker,
the writing of the word "paid"</B> across the face
of the note by payee and the signing of his
name thereto does not operate to discharge
the liability of the maker. Wittman v. Pickens,
33 Colo. 484, 81 P. 299 (1905).</T>
   <P></P>
   <T>
    <B>Liability is discharged by cancellation and
return.</B> The liability of the payee of a promissory
note who indorses when transferring it
to another is discharged by the acts of the
indorsee in cancelling and returning it to the
maker and accepting in lieu thereof other
evidences of indebtedness. Tomkins v.
Tomkins, 78 Colo. 574, 243 P. 632 (1926).</T>

extension caused loss to the indorser or accommodation party with
respect to the right of recourse.</M>
  </T>

  <T>(d)<M>If a person entitled to enforce an instrument agrees,

modification discharges the obligation of an indorser or
accommodation party having a right of recourse against the person
whose obligation is modified to the extent the modification causes
loss to the indorser or accommodation party with respect to the
right of recourse. The loss suffered by the indorser or
accommodation party as a result of the modification is equal to
the amount of the right of recourse unless the person enforcing
the instrument proves that no loss was caused by the modification
or that the loss caused by the modification was an amount less
than the amount of the right of recourse.</M>

having a right of recourse against the obligor is discharged to
the extent of the impairment. The value of an interest in
collateral is impaired to the extent (i) the value of the interest
is reduced to an amount less than the amount of the right of
recourse of the party asserting discharge, or (ii) the reduction
in value of the interest causes an increase in the amount by which
the amount of the right of recourse exceeds the value of the
interest. The burden of proving impairment is on the party
asserting discharge.</M>
  </T>
  <P N="(f)"></P>
  <T>(f)<M>If the obligation of a party is secured by an interest
in collateral not provided by an accommodation party and a person
entitled to enforce the instrument impairs the value of the

and severally liable with respect to the secured obligation is
discharged to the extent the impairment causes the party asserting
discharge to pay more than that party would have been obliged to
pay, taking into account rights of contribution, if impairment had
not occurred. If the party asserting discharge is an
accommodation party not entitled to discharge under subsection (e)
of this section, the party is deemed to have a right to
contribution based on joint and several liability rather than a
right to reimbursement. The burden of proving impairment is on
the party asserting discharge.</M>

  <P N="(g)"></P>
  <T>(g)<M>Under subsection (e) or (f) of this
section, impairing value of an interest in collateral includes (i) failure to obtain
or maintain perfection or recordation of the interest in
collateral, (ii) release of collateral without substitution of
collateral of equal value, (iii) failure to perform a duty to
preserve the value of collateral owed, under article 9 or other
law, to a debtor or surety or other person secondarily liable, or
(iv) failure to comply with applicable law in disposing of
collateral.</M>

party asserting discharge consents to the event or conduct that
is the basis of the discharge, or (ii) the instrument or a

under this section either specifically or by general language
indicating that parties waive defenses based on suretyship or

    <B>Nor does a request by such an

   <P></P>
   <T>
    <B>Also, an extension of time of payment of a

Am. Medical &amp; Dental Ass'n v. Grant,
87 Colo. 183, 285 P. 1099 (1930).</T>
   <P></P>
   <T>
    <B>A holder cannot arbitrarily extend time
for payment.</B> Stipulation in a promissory note
that makers and indorsers agree to any extension
of time of payment before, at, or after
maturity does not mean that the holder can
arbitrarily extend the time of payment. Am.
Medical &amp; Dental Ass'n v. Grant, 87
Colo. 183, 285 P. 1099 (1930).</T>
   <P></P>
   <T>
    <B>As between the maker and payee of a

payment until a copy of patent to land can be
obtained is not invalid as an indefinite extension.
Drake v. Pueblo Nat'l Bank, 44 Colo. 49, 96 P. 999 (1908).</T>
   <P></P>
   <T>
    <B>Though such does not apply to a surety.</B>
A surety is primarily liable, and one primarily
liable thereunder is not released from liability
by an extension of the time of payment to the
principal maker without the surety's consent.
Only the person who can be released by a
binding agreement extending time is one
"secondarily" liable and as a surety is not
"secondarily", but "primarily", liable, he is
not released by such extension. Hall v. Farmers'
Bank, 74 Colo. 165, 220 P. 237 (1923).</T>
   <P></P>
   <T>
    <B>Where the holder of a note obtains control
of property which a surety on the note is
entitled</B> to have applied to the payment of the
note, thereby preventing the surety from
being subrogated to the holder's rights in such
property, the surety is released from liability.
Crosby v. Woodbury, 37 Colo. 1, 89 P. 34 (1906).</T>
   <P></P>
   <T>
    <B>Instructions merely stating section must
include interpretation.</B> Where instruction on
impairment of recourse or of collateral is correct
statement of law relative to defendant's
defense, it is error not to include interpretation
of this highly technical statute in
instructions to aid jury in applying statute to
facts of case. Pueblo Bank &amp; Trust Co. v.
McMartin, 31 Colo. App. 546, 506 P.2d 759 (1972).</T>
   <P></P>
   <T>
    <B>Subsection (2) (under former law) does not require notification and consent
as a
prerequisite to an express reservation of rights.</B> Although plaintiff
discharged defendants in assumption agreement, it expressly reserved its
rights against them.
Therefore the defendants remained liable on their obligation to
plaintiff. Matthews v. Saleen, 812 P.2d 1186 (Colo. App. 1991).</T>
   <P></P>
   <T>
    <B>Failure to object to an increase in risk,</B> the terms of which were never
explained, cannot be deemed a consent to impairment of collateral. Haberl v.
Bigelow, 855 P.2d 1368 (Colo. 1993).</T>
   <P></P>
   <T>
    <B>Under former § 4-3-606, a prior, express consent provision in an
instrument
waives either a surety or a co-maker's right to claim a discharge of obligations based
upon later modifications to the obligation.</B> Crown Life Ins. Co. v. Haag Ltd.

    <B>Breach of duties of "good faith" and "ordinary care".</B>
In transferring checks to a third party, a bank breaches its duty of
"good faith" only if it deals dishonestly in transferring checks, and breaches
its duty of "ordinary care" only if a reasonable holder in the bank's
position, in the exercise of ordinary care, would not
have transferred the checks. Commercial Credit Corp.

    <B>Customer's failure to prove loss.</B> A partnership that could not meet its
burden of proving that a bank's improper payment of drafts drawn on the
partnership's account caused the partnership to
suffer a loss could not have its account recredited for the amount of the draft
payments. Isaac v. Am. Heritage Bank &amp; Trust Co., 675 P.2d 742 (Colo.

clearly appears and before the time that a
settlement given by a collecting bank for an item is or becomes final, the bank,
with respect to the item, is an agent or subagent of the owner of
the item and any settlement given for the item is provisional.
This provision applies regardless of the form of indorsement or
lack of indorsement and even though credit given for the item is
subject to immediate withdrawal as of right or is in fact
withdrawn; but the continuance of ownership of an item by its
owner and any rights of the owner to proceeds of the item are
subject to rights of a collecting bank such as those resulting
from outstanding advances on the item and rights of
recoupment or setoff. If an item is handled

Where one indorses a check payable to him

money to the account, and the depositor
withdraws the full amount, but subsequently
the foreign payor bank refuses to honor the
check, the depositor is still the owner of the
check, the bank is the agent for collection,
and the credit given for the deposit is only
provisional; therefore, the risk of loss on the

   <P></P>
   <T>
    <B>Liability of indorser where estoppel created.</B> While the
principle that an indorser is liable on his warranty is
correctly stated, the rule has no application when an estoppel
has been created which would preclude plaintiff from obtaining
a refund of the amount paid to defendant. First Nat'l Bank

bank did not in
fact place a statement on the item to be collected, which statement would have
been effective as its customer's indorsement.

   <P></P>
   <T>
    <B>Subsection (1) under former law does not permit depository bank to evade
duties imposed by
§ 4-3-206(3) under former law.</B>
Subsection (1) does not permit a depository bank to evade its duty to act
consistently with restrictive endorsements as provided by § 4-3-206 (3). La
Junta State Bank v. Travis, 727 P.2d 48 (Colo. 1986).</T>
   <P></P>
   <T>The duty to examine a restrictive indorsement and follow its directions may
require a bank to refuse to deposit an item in a particular account if such
conduct would be inconsistent with the
restrictive indorsement, or to investigate rather than accept an item as a
matter of course. La Junta State Bank v. Travis, 727 P.2d 48 (Colo. 1986).</T>
   <P></P>
   <T>
    <B>Subsection (2) under former law not in conflict with requirements of §
4-3-206 (2) under former law.</B>
The clear import of both subsection (2) and § 4-3-206 (2) is that while
intermediary banks and nondepository payor banks may ignore all restrictive
indorsements except those of the bank's immediate
transferor, depository banks may not so ignore restrictive indorsements. La

"Security procedure" means a procedure established by agreement
of a customer and a receiving bank for the purpose of (i) verifying
that a payment order or communication amending or cancelling
a payment order is that of the customer, or (ii) detecting error in
the transmission or the content of the payment order or communication.
A security procedure may require the use of algorithms or
other codes, identifying words or numbers, encryption, callback
procedures, or similar security devices. Comparison of a signature
on a payment order or communication with an authorized specimen
signature of the customer is not by itself a security procedure.</SECTION-TEXT>

number of days for which interest is payable. The applicable
federal funds rate is the average of the federal funds rates published by
the federal reserve bank of New York for each of the days
for which interest is payable divided by three hundred sixty. The federal
funds rate for any day on which a published rate is not available is the
same as the published rate for the next preceding day for which
there is a published rate. If a receiving bank that accepted a
payment order is required to refund payment to the sender of the
order because the funds transfer was not completed, but the failure
to complete was not due to any fault by the bank, the interest
payable is reduced by a percentage equal to the reserve requirement
on deposits of the receiving bank.</M>

    <B>Letter of credit not similar to surety contract.</B>
An analogy between a surety contract and a letter of credit is not well

752 (Colo. 1981).</T>
   <P></P>
   <T>
    <B>But akin to cashier's check.</B>
The letter of credit is closely akin to a cashier's check or other negotiable
instrument issued by a bank. Leney v. Plum Grove Bank, 670 F.2d 878 (10th Cir. 1982).</T>
   <P></P>
   <T>
    <B>Effect of letter of credit on issuing bank.</B>
By issuing a letter of credit, the bank substitutes its credit for that
of its customer. Leney v. Plum Grove Bank, 670 F.2d 878 (10th Cir. 1982).</T>
   <P></P>
   <T>
    <B>One of the uses of credits</B> is to secure performance of a contract
between a bank's customer and a third party. Hyland Hills Metro.
Park &amp; Recreational Dist. v. McCoy Enters., Inc., 38 Colo. App. 23,
554 P.2d 708 (1976).</T>
   <P></P>
   <T>
    <B>Two separate contracts are involved.</B> The bank issuing the letter
of credit is bound by its terms and has no obligation or right to
investigate the performance of the other contract to which the credit
relates. Hyland Hills Metro. Park &amp; Recreational Dist. v. McCoy
Enters., Inc., 38 Colo. App. 23, 554 P.2d 708 (1976).</T>

   <T>
    <B>If printed and written, or typed, provisions of a letter of

   <P></P>
   <T>
    <B>Liability of bank where payment not in accordance with credit terms.</B>
Payment by a bank, if not in accordance with the terms of the credit, would
have rendered the bank liable to the customer. Hyland Hills Metro.
Park &amp; Recreational Dist. v. McCoy Enters., Inc., 38 Colo. App. 23,
554 P.2d 708 (1976).</T>
   <P></P>
   <T>
    <B>Forum for suing out-of-state issuing bank limited.</B>
It is unfair to burden an out-of-state issuing bank with having to defend
litigation over a letter of credit in any state in which the bank could
reasonably expect the credit to be used. Leney v. Plum Grove Bank, 670
F.2d 878 (10th Cir. 1982).</T>
   <P></P>
   <T>
    <B>Bank's obligation held terminated.</B> Where a third party was
seeking payment under the letter of credit because of the bank
customer's failure to construct the tennis courts, it was required
to present its "signed statement dated January 5, 1974, and presented
on that date", setting forth that fact according to the terms of the
letter of credit. Upon its failure to do so, the obligation of the
bank terminated. Hyland Hills Metro. Park &amp; Recreational Dist.
v. McCoy Enters., Inc., 38 Colo. App. 23, 554 P.2d 708 (1976).</T>
   <P></P>
   <T>
    <B>"Guaranty letter of credit"</B> issued by a bank requiring
a documentary demand, and conspicuously stating that it was
a letter of credit, falls squarely within the definition of
letter of credit so that a defendant bank cannot escape its
obligation to honor a demand on it. East Bank v. Dovenmuehle,
Inc., 196 Colo. 422, 589 P.2d 1361 (1978).</T>

"proceeds of a letter of credit" means the cash, check, accepted
draft, or other item of value paid or delivered upon honor or
giving of value by the issuer or any nominated person under the
letter of credit. The term does not include a beneficiary's
drawing rights or documents presented by the beneficiary.</M>
  <P N="(b)"></P>
  <T>(b)<M>A beneficiary may assign its right to part or all of
the proceeds of a letter of credit. The beneficiary may do so
before presentation as a present assignment of its right to
receive proceeds contingent upon its compliance with the terms and
conditions of the letter of credit.</M>
  </T>
  <P N="(c)"></P>
  <T>(c)<M>An issuer or nominated person need not recognize an
assignment of proceeds of a letter of credit until it consents to
the assignment.</M>
  </T>
  <P N="(d)"></P>
  <T>(d)<M>An issuer or nominated person has no obligation to give
or withhold its consent to an assignment of proceeds of a letter
of credit, but consent may not be unreasonably withheld if the
assignee possesses and exhibits the letter of credit and
presentation of the letter of credit is a condition to honor.</M>
  </T>
  <P N="(e)"></P>
  <T>(e)<M>Rights of a transferee beneficiary or nominated person

  <T>(f)<M>Neither the rights recognized by this section between
an assignee and an issuer, transferee beneficiary, or nominated
person nor the issuer's or nominated person's payment of proceeds
to an assignee or a third person affect the rights between the
assignee and any person other than the issuer, transferee
beneficiary, or nominated person. The mode of creating and
perfecting a security interest in or granting an assignment of a
beneficiary's rights to proceeds is governed by article 9 of this
title or other law. Against persons other than the issuer,
transferee beneficiary, or nominated person, the rights and
obligations arising upon the creation of a security interest or
other assignment of a beneficiary's right to proceeds and its
perfection are governed by article 9 of this title or other law.</M>

    <B>Strict compliance with terms of letter of credit is required</B> to maintain
the commercial vitality of the letter of credit device. Colo. Nat'l
Bank v. Bd. of County Comm'rs, 634 P.2d 32 (Colo. 1981).</T>
   <P></P>
   <T>
    <B>Independence of letters of credit to be preserved.</B> The purpose
of the letter of credit requires that the unique feature of the letter of
credit, i.e., their independence from the contract between the customer
and the beneficiary, be preserved by courts. Dovenmuehle, Inc. v. East
Bank, 38 Colo. App. 507, 563 P.2d 24 (1977),
aff'd, 196 Colo. 422, 589 P.2d 1361 (1978).</T>
   <P></P>
   <T>The transactions or contracts underlying the bank's issuance of a letter
of credit have no bearing whatsoever on the bank's primary liability to
the beneficiary of the letter. Bd. of County Comm'rs v. Colo. Nat'l
Bank, 43 Colo. App. 186, 607 P.2d 1010 (1979), aff'd in part and rev'd in
part on other grounds, 634 P.2d 32 (Colo. 1981).</T>
   <P></P>
   <T>
    <B>Effect of letter of credit on issuing bank.</B>
By issuing a letter of credit, the bank substitutes its credit for that
of its customer. Leney v. Plum Grove Bank, 670 F.2d 878 (10th Cir. 1982).</T>
   <P></P>
   <T>
    <B>Letters of credit are actual liabilities of a bank.</B> Bank acted
properly in freezing accounts of beneficiary even though
no demand for payment under letters of
credit issued by bank had been made. Balzano v. United Bank of Denver, 761
P.2d 229 (Colo. App. 1988).</T>
   <P></P>
   <T>
    <B>Letters of credit do not eradicate the contractual latitude
afforded the parties,</B> but are intended to enhance it. Dovenmuehle,
Inc. v. East Bank, 38 Colo. App. 507, 563 P.2d 24 (1977),
aff'd, 196 Colo. 422, 589 P.2d 1361 (1978).</T>
   <P></P>
   <T>Within broad limits, an issuer and the beneficiary may agree that
various conditions be satisfied by documentation prior to payment.
Dovenmuehle, Inc. v. East Bank, 38 Colo. App. 507, 563 P.2d 24 (1977),
aff'd, 196 Colo. 422, 589 P.2d 1361 (1978).</T>
   <P></P>
   <T>
    <B>And contract principles may be considered in deciding
controversies.</B> As a result of the flexibility with which the
issuer and beneficiary may agree to conditions to payment, contract
principles are not necessarily precluded from consideration in
deciding controversies involving letters of credit if the parties
embody them within the terms of the credit. Dovenmuehle, Inc. v.
East Bank, 38 Colo. App. 507, 563 P.2d 24 (1977),
aff'd, 196 Colo. 422, 589 P.2d 1361 (1978).</T>
   <P></P>
   <T>
    <B>Issuer may pay on letter of credit despite notice of irregularity.</B>
The issuer of a letter of credit may, in good faith, honor a draft or demand
for payment notwithstanding notice from its customer that documents are
forged or fraudulent or that there is fraud in the transaction; the issuer
may, however, be enjoined from honoring such drafts or demands for payment.
Colo. Nat'l Bank v. Bd. of County Comm'rs, 634 P.2d 32 (Colo. 1981).</T>
   <P></P>
   <T>
    <B>"Fraud in the transaction",</B> as referred to in subsection (2), must
stem from conduct by the beneficiary of the letter of credit as against
the customer of the bank. Colo. Nat'l Bank v. Bd. of County Comm'rs,
634 P.2d 32 (Colo. 1981).</T>
   <P></P>
   <T>Fraud must be of such an egregious nature as to vitiate the entire underlying
transaction so that the legitimate purposes of the independence of the bank's
obligation would no longer be served. Colo. Nat'l Bank v. Bd. of County
Comm'rs, 634 P.2d 32 (Colo. 1981).</T>
   <P></P>
   <T>
    <B>When issuer confined to stated grounds for dishonor.</B>
An issuer is confined to its stated grounds for dishonor where the statements
have misled the beneficiary who could have cured the defect but relied on
the stated grounds to its injury. Colo. Nat'l Bank v. Bd. of County
Comm'rs, 634 P.2d 32 (Colo. 1981).</T>
   <P></P>
   <T>
    <B>Waiver of grounds for refusal to pay.</B> In cases involving letters
of credit, a refusal to pay by an issuer formally placed on one ground
will be deemed a waiver of all others based on the letter of credit.
Dovenmuehle, Inc. v. East Bank, 38 Colo. App. 507, 563 P.2d 24 (1977),
aff'd, 196 Colo. 422, 589 P.2d 1361 (1978).</T>
   <P></P>
   <T>
    <B>"Guaranty letter of credit"</B> issued by a bank requiring
a documentary demand, and conspicuously stating that it was
a letter of credit, falls squarely within the definition of
letter of credit, so that a defendant bank cannot escape its
obligation to honor a demand on it. East Bank v. Dovenmuehle,
Inc., 196 Colo. 422, 589 P.2d 1361 (1978).</T>
   <P></P>
   <T>
    <B>Standby letters of credit, suretyship and guaranty contracts compared.</B>
Colo. Nat'l Bank v. Bd. of County Comm'rs, 634 P.2d 32 (Colo. 1981).</T>
   <P></P>
   <T>
    <B>Surety contract not similar.</B>
An analogy between a surety contract and a letter of credit is not well
taken. General Ins. Co. of Am. v. City of Colo. Springs, 638 P.2d
752 (Colo. 1981).</T>
   <P></P>
   <T>
    <B>Forum for suing out-of-state issuing bank limited.</B>
It is unfair to burden an out-of-state issuing bank with having to defend
litigation over a letter of credit in any state in which the bank could
reasonably expect the credit to be used. Leney v. Plum Grove Bank, 670
F.2d 878 (10th Cir. 1982).</T>

(a)<M>The liability
of an issuer, nominated person, or adviser for action or omission is
governed by the law of the jurisdiction chosen by an agreement in
the form of a record signed or otherwise authenticated by the
affected parties in the manner provided in section 4-5-104 or by
a provision in the person's letter of credit, confirmation, or
other undertaking. The jurisdiction whose law is chosen need not

one address is indicated, the person is considered to be located
at the address from which the person's undertaking was issued.
For the purpose of jurisdiction, choice of law, and recognition

of this section, (ii) the relevant undertaking incorporates
rules of custom or practice, and (iii) there is conflict between

of warehouse's liability.</M>

(a)<M>A warehouse is liable for damages for loss of or injury to the goods caused by its
failure to exercise care with regard to the goods that a reasonably careful person would
exercise under similar circumstances. Unless otherwise agreed, the warehouse is not liable
for damages that could not have been avoided by the exercise of that care.</M>
  <P N="(b)"></P>
  <T>(b)<M>Damages may be limited by a term in the warehouse receipt or storage
agreement limiting the amount of liability in case of loss or damage beyond which the
warehouse is not liable. Such a limitation is not effective with respect to the warehouse's
liability for conversion to its own use. On request of the bailor in a record at the time of
signing the storage agreement or within a reasonable time after receipt of the warehouse
receipt, the warehouse's liability may be increased on part or all of the goods covered by the
storage agreement or the warehouse receipt. In this event, increased rates may be charged
based on an increased valuation of the goods.</M>

    <B>Annotator's note.</B> Since § 4-7-204 is similar to § 4-7-204 as it

    <B>Measure of damages.</B> Where household goods, wearing apparel,
and personal effects of a bailor have a market value, then the measure
of damages for negligent harm to personal property bailed with a
warehouseman is the difference between the fair market value of the
goods at the time the injury was discovered and what would have been
the fair market value at that time if the goods had not been damaged.
Keefe v. Bekins Van &amp; Storage Co., 36 Colo. App. 382, 540 P.2d 1132 (1975).</T>
   <P></P>
   <T>Original costs of goods which were damaged while in possession
of a warehouseman may be considered in determining market value, but
only if combined with other factors such as the length of time the
property has been used, its condition just before, and its salvage
value after the damage occurred.

   <P></P>
   <T>Where an item, while in the possession of a warehouseman, is
merely damaged and is repairable at reasonable expense, the cost of
repairs may be used as the measure of damages.

   <P></P>
   <T>Where articles which have been damaged while in the possession
of a warehouseman have no market value in the ordinary sense, they may
be given a reasonable value on the basis of their value to the owner,
and for this purpose, original cost and the practicability and expense
of replacement can be considered.

    <B>Bound only to common care.</B> It is well
settled that warehousemen are not like common carriers, insurers of goods
committed to their care and liable for all losses not occasioned by the act
of God or a public enemy, but are ordinary bailees for hire, bound only to
common care and diligence and liable only for want of such diligence and
care. Benedict Whse. &amp; Transf. Co. v. McKannon Piano Co., 62 Colo. 180,

    <B>Appellate court must accept trier of fact's conclusion.</B> The
issues of negligence and proximate cause are to be resolved by the trier of
the fact, and upon review the appellate court must view the evidence in the
light most favorable to the party in whose favor the trier of the fact
resolved the inferences to be drawn from the evidence. Hipps v. Hennig,

   <P></P>
   <T>
    <B>An appellate court can reach a conclusion of what constitutes reasonable

Colo. 358, 447 P.2d 700 (1968).</T>
   <P></P>
   <T>
    <B>It cannot be said that a warehouseman is required to foresee,
as a matter of law, that the distribution of keys to other tenants or users
of the building could result in a fire</B> being set. Hipps v. Hennig, 167

   <P></P>
   <T>
    <B>It cannot be said that as a matter of law all warehousemen must employ
a night watchman or put in an automatic sprinkler system,</B> and that the
failure to do so subjects the warehouseman to liability for any fire which
occurs on the premises. Hipps v. Hennig, 167 Colo. 358, 447 P.2d 700 (1968).</T>
   <P></P>
   <T>
    <B>To establish a prima facie case the bailor need only show</B> that the
goods were delivered to the bailee in good condition and that the bailee
returned the goods in a damaged condition. Burroughs Corp. v. Rocky Mt.
Prestress, Inc., 431 F.2d 1185 (10th Cir. 1970).
See Bankers Whse. Co. v. Bennett, 148 Colo. 323, 365 P.2d 889 (1961).</T>
   <P></P>
   <T>
    <B>As a presumption of negligence arises.</B> Once goods are delivered in
good condition to a warehouseman who accepts them, but cannot redeliver
them, or can redeliver them only in a damaged condition, a presumption of
negligence on the part of the warehouseman arises. Hipps v. Hennig, 167
Colo. 358, 447 P.2d 700 (1968); Burroughs Corp. v. Rocky
Mt. Prestress, Inc., 431 F.2d 1185 (10th Cir. 1970).</T>
   <P></P>
   <T>Where in February 1973, a warehouseman accepted the bailor's
goods for storage and redelivered them in September, 1973, in a
water-damaged condition, under these circumstances a presumption of
negligence on the part of the warehouseman arose.
Keefe v. Bekins Van &amp; Storage Co., 36 Colo. App. 382, 540 P.2d 1132 (1975).</T>
   <P></P>
   <T>
    <B>The burden of going forward with evidence to rebut that presumption
rests on the warehouseman.</B> Bankers Whse. Co. v. Bennett, 148 Colo. 323,
365 P.2d 889 (1961); Hipps v. Hennig, 167 Colo. 358, 447 P.2d 700 (1968);

382, 540 P.2d 1132 (1975).</T>
   <P></P>
   <T>
    <B>Once the bailor has established these facts, it is incumbent on the
bailee to come forward with evidence to show</B> that the goods were returned
in good condition, or that there exists some acceptable explanation as to
why they were returned in a damaged condition. Burroughs Corp. v. Rocky
Mt. Prestress, Inc., 431 F.2d 1185 (10th Cir. 1970).</T>
   <P></P>
   <T>
    <B>The effect of this rule requiring the bailee to meet the presumption of
negligence is</B> to place the burden upon the one best able to discharge it.
Bankers Whse. Co. v. Bennett, 148 Colo. 323, 365 P.2d 889 (1961).</T>
   <P></P>
   <T>
    <B>An essential part of every bailment contract is the obligation to
deliver over</B> the property at the termination of the bailment. The bailor
must prove the contract, the delivery of the goods to the bailee, and their
return in a damaged condition. When he has done this, the inference is
deducible that the bailee is at fault and must answer, and especially is this
true if the loss could not ordinarily have occurred without negligence.
His failure to return the goods as delivered to him is inconsistent with
what he agreed to do. The property was in his possession, under his care
and oversight, and away from that of the bailor, who in most cases could
not know under what circumstances it was damaged. Bankers Whse. Co. v.
Bennett, 148 Colo. 323, 365 P.2d 889 (1961).</T>
   <P></P>
   <T>
    <B>There is, however, no shift in the burden of proof</B> which still
remains with the bailor. Hipps v. Hennig, 167 Colo. 358, 447 P.2d 700 (1968);
Burroughs Corp. v. Rocky Mt. Prestress, Inc., 431
F.2d 1185 (10th Cir. 1970).</T>
   <P></P>
   <T>
    <B>Where foodstuffs are received by a warehouse in good marketable
condition but are later contaminated while in storage,</B> the question is,
whether the warehouseman, if he had been the owner engaged in the sale,
storage, and distribution of such would permit them to be stored with or
come in contact with anything which would impregnate them with an odor,
inasmuch as one engaged in such a business as storage of foodstuffs would
presumably know of their susceptibility to absorb or acquire the taste and
odor of other substances and take measures to guard against resulting
contamination. Bankers Whse. Co. v. Bennett, 148 Colo. 323, 365 P.2d 889

  </CATCH-LINE>
(a)<M>A warehouse has a lien against the bailor on the goods covered by a
warehouse receipt or storage agreement or on the proceeds thereof in its possession for
charges for storage or transportation, including demurrage and terminal charges, insurance,
labor, or other charges, present or future, in relation to the goods, and for expenses necessary
for preservation of the goods or reasonably incurred in their sale pursuant to law. If the
person on whose account the goods are held is liable for similar charges or expenses in
relation to other goods whenever deposited and it is stated in the warehouse receipt or
storage agreement that a lien is claimed for charges and expenses in relation to other goods,
the warehouse also has a lien against the goods covered by the warehouse receipt or storage
agreement or on the proceeds thereof in its possession for those charges and expenses,
whether or not the other goods have been delivered by the warehouse. However, as against
a person to which a negotiable warehouse receipt is duly negotiated, a warehouse's lien is
limited to charges in an amount or at a rate specified in the warehouse receipt or, if no
charges are so specified, to a reasonable charge for storage of the specific goods covered by
the receipt subsequent to the date of the receipt.</M>

(a)<M>Except as otherwise provided in subsection (b) of this section, a warehouse's lien

amount due, the nature of the proposed sale, and the time and place of any public sale. The
fact that a better price could have been obtained by a sale at a different time or in a method
different from that selected by the warehouse is not of itself sufficient to establish that the
sale was not made in a commercially reasonable manner. The warehouse sells in a
commercially reasonable manner if the warehouse sells the goods in the usual manner in any
recognized market therefore, sells at the price current in that market at the time of the sale,
or otherwise sells in conformity with commercially reasonable practices among dealers in
the type of goods sold. A sale of more goods than apparently necessary to be offered to
ensure satisfaction of the obligation is not commercially reasonable, except in cases covered

  </CATCH-LINE>
(a)<M>A consignee of a nonnegotiable bill of lading which has given value in good faith,
or a holder to which a negotiable bill has been duly negotiated, relying upon the description
of the goods in the bill or upon the date shown in the bill, may recover from the issuer
damages caused by the misdating of the bill or the nonreceipt or misdescription of the goods,
except to the extent that the bill indicates that the issuer does not know whether any part or
all of the goods in fact were received or conform to the description, such as in a case in
which the description is in terms of marks or labels or kind, quantity, or condition or the
receipt or description is qualified by "contents or condition of contents of packages
unknown", "said to contain", "shipper's weight, load, and count", or words of similar import,
if that indication is true.</M>
  <P N="(b)"></P>
  <T>(b)<M>If goods are loaded by the issuer of a bill of lading:</M>
  </T>

packages of goods if shipped in packages and ascertain the kind and quantity if shipped in
bulk; and</M>
  </T>
  <P N="(b)(2)"></P>
  <T>(2)<M>Words such as "shipper's weight, load, and count" or words of similar import
indicating that the description was made by the shipper are ineffective except as to goods
concealed in packages.</M>
  </T>
  <P N="(c)"></P>
  <T>(c)<M>If bulk goods are loaded by a shipper that makes available to the issuer of a bill
of lading adequate facilities for weighing those goods, the issuer shall ascertain the kind and
quantity within a reasonable time after receiving the shipper's request in a record to do so.
In that case, "shipper's weight" or words of similar import are ineffective.</M>
  </T>
  <P N="(d)"></P>
  <T>(d)<M>The issuer of a bill of lading, by including in the bill the words "shipper's
weight, load, and count" or words of similar import, may indicate that the goods were loaded
by the shipper, and, if that statement is true, the issuer is not liable for damages caused by
the improper loading. However, omission of such words does not imply liability for
damages caused by improper loading.</M>
  </T>
  <P N="(e)"></P>
  <T>(e)<M>A shipper guarantees to an issuer the accuracy at the time of shipment of the
description, marks, labels, number, kind, quantity, condition, and weight, as furnished by the
shipper, and the shipper shall indemnify the issuer against damage caused by inaccuracies
in those particulars. This right of indemnity does not limit the issuer's responsibility or
liability under the contract of carriage to any person other than the shipper.</M>

overissue of documents for fungible goods, substitutes for lost, stolen, or destroyed
documents, or substitute documents issued pursuant to section 4-7-105. The issuer is liable

    <B>Release of goods to dealer as defense.</B> In action for conversion of
goods stored by plaintiff with named defendant, if the plaintiff either
instructed defendant to receive and store the goods for a dealer or
delivered them under such circumstances as to give defendant reasonable
ground to believe that plaintiff intended that the goods be held for the
dealer, and defendant released said goods to the dealer, in good faith,
without knowledge or information that plaintiff intended to hold the goods
until payment by dealer, such constitutes a defense to plaintiff's action;
but defendant warehouseman, having admitted the receipt of goods from
plaintiff in the usual course of its warehouse business, the burden of
going forward with the evidence is on defendant to justify delivery to one
other than plaintiff. Wheelock Bros. v. Bankers Whse. Co., 115 Colo. 197,

conversion if the claimant posts security with the bailee in an amount at least double the
value of the goods at the time of posting to indemnify any person that is injured by the
delivery and that files a notice of claim within one year after the delivery.</M>

  </CATCH-LINE>
Unless a document of title was originally issued upon delivery of the goods by a person that
did not have power to dispose of them, a lien does not attach by virtue of any judicial
process to goods in the possession of a bailee for which a negotiable document of title is
outstanding unless possession or control of the document is first surrendered to the bailee
or the document's negotiation is enjoined. The bailee may not be compelled to deliver the
goods pursuant to process until possession or control of the document is surrendered to the
bailee or to the court. A purchaser of the document for value without notice of the process
or injunction takes free of the lien imposed by judicial process.</SECTION-TEXT>

If more than one person claims title to or possession of the
goods, the bailee is excused from delivery until the bailee has a reasonable time to ascertain
the validity of the adverse claims or to commence an action for interpleader. The bailee may
assert an interpleader either in defending an action for nondelivery of the goods or by
original action.</SECTION-TEXT>

    <B>Claim to limited tax bond rose to the level of a "property interest" sufficient to
constitute an adverse claim.</B> Meadow Homes Dev. Corp. v. Bowens, 211 P.3d 743
(Colo. App. 2009).</T>
   <P></P>
   <T>Absent unusual circumstances, a simple breach of contract does not itself establish a
property interest required for an adverse claim to be a security. An adverse claim may,
however, be based on principles of equitable remedies that give rise to property claims.
Meadow Homes Dev. Corp. v. Bowens, 211 P.3d 743 (Colo. App. 2009).</T>
   <P></P>
   <T>Unusual circumstances entitled claimant to equitable remedies where seller of bond
did more than simply breach a contract. Seller acted in a fraudulent manner intended to
hinder and defraud the rights of the claimant. In addition, the bond was not a fungible
investment security but rather was created as part of a land development project and
ownership of the bond pivoted on which party ultimately bought and developed the land.

company is not a security unless it is dealt in or traded on
securities exchanges or in securities markets, its terms expressly

an investment company security. However, an interest in a
partnership or limited liability company is a financial asset if
it is held in a securities account.</M>

recording satisfies the requirements of § 4-8-319. Ellis Canning Co. v.
Bernstein, 348 F. Supp. 1212 (D. Colo. 1972).</T>
   <P></P>
   <T>
    <B>Where the identity of the contractors is established.</B> With respect to
the requirement for signature contained in this section, then, since the clear
purpose of this provision is to require identification of
the contracting party, where the identity of oral contractors is established a
tape recording itself is enough. Ellis Canning Co. v. Bernstein, 348 F. Supp.
1212 (D. Colo. 1972).</T>
   <P></P>
   <T>
    <B>The tape recording of an oral contract would be a "reduction to
tangible form",</B> under the U.C.C. provisions found in section 4-1-201,
defining "written" and
"writing". Ellis Canning Co. v. Bernstein, 348 F. Supp. 1212 (D. Colo.
1972).</T>
   <P></P>
   <T>
    <B>Where a party admits in his testimony the accuracy of a tape recorded oral
contract,</B> then accordingly, he has admitted "in his pleading, testimony,
or otherwise in court that a contract was made
for sale of a stated quantity of described securities at a defined or stated
price". Ellis Canning Co. v. Bernstein, 348 F. Supp. 1212 (D. Colo. 1972).</T>
   <P></P>
   <T>
    <B>As to the applicability of the statute of frauds, the retention and
enjoyment of the benefits of a bargain</B> validate the alleged unauthorized part
of the transaction. Ellis Canning Co. v. Bernstein, 348

    <B>Sufficient part performance is found to take oral agreement out of

   <T>
    <B>Detrimental reliance on oral promises may compel performance.</B> The
principle embodied in section 139 of the restatement (second) of contracts
that detrimental action performed in justifiable reliance upon oral promises
may be sufficient to compel full or partial performance of the promise in
spite of the applicability of a statute of frauds defense that was applicable
in a case involving an oral agreement to sell securities. Kiely v. St.

(a)<M>Even against a purchaser for value and
without notice, the terms of a certificated security include terms
stated on the certificate and terms made part of the security by
reference on the certificate to another instrument, indenture, or
document or to a constitution, statute, ordinance, rule,
regulation, order, or the like, to the extent the terms referred
to do not conflict with terms stated on the certificate. A
reference under this subsection (a) does not of itself charge a
purchaser for value with notice of a defect going to the validity
of the security, even if the certificate expressly states that a
person accepting it admits notice. The terms of an uncertificated
security include those stated in any instrument, indenture, or
document or in a constitution, statute, ordinance, rule,
regulation, order, or the like, pursuant to which the security is
issued.</M>

governmental subdivision, agency, or instrumentality, even though
issued with a defect going to its validity, is valid in the hands
of a purchaser for value and without notice of the particular
defect unless the defect involves a violation of a constitutional
provision. In that case, the security is valid in the hands of a
purchaser for value and without notice of the defect, other than
one who takes by original issue.</M>
  </T>
  <P N="(b)(2)"></P>
  <T>(2)<M>Paragraph (1) of this subsection (b) applies to an
issuer that is a government or governmental subdivision, agency,
or instrumentality only if there has been substantial compliance
with the legal requirements governing the issue or the issuer has
received a substantial consideration for the issue as a whole or
for the particular security and a stated purpose of the issue is
one for which the issuer has power to borrow money or issue the
security.</M>

  <P N="(c)"></P>
  <T>(c)<M>Except as otherwise provided in section 4-8-205, lack

  <T>(d)<M>All other defenses of the issuer of a security,
including nondelivery and conditional delivery of a certificated
security, are ineffective against a purchaser for value who has
taken the certificated security without notice of the particular
defense.</M>
  </T>
  <P N="(e)"></P>
  <T>(e)<M>This section does not affect the right of a party to
cancel a contract for a security "when, as, and if issued" or
"when distributed" in the event of a material change in the
character of the security that is the subject of the contract or
in the plan or arrangement pursuant to which the security is to
be issued or distributed.</M>

against whom an entitlement holder has a security entitlement with

that the issuer could not assert if the entitlement holder held
the security directly.</M>

   <P></P>
   <T>
    <B>Section does not protect those with actual notice.</B>
The purpose of this section was to make ineffective restrictions on
transfers to persons without notice. The failure to note the restriction
on the certificates is no bar to its enforcement against a person who
had actual notice of it. Irwin v. W. End Dev. Co., 481 F.2d 34 (10th Cir.
1973),

   <P></P>
   <T>
    <B>Those on inquiry notice not denied protection of section.</B>
This section clearly placed the duty on the issuer to note the restriction
conspicuously on the certificate, not on the bank to inquire. And
the statute's protection was extended to all against an unnoted restriction
except those with "actual knowledge of it". Those who are only on inquiry
notice are not denied protection by the code. Edina State Bank v. Mr. Steak,
Inc.,
487 F.2d 640 (10th Cir. 1973), cert. denied, 419 U.S. 883, 95 S. Ct. 150,

   <P></P>
   <T>
    <B>Bank as pledgee was among the persons protected generally by
this section</B> against a restriction not conspicuously noted on the security,
except as to a person with actual knowledge. The wrongful refusal to
transfer gave rise to a right to sue as for conversion by the bank as
transferor.

   <P></P>
   <T>
    <B>Federal securities act does not override section.</B>
The absence of a requirement for a notation of the restriction in the
federal securities act does not override this section under the doctrine
of preemption. This important provision of the code may be read
in harmony with the federal statute. Both regulations can be enforced
without impairing federal superintendence of the field and thus the
state statute need not give way. The securities act shows no intent
to prevent such significant regulation by state law. Edina State Bank v.
Mr. Steak, Inc., 487 F.2d 640 (10th Cir. 1973), cert. denied, 419 U.S.
883, 95 S. Ct. 150, 42 L. Ed. 2d 123 (1974).</T>
   <P></P>
   <T>
    <B>Bank's right to damages not defeated by federal statute.</B>
The prohibition of the federal statute against carrying out transfers
of unregistered stock did not defeat the bank's right to damages under this
section. The court did not have to decide whether the bank as a bona fide
pledgee could enforce specifically the transfer of the collateral to
the purchaser. The only question was whether the bank was entitled to damages
when the issuer asserted its own restriction which was not conspicuously noted
on its stock certificate as a ground for refusing to register a transfer.
In these circumstances the bank was entitled to damages for its loss and the
recovery of them was not violative of the federal prohibition against transfer.

   <P></P>
   <T>
    <B>Under this section an issuer has a duty to register</B> the transfer of securities
as
requested if certain preconditions are clearly met. Dempsey-Tegeler &amp; Co. v. Otis

Corp., 293 F. Supp. 1383 (D. Colo. 1968).</T>

   <T>
    <B>The transfer of cancelled certificates is not rightful.</B> Where
evidence establishes that stock certificates are no longer valid, having
been cancelled on the books of the company, and no evidence is offered
to contradict the correctness of the company records or to establish that
the certificates are in fact valid, there is not a rightful transfer, since
transfer of cancelled, invalidated, certificates does not
constitute a rightful transfer. Folsom v. Sec. Nat'l Bank, 32 Colo.
App. 91, 507 P.2d 1114 (1973).</T>
   <P></P>
   <T>
    <B>The court could not conclude, as a matter of law, that a transfer agent
was immune from liability absent a legal opinion</B> that the proposed transfer
was permissible. Am. Sec. Transfer, Inc. v. Pantheon Indus., Inc., 871
F. Supp. 400 (D. Colo. 1994).</T>
   <P></P>
   <T>
    <B>Request to reissue a stock certificate without the restrictive legend is
considered a "request to transfer shares" within the meaning of this
section.</B> Therefore it falls within the duties of § 4-8-406. Am. Sec.
Transfer, Inc. v. Pantheon Indus., Inc., 871 F. Supp. 400 (D. Colo. 1994).</T>
   <P></P>

removal of restrictive legends. Clancy Sys. Int'l, Inc. v. Salazar, 177 P.3d 1235 (Colo.
2008).</T>
   <P></P>

    <B>A party requesting reissuance of a stock certificate cannot claim status
as a purchaser for value.</B> Am. Sec. Transfer, Inc. v. Pantheon Indus.,

Colorado substituted the phrase "Oil, gas, minerals, or other substances of value that

and
added the phrase "except as used in section 4-9-609 (b)," in subsection (a)(64). Colorado
reserved three definitional subsections, (a)(65) through (a)(67); all subsequent definitions

    <B>Annotator's note.</B>
Since § 4-9-102 is similar to §§ 4-9-105, 4-9-106, 4-9-301, and 4-9-306
as
they existed prior to the 2001 repeal and reenactment of this article, relevant cases
construing
those provisions have been included in the annotations to this section.</T>
   <P></P>
   <T>
    <B>A debtor who makes representations in a security agreement regarding the
intended use of collateral should be bound by those representations.</B> That is
especially true where the debtors fail to inform the creditor that they intend to use the
collateral for other than personal, family, or household purposes. The classification of
the collateral, for purposes of perfection of the security interest, is determined when the
security interest attaches. The later use of the collateral for another purpose than as
stated in the security agreement is irrelevant in determining whether the security interest
is perfected. Nelson v. John Deere Credit, 340 B.R. 86 (Bankr. D. Colo. 2006).</T>
   <P></P>
   <T>
    <B>Bank has security interest in proceeds generating "account".</B>
A bank has no security interest in the proceeds of either chickens or eggs, except to the
extent such proceeds generated a prepetition "account" as defined in this section. K.L.
Smith
Enters., Ltd. v. United Bank, 2 B.R. 280 (Bankr. D. Colo. 1980).</T>
   <P></P>
   <T>
    <B>"General intangible" does not include "a thing in action" to recover from an
"account".</B> Millennium Bank v. UPS Capital Bus. Credit, 2014 COA 30, 327 P.3d
335.</T>
   <P></P>
   <T>
    <B>Whether recovery from a lawsuit is categorized as proceeds of an "account" or a
"general intangible"</B> depends on the nature of the claim for which the damages are
awarded. Arbitration award for a breach of an express warranty related to excess costs in
labor and materials is a "general intangible", and the award is not attributable to an
unrelated contractual relationship the debtor had with another party. Millennium Bank v.
UPS Capital Bus. Credit, 2014 COA 30, 327 P.3d 335.</T>
   <P></P>
   <T>
    <B>The right to collect annual campground membership dues is a right to payment
for
services rendered,</B>
which is an ordinary commercial account receivable. If the security interest is in
accounts,
the law of the jurisdiction in which the debtor is located governs the perfection and the
effect
of perfection or nonperfection of the security interest. Therefore, since the debtor was
located at its place of business in Florida, Florida was the proper jurisdiction in which to
file
in order to perfect a security interest in the collateral, making the location of the collateral
in Colorado irrelevant. Capitran Inc. v. Great W. Bank, 872 P.2d 1370 (Colo. App.
1994).</T>
   <P></P>
   <T>
    <B>"Debtor" construed.</B>
Accommodation comakers and those others who will be called upon to pay deficiencies
are
"debtors" within the meaning of subsection (1)(d) and § 4-9-504 (3), and are
entitled
to notice of the disposition of the collateral. First Nat'l Bank v. Cillessen, 622 P.2d 598
(Colo. App. 1980).</T>
   <P></P>
   <T>"Debtor" includes both the owner of the collateral and the obligor when they are not
the
same person. First Nat'l Bank v. Cillessen, 622 P.2d 598 (Colo. App. 1980).</T>
   <P></P>
   <T>
    <B>Subsection (1)(d) does not require "debtor" to be owner</B> or have rights in
the
collateral. First Nat'l Bank v. Cillessen, 622 P.2d 598 (Colo. App. 1980).</T>
   <P></P>
   <T>
    <B>"Debtor" includes a guarantor</B>
and as a debtor the guarantor may not waive debtor's right to insist on a commercially
reasonable disposition of collateral. May v. Women's Bank, N.A., 807 P.2d 1145 (Colo.
1991).</T>

People ex rel. VanMeveren v. District Court, 619 P.2d 494 (Colo. 1980).</T>

   <T>
    <B>An unperfected security interest becomes subordinate to the rights acquired by a
lien
creditor</B> when a writ of garnishment is served on the garnishee at a time when the
garnishor has no notice of the security interest. Welbourne Dev. Co. v. Affiliated
Clearance
Corp., 28 Colo. App. 313, 472 P.2d 684 (1970).</T>
   <P></P>
   <T>
    <B>For the inconsistency between § 4-9-203 and this section on subject of
proceeds,</B> see Fort Collins Prod. Credit Ass'n v. Carroll Dairy, 37 Colo. App. 536,
553
P.2d 95 (1976) (decided prior to the 1977 amendment of this section and §
4-9-203).</T>
   <P></P>
   <T>
    <B>Nothing in the language of subsection (1) requires that the disposition of
collateral
must be final in order to generate proceeds.</B> In re Clancy &amp; Co. Const., Inc.,
214
B.R. 387 (Bankr. D. Colo. 1997).</T>
   <P></P>
   <T>
    <B>Effect of failure to use word "proceeds" in security agreement.</B>
Even absent use of the specific word "proceeds" in a security agreement, the lender
continues, under the uniform commercial code, to have a secured interest in money
received
from the sale of personalty covered specifically in the agreement. Fort Collins Prod.
Credit
Ass'n v. Carroll Dairy, 37 Colo. App. 536, 553 P.2d 95 (1976).</T>
   <P></P>
   <T>
    <B>Cattle which eat feed in which there is a security interest do not constitute
proceeds</B> of the collateral by application of this section. First Nat'l Bank v. Bostron,
39
Colo. App. 107, 564 P.2d 964 (1977).</T>
   <P></P>
   <T>There could be no traceable "proceeds" to which a security interest in cattle feed may
be said to have attached when the cattle have consumed the feed, and therefore such a
security interest could not survive consumption of the feed by the cattle. First Nat'l Bank
v.
Bostron, 37 Colo. App. 107, 564 P.2d 964 (1977).</T>
   <P></P>
   <T>
    <B>Wool incentive payments are "proceeds" of the wool.</B> In re Mahleres, 53
B.R.
86 (Bankr. D. Colo. 1985).</T>
   <P></P>
   <T>
    <B>Satisfaction of judgment constituted only "identifiable proceeds in the hands of
the
debtor",</B> when the debtor paid to judgment creditor the cash proceeds of sale of
equipment in which bank held security interest, and thus bank in enforcing its security
interest in identifiable proceeds of sale was not entitled to recover from judgment
creditor
the amount paid by debtor. First Interstate Bank v. Ariz. Agrochemical, 731 P.2d 746

   <T>Refinancing of a purchase money loan does not automatically extinguish the
creditor's

   <T>
    <B>Bankruptcy court applied dual status rule to case involving financing of

the extent of the purchase price of the new vehicle and the incidental transactional
expenses. Financing of negative equity for trade-in vehicle was not entitled to
purchase-money security interest treatment. Thus debtors had to treat proportion of debt
attributable to purchase price of new vehicle and the incidental expenses as a secured
claim.

    <B>Security interest in automobiles do not attach until title certificates are delivered

but
before the certificates of title were transferred to a bank as the purchaser's agent, the
purchaser executed a security agreement with the bank, intending to create a security
interest in the automobiles to secure repayment of the bank's financing loan, until the
certificates
of title were properly transferred to the purchaser's agent, no right, title, or interest was
created in the purchaser which would enable it to legally convey or encumber the
automobiles.
Therefore, although the bank and purchaser fully intended that the security interest attach
to the automobiles at the time the loan funds were deposited in the purchaser's account,
the
absence of any legal right, title, or interest by the purchaser in the automobiles prevented
the bank's security interest from attaching prior to the time that the certificates of title
were
delivered. Guy Martin Buick, Inc. v. Colo. Springs Nat'l Bank, 184 Colo. 166, 519

   <P></P>
   <T>
    <B>When security interest may attach to debtor's accounts receivable.</B> A
security
interest cannot attach to the accounts receivable of a debtor, if the debtor does not have a
"right to payment", Weld Colo. Bank v. E &amp; E Constr., Inc., 653 P.2d 758 (Colo.
App.
1982).</T>
   <P></P>
   <T>
    <B>Security interest may attach to accounts receivable of public contractor.</B> A
bank's security interest in the accounts receivable of a public contractor is valid only
insofar
as the contractor has rights to the funds retained by the public body to ensure the
payment
of any claims against the contractor. Where a supplier files a notice of claim with the
public
body, the contractor has no rights to these funds until this claim is settled. Thus, the
security
interest does not attach to these funds. Heinrichsdorff v. Raat, 655 P.2d 860 (Colo. App.
1982).</T>
   <P></P>
   <T>
    <B>Right of reformation due to mutual mistake not displaced by this section in cases
of security agreements.</B> Although this section requires a security agreement to be in
writing, the fact that an agreement must be in writing to satisfy a statute of frauds is not
inconsistent with reformation of that written agreement if, by the reason of mutual
mistake, the true agreement of the parties is not expressed in writing. Medallion
Biomed., LLC v. Rosania, 298 B.R. 442 (Bankr. D. Colo. 2003).</T>
   <P></P>
   <T>
    <B>Interest under § 38-22-127 claim takes priority over prior perfected
security

imposes a trust fund for materialmen and laborers, takes priority over a prior perfected
security interest in all present and future accounts receivable and proceeds of accounts.

   <P></P>
   <T>
    <B>Lessor has no security interest in extracted gravel remaining on leased
premises.</B> The owner of a gravel pit who executes a lease allowing the extraction of
gravel from his pit does not have a security interest in extracted gravel remaining on the
leased premises after the right to extract gravel is terminated. The lessee acquires
possession
of the gravel once it is extracted. Palmer v. Corey (In re Musick Constr., Inc.), 34 B.R.
105 (Bankr. D. Colo. 1983).</T>
   <P></P>
   <T>
    <B>Security agreement which provides that secured collateral includes debtor's
tangible
personal property "now or hereafter acquired"</B> does not cover property subsequently
acquired by a third party who purchased debtor's property in foreclosure. This is true
even
though the third party has a director, officer, and minority shareholder in common with
the
debtor. Vance v. Casebolt, 841 P.2d 394 (Colo. App. 1992).</T>
   <P></P>
   <T>
    <B>Trial court did not err in holding that an unpaid seller in a cash sale did not take
priority over a perfected security interest.</B> UCC applies to determine when the title
to
heifers passed. Here title passed to debtor upon delivery of heifers to debtor. At the time
of delivery creditor's interest in the heifers was sufficient to allow creditor's perfected
security interest in after-acquired property to attach. This interest takes priority over the
interests of the cash seller. Coop. Fin. Ass'n v. B &amp; J Cattle, 937 P.2d 915
(Colo.
App. 1997).</T>
   <P></P>
   <T>
    <B>Trial court did not err that value had been given.</B> Agreements, including
assuming the responsibility to pay long-tem liabilities and entering into a security

   <P></P>
   <T>
    <B>Bank's security interest is attached at instant title certificates delivered.</B> A
bank's security interest in automobiles attached to the automobiles at the same instant that
the titles were delivered to the bank. Guy Martin Buick, Inc. v. Colo. Springs Nat'l Bank,
184 Colo. 166, 519 P.2d 354 (1974).</T>
   <P></P>
   <T>After the purchaser of some automobiles delivered its check to the seller, but before
the certificates of title were transferred to a bank as the purchaser's agent, the purchaser
executed a security agreement with the bank, intending to create a security interest in the
automobiles to secure repayment of the bank's financing loan, until the certificates of title
were properly transferred to the purchaser's agent, no right, title, or interest was created
in
the purchaser which would enable it to legally convey or encumber the automobiles.
Therefore, although the bank and purchaser fully intended that the security interest attach
to
the automobiles at the time the loan funds were deposited in the purchaser's account, the
absence of any legal right, title, or interest by the purchaser in the automobiles prevented
the
bank's security interest from attaching prior to the time that the certificates of title were
delivered. Guy Martin Buick, Inc. v. Colo. Springs Nat'l Bank, 184 Colo. 166, 519 P.2d

    <B>The validity of foreign security interests in personal property is governed by this
section except to the extent that motor vehicle titles are governed</B> by §
42-6-131,
and the usage of the broad term "motor vehicle titles" indicates the legislative intent that
whenever the question as to title to a motor vehicle arises with regard to a foreign
security
interest, the question is to be answered by application of § 42-6-131 and is
precluded
from the application of the provisions of § 4-9-103(3). Doenges-Glass, Inc. v.

    <B>Code as enacted in New York determined validity and perfection of security
interest.</B> Where seller's only office is located in New York, and assignee of seller's
accounts receivable is a New York corporation, the requirements of the uniform
commercial
code as enacted by New York determines the validity and perfection of assignee's
security

Therefore,
since the debtor was located at its place of business in Florida, Florida was the proper
jurisdiction in which to file in order to perfect a security interest in the collateral, making
the
location of the collateral in Colorado irrelevant. Capitran Inc. v. Great Western Bank,

    <B>A financing statement was not rendered invalid by fact that the financing

   <P></P>
   <T>
    <B>The filing need only put other creditors on notice of a possible security
interest</B>
in the collateral in question, and it is sufficient if the facts of a case show that a third
party,
assisted by external evidence, could identify the object as being covered by the
agreement.
Mtn. Credit v. Michiana Lumber &amp; Supply, Inc., 31 Colo. App. 112, 498 P.2d
967
(1972).</T>
   <P></P>
   <T>
    <B>Since the "notice filing" system adopted by the U.C.C. requires that</B> a
secured
party provide in public record enough information to alert interested parties that there
may
be a prior security interest. In re Colo. Mercantile Co., 299 F. Supp. 55 (D. Colo. 1969).</T>
   <P></P>
   <T>
    <B>The use of the term "consumer goods" fails to satisfy this section,</B> as it is
too
broad, general, and meaningless to fulfill the demand of § 4-9-402(1) that the
financing
statement at least reveal "the types". The description of collateral as simply "consumer
goods" is insufficient in that it neither specifies the types nor the items, and where the
collateral is used by the owner it would not seem to be an undue hardship to require the
lender to designate in more meaningful terms. In re Lehner, 303 F. Supp. 317 (D. Colo.
1969), aff'd per curiam and reh'g denied, 427 F.2d 357 (10th Cir. 1970).</T>

    <B>Log-loader sufficiently described.</B> The use of the words "logging
equipment
and machinery used in logging operations" on one financing statement and the words
"new
and used equipment for logging and general construction" on another statement
sufficiently
describes the property so as to create a valid lien on a log-loader. Mtn. Credit v.

   <P></P>
   <T>
    <B>Sufficient description of mobile home.</B>
Use of the words "floor plans" without other descriptive phrases is not sufficiently
specific to describe mobile homes as collateral; however, use of those words in the
context "Floor plans of Modular Homes being constructed by Ft. Lupton Builders,
1500 Factory Circle, Ft. Lupton, Colorado 80621" is sufficient notice of a possible
security interest in a type of collateral, mobile home units being constructed by
Ft. Lupton Builders. Platte Valley Bank v. B &amp; J Constr., Inc., 44 Colo. App. 21,

    <B>Annotator's note.</B> Since § 4-9-610 is similar to § 4-9-504 as it
existed prior to the 2001 repeal and reenactment of this article, relevant cases construing
that
provision have been included in the annotations to this section.</T>
   <P></P>
   <T>
    <B>Issuance of title certificate to repossessor involves no deprivation of due
process</B> as contemplated by the fourteenth amendment or state constitution. It may
be
that repossession of automobiles or any other property sold on time payment with an
express
agreement permitting such repossession without notice may be resulting in great abuses,
and
controls are needed. If so, the regulation of this abuse is a matter for the general
assembly,
not the courts. Sifuentes v. Weed, 186 Colo. 109, 525 P.2d 1157 (1974).</T>
   <P></P>
   <T>
    <B>Authorization of self-help repossessions is not enough to sufficiently involve the
state</B> in the acts of repossessors for their acts to be action "under color of" state law.
Kirksey v. Theilig, 351 F. Supp. 727 (D. Colo. 1972).</T>
   <P></P>
   <T>
    <B>"Disposition" of collateral connotes receipt of "proceeds".</B> Where
collateral
was released to the debtor, and the creditor did not receive "proceeds", no "disposition"
of the collateral took place. Silverberg v. Colantuno, 991 P.2d 280 (Colo. App. 1998).</T>
   <P></P>
   <T>
    <B>Presumption that proceeds from sale without notice equal balance owing.</B>
Where there is no notice prior to sale of collateral, it is rebuttably presumed that the value
of the collateral sold is equal to the balance owing on any notes. To rebut the
presumption,
the secured party has the burden of proving, by other evidence, that the market value of
the
collateral and that, after application of that amount, there was a balance still owing on the
notes. United Bank v. Reed, 635 P.2d 922 (Colo. App. 1981); Gapter v. Kocjancic, 703
P.2d
660 (Colo. App. 1985); Tajalli v. Gharibi, 758 P.2d 190 (Colo. App. 1988).</T>
   <P></P>
   <T>
    <B>The reason for exempting from the notice requirement a transaction where there
is
a recognized market is</B> that the price on the recognized market represents the fair
market
value from day to day, so if there is a recognized market, theoretically, the best price at
any
given time is the current market price. Cmty. Mgt. Ass'n of Colo. Springs, Inc. v.
Tousley, 32 Colo. App. 33, 505 P.2d 1314 (1973).</T>
   <P></P>
   <T>
    <B>Repossessed automobiles are not collateral of a type sold on a recognized
market</B> within the meaning of this section which excuses notification of sale in case
of
such collateral. Cmty. Mgt. Ass'n of Colo. Springs, Inc. v. Tousley, 32 Colo. App.
33, 505 P.2d 1314 (1973).</T>
   <P></P>
   <T>
    <B>Since there is no recognized market for the sale of repossessed
automobiles,</B>
debtors are entitled to notice of sale of the repossessed automobile. Cmty. Mgt.

   <P></P>
   <T>
    <B>Computer hardware is not collateral of a type sold on a recognized market</B>
within the meaning of this section which excuses notification of sale in case of such
collateral. 1st Charter Lease Co. v. McAl, Inc., 679 P.2d 114 (Colo. App. 1984).</T>
   <P></P>
   <T>
    <B>Immediate action against guarantors.</B> Where by its terms a security
document
is an absolute guaranty, the obligation of the guarantors may be immediately enforced,
without the necessity of an action against the principal obligor or collateral. First Com.
Corp.
v. Geter, 37 Colo. App. 391, 547 P.2d 1291 (1976).</T>
   <P></P>
   <T>
    <B>The right of a secured party to a deficiency judgment is established,</B> so that
failure of secured party to give reasonable notice of sale does not result in a forfeiture of
the
right to recover a deficiency judgment. Cmty. Mgt. Ass'n of Colo. Springs, Inc. v.
Tousley, 32 Colo. App. 33, 505 P.2d 1314 (1973).</T>
   <P></P>
   <T>Failure to give notice of the disposition of the collateral does not preclude the
creditor from recovering a deficiency if it can prove the amount thereof. First Nat'l Bank
v.
Cillessen, 622 P.2d 598 (Colo. App. 1980); Zimmerman v. Cook, 651 P.2d 910 (Colo.
App.
1982).</T>
   <P></P>
   <T>
    <B>Director of revenue not involved in repossession and transfer of ownership.</B>
The activity of the director of revenue in the issuance of a new title to a repossessor of a
motor vehicle is strictly limited to the ministerial duty of providing prima facie evidence
of
what has already occurred by purely private action, namely, the transfer of title from the
debtor to the creditor in a manner specifically provided for by their agreement. It does
not
in any meaningful way involve the director in the repossession and subsequent transfer of
ownership to the repossessor. Sifuentes v. Weed, 186 Colo. 109, 525 P.2d 1157 (1974).</T>
   <P></P>
   <T>
    <B>Sufficient evidence that notice sent.</B> The existence of a business custom is
sufficient to warrant a presumption that notice was sent. It is then up to the court to
decide
if that presumption is overcome by other evidence. Greeley Nat. Bank v. Sloan, 677 P.2d
409 (Colo. App. 1983).</T>
   <P></P>
   <T>
    <B>Amount received at sale as evidence of market value of collateral.</B> If the
sale
of the collateral has been conducted in accordance with the requirements of the UCC, the
amount received at the sale will be competent evidence of the market value. First Nat'l
Bank
v. Cillessen, 622 P.2d 598 (Colo. App. 1980).</T>
   <P></P>
   <T>
    <B>Amount received at sale is not evidence of market value if sale is not conducted
in
compliance with law.</B> Where, because of lack of notice, the sale is not conducted in
compliance with the law, the amount received is not evidence of the market value, and
the
secured party has to prove value by other evidence. First Nat'l Bank v. Cillessen, 622
P.2d
598 (Colo. App. 1980).</T>
   <P></P>
   <T>
    <B>Debtor entitled to market value offset against balance due.</B> The debtors are
entitled to have the market value of the collateral at the time and place of sale offset
against
any balance due on the indebtedness. First Nat'l Bank v. Cillessen, 622 P.2d 598 (Colo.
App. 1980).</T>
   <P></P>
   <T>
    <B>Evidence of purchaser's lack of good faith.</B> Knowledge that the holder of a
subordinate security interest had not been given the notice required by this section might
be
evidence of a want of good faith on the part of a purchaser. Young v. Golden State
Bank,
39 Colo. App. 45, 560 P.2d 855 (1977).</T>
   <P></P>
   <T>
    <B>"Debtor" construed.</B> Accommodation comakers and those others who will
be
called upon to pay deficiencies are "debtors" within the meaning of § 4-9-105 (1)(d)
and subsection (3) of this section, and are entitled to notice of the disposition of the
collateral. First Nat'l Bank v. Cillessen, 622 P.2d 598 (Colo. App. 1980).</T>
   <P></P>
   <T>Subsection (3) deals with both the collateral and the obligation and, accordingly, the
term "debtor" includes both the owner of the collateral and the obligor when they are not
the
same person. First Nat'l Bank v. Cillessen, 622 P.2d 598 (Colo. App. 1980).</T>
   <P></P>
   <T>
    <B>"Debtor" includes a guarantor</B> and, as a debtor, the guarantor may not
waive
debtor's right to insist on a commercially reasonable disposition of collateral. May v.
Women's Bank, N.A., 807 P.2d 1145 (Colo. 1991).</T>
   <P></P>
   <T>
    <B>A guarantor is treated as a debtor for purposes of article 9 of the Colorado
Uniform
Commercial Code.</B> The protections afforded by subsection (3) that collateral be
disposed of in a commercially reasonable manner are also provided to a guarantor. FBS

   <P></P>
   <T>
    <B>In proving "commercial reasonableness",</B> the burden of proof is on the
creditor.

   <P></P>
   <T>
    <B>Creditor's sale of property used as collateral to themselves is not commercially
reasonable</B> when there is expert testimony that there was no recognized market for
the
property and it was not subject to widely distributed standard price quotation. Cooper
Investments v. Conger, 775 P.2d 76 (Colo. App. 1989).</T>
   <P></P>
   <T>
    <B>The retention of collateral by a creditor for an excessive period of time without
disposition</B> may be commercially unreasonable in violation of this section. The
question of reasonableness is one of fact for the trial court. Tajalli v. Gharibi, 758 P.2d
190
(Colo. App. 1988).</T>
   <P></P>
   <T>
    <B>Presumption of no deficiency following repossession.</B> There is a
presumption
that the value of the repossessed collateral is equal to the amount of the outstanding debt
and
that, therefore, there is no deficiency. First Nat'l Bank v. Cillessen, 622 P.2d 598 (Colo.
App. 1980).</T>
   <P></P>
   <T>
    <B>This section provides that reasonable notification of sale must be made
unless</B>
the collateral is either perishable, threatens to decline speedily in value, or is of a type
customarily sold on a recognized market. Cmty. Mgt. Ass'n of Colo. Springs, Inc.
v. Tousley, 32 Colo. App. 33, 505 P.2d 1314 (1973).</T>

183, 508 P.2d 1264 (1973).</T>
   <P></P>
   <T>
    <B>The purpose of the notice requirement in subsection (3)</B> is to give all
persons
having interests in the collateral or facing possible deficiency claims an opportunity to
protect their interests and to utilize all practicable means of reducing to eliminating their
potential liability. W. Nat'l Bank v. VFW Post 8103, 660 P.2d 919 (Colo. App.
1983).</T>
   <P></P>
   <T>
    <B>A post-default waiver by the defendant of the notice requirement of subsection
(3)</B> can be made only when the debtor knowingly and specifically agrees to waive
right
to such notice. Burdick v. Tucker, 780 P.2d 34 (Colo. App. 1989).</T>
   <P></P>
   <T>
    <B>If a secured party fails to give proper notice under subsection (3),</B> a
presumption arises that the value of the collateral at the time of sale was equal to the
amount
of the outstanding debt, so that no deficiency results. Colo. Leasing Corp. v. Borquez,
738 P.2d 377 (Colo. 1986).</T>

    <B>Notice required under subsection (3) may not be waived.</B> United Bank v.

   <P></P>
   <T>
    <B>Fulfillment of notice requirement for private sale.</B> In the case of a private
sale,
the statutory notice requirement is fulfilled when the creditor sends reasonable
notification
stating the date after which the collateral will be sold. W. Nat'l Bank v. VFW Post
8103, 660 P.2d 919 (Colo. App. 1983).</T>
   <P></P>

   <P></P>
   <T>
    <B>Failure of creditor to comply with the notice requirements of this section did not

(a)<M>The general assembly recognizes that, in the past, certain debtors may have been
disadvantaged by the actions of repossessors and that such debtors were then unable to
obtain just redress for their losses in the courts, especially in cases in which the creditor
who initiated the action by employing or contracting with the repossessor was shielded
from liability because the repossessor was categorized by the courts as an independent
contractor. The general assembly wishes to ensure that the repossessor is bonded or that
