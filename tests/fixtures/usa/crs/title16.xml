Articles 1 to 13 of this title (excluding articles 2.5, 2.7, 8.5, 11.3, 11.5, 11.7, 11.8, and
11.9) were numbered as articles 1 to 13 of chapter 39, C.R.S. 1963. The provisions of
those articles were repealed and reenacted in 1972, resulting in the addition, relocation,
and elimination of sections as well as subject matter. For amendments to those articles
prior to 1972, consult the Colorado statutory research explanatory note beginning on
page vii in the front of this volume. For a detailed comparison of those articles, see the

(1)<M>The defendant may appeal a judgment of the county court in a criminal action under
simplified procedure to the district court of the county. To appeal, the defendant shall, within
thirty-five days after the date of entry of the judgment or the denial of posttrial motions,
whichever is later, file notice of appeal in the county court, post any advance costs that are
required for the preparation of the record, and serve a copy of the notice of appeal upon the
appellee. The defendant shall also, within such thirty-five days, docket the appeal in the
district court and pay the docket fee. No motion for new trial or in arrest of judgment shall
be required as a prerequisite to an appeal, but such motions may be made pursuant to
applicable rule of the Colorado supreme court.</M>
  <P N="(2)"></P>
  <T>(2)<M>The notice of appeal shall state with particularity the alleged errors of the county
court or other grounds relied upon for the appeal and shall include a stipulation or
designation of the evidence and other proceedings which the appellant desires to have
included in the record certified to the district court. If the appellant intends to urge upon
appeal that the judgment or a finding or conclusion is unsupported by the evidence or is
contrary to the evidence, the appellant shall include in the record a transcript of all evidence
relevant to that finding or conclusion. The appellee shall have fourteen days after service
upon him or her of the notice of appeal to file with the clerk of the county court and serve
upon the appellant a designation of any additional parts of the transcript or record which he
or she deems necessary. The advance cost of preparing the additional record shall be posted
by the appellant with the clerk of the county court within seven days after service upon him
or her of the appellee's designation, or the appeal will be dismissed. If the district court finds
that any part of the additional record designated by the appellee was unessential to a
complete understanding of the questions raised by the appeal, it shall order the appellee to
reimburse the appellant for the cost advanced for the preparation of that part without regard
to the outcome of the appeal.</M>
  </T>
  <P N="(3)"></P>
  <T>(3)<M>Upon the filing of a notice of appeal and upon the posting of any advance costs
by the appellant, as are required for the preparation of a record, unless the appellant is
granted leave to proceed as an indigent, the clerk of the county court shall prepare and issue
as soon as possible a record of the proceedings in the county court, including the summons
and complaint or warrant, the separate complaint if any has been issued, and the judgment.
The record shall also include a transcription or a joint stipulation of such part of the actual
evidence and other proceedings as the parties designate. If the proceedings have been
recorded electronically, the transcription of designated evidence and proceedings shall be
prepared in the office of the clerk of the court, either by him or her or under his or her
supervision, within forty-two days after the filing of the notice of appeal or within such
additional time as may be granted by the county court. The clerk shall notify in writing the
opposing parties of the completion of the record, and such parties shall have fourteen days
within which to file objections. If none are received, the record shall be certified forthwith
by the clerk. If objections are made, the parties shall be called for hearing and the objections
settled by the county judge and the record then certified.</M>
  </T>
  <P N="(4)"></P>
  <T>(4)<M>When the record has been duly certified and any additional fees
therefor paid, it shall be filed with the clerk of the district court

  </T>
  <P N="(5)"></P>
  <T>(5)<M>A written brief setting out matters relied upon as constituting error and outlining
any arguments to be made shall be filed in the district court by the appellant within
twenty-one days after certification of the record. A copy of the appellant's brief shall be
served upon the appellee. The appellee may file an answering brief within twenty-one days
after such service. A reply brief may be filed within fourteen days after service of the
answering brief. In the discretion of the district court, the time for filing briefs and answers
may be extended.</M>
  </T>
  <P N="(6)"></P>
  <T>(6)<M>Pending the docketing of the appeal, a stay of execution shall be
granted by the county court upon request. If a sentence of imprisonment has been
imposed, the defendant may be required to post bail, and if a fine
and costs have been imposed, a deposit of the amount thereof or the
posting of a bond for the payment thereof may be required by the county
court. Upon a request for stay of execution made anytime after the docketing
of the appeal, this action
may be taken by the district court. Stays of execution granted by the
county court or district court and, with the written consent of the sureties
if any, bonds posted with such courts shall
remain in effect until after final disposition of the appeal, unless
modified by the district court.</M>

officer may either give the person a penalty assessment notice and release him

containing identification of the alleged offender, specification of the

    <B>Section 16-3-102 permits a police officer to arrest a person who has committed
a
crime in the officer's presence. This section does not limit that authority.</B> An
officer
may arrest when a crime occurs in his or her presence. When that crime is a class two
petty offense, the arresting officer may, pursuant to this section, either take the arrested
suspect before a judge or release the suspect after issuing a penalty assessment. Police
compliance with both statutes is achieved because, even though they conduct a full
custodial arrest and search, police "may" still release the offender without taking him
before a judge. A custodial arrest and a discretionary release are not mutually exclusive
under this section. People v. Triantos, 55 P.3d 131 (Colo. 2002).</T>

  <N></N>(1)<M>Every hearing in a county court for the adjudication of a
civil infraction must be held before a county court magistrate appointed pursuant to part
5 of article 6 of title 13, or before a county judge acting as a magistrate; except that, if the
charge includes a crime and civil infraction in the same summons and complaint, all
charges must be made returnable before a judge or magistrate having jurisdiction over
the crime and the rules of criminal procedure shall apply.</M>
  <P N="(2)"></P>
  <T>(2)<M>When a court of competent jurisdiction determines that a person charged
with a misdemeanor or petty offense is guilty of a lesser-included offense that is a civil
infraction, the court may enter a judgment as to the lesser included offense.</M>
  </T>
  <P N="(3)"></P>
  <T>(3)<M>The burden of proof is on the people, and the magistrate shall enter judgment
in favor of the defendant unless the people prove the liability of the defendant beyond a
reasonable doubt. The district attorney or the district attorney's deputy may, in the district
attorney's discretion, enter civil infraction cases for the purpose of attempting to
negotiate a plea or a stipulation to pretrial diversion or deferred judgment and sentence
but shall not be required to so enter by any person, court, or law. The district attorney
shall not represent the state at hearings conducted by a magistrate or a county judge
acting as a magistrate on civil infraction matters. The magistrate or county judge acting
as a magistrate may call and question any witness and shall act as the fact finder at
hearings on civil infraction matters.</M>

the potential for frustrating various statutory provisions directed at repeat offenders,
former offenders, and habitual offenders, the only exceptions to the time limitation
specified in subsection (5)(a) of this section are cases in which the court hearing the
collateral attack finds:</M>

    <B>Unlawful arrest is not official act.</B> If an arrest is not
a lawful one, if it is made under a void warrant or without a warrant
in a case where a warrant is required, or if it is not made in such
circumstances as justify the arrest without a warrant, the officer
is not acting in his official capacity, either by virtue of, or
under color of, office; and they are merely his private or personal
acts for which his sureties are not liable. Johnson v. Enlow,

    <B>Authority to arrest outside territorial jurisdictions.</B>
All Colorado police officers have the power to make arrests,
even when outside of their territorial jurisdictions, when a
crime has been committed in their presence.
People v. Bloom, 195 Colo. 246, 577 P.2d 288 (1978).</T>
   <P></P>
   <T>
    <B>A peace officer has authority to make arrests without a warrant of
persons</B> committing or attempting to commit offenses in his
presence, whether the offense be a felony or a misdemeanor, of
persons who have committed felonies out of his presence, of
persons he has reasonable cause to believe guilty of a felony
that has been committed, and of persons charged, upon reasonable
cause, with having committed a felony. Johnson v. Enlow, 132
Colo. 101, 286 P.2d 630 (1955).</T>
   <P></P>
   <T>An officer may make an arrest for violation of a misdemeanor
without a warrant if the officer has probable cause or reasonable

   <P></P>
   <T>
    <B>Even where probable cause exists.</B> Although police officers have probable
cause to believe a suspect committed a crime, nevertheless they may not
enter a private residence to effect an arrest in the absence of exigent
circumstances. McCall v. People, 623 P.2d 397 (Colo. 1981).</T>
   <P></P>
   <T>
    <B>Exigent circumstances encompasses compelling need for immediate police
action.</B> The doctrine of exigent circumstances encompasses those situations
where, due to an emergency, the compelling need for immediate police action
militates against the strict adherence to the warrant requirement. McCall
v. People, 623 P.2d 397 (Colo. 1981).</T>
   <P></P>
   <T>
    <B>People's burden to rebut presumption of unconstitutional arrest without
warrant.</B> An arrest without a warrant is presumed to have been unconstitutional,
and the state has the burden of rebutting that presumption by showing both
that the arrest was supported by probable cause and that it fell within
a recognized exception to the warrant requirement. People v. Burns, 200 Colo.

    <B>Voluntary consent by occupant may constitute valid waiver of warrant

entry by the police for the purpose of effecting an arrest inside the home
may constitute, under appropriate circumstances, a valid waiver of the warrant
requirement. McCall v. People, 623 P.2d 397 (Colo. 1981).</T>
   <P></P>
   <T>
    <B>Entry into home by preconceived deception lacks consent.</B> Where entry

<AN-SUB>B.<M>Commission of Crime.</M>
    </AN-SUB>
    <ANNO-TEXT>
     <T>
      <B>This section permits a police officer to arrest a person who has committed a
crime
in the officer's presence. Section 16-2-201 does not limit that authority.</B> An officer
may arrest when a crime occurs in his or her presence. When that crime is a class two
petty offense, the arresting officer may, pursuant to § 16-2-201, either take the
arrested suspect before a judge or release the suspect after issuing a penalty assessment.
Police compliance with both statutes is achieved because, even though they conduct a
full
custodial arrest and search, police "may" still release the offender without taking him
before a judge. A custodial arrest and a discretionary release are not mutually exclusive
under § 16-2-201. People v. Triantos, 55 P.3d 131 (Colo. 2002).</T>
     <P></P>
     <T>
      <B>Arrest not limited to where crime has in fact been committed.</B>
The theory that under this section a lawful arrest without a warrant
cannot be made unless a crime has in fact been committed and that
the person arrested committed it is without merit. Van Camp v.
Gray, 440 F.2d 777 (10th Cir. 1971).</T>
     <P></P>
     <T>
      <B>However, a court must determine whether</B> the facts available
to a reasonably cautious officer at the moment of arrest would
warrant his belief that an offense has been or is being committed.
People v. Navran, 174 Colo. 222, 483 P.2d 228 (1971).</T>
     <P></P>
     <T>
      <B>Warrant is unnecessary where breach of peace witnessed.</B>
Schindelar v. Michaud, 411 F.2d 80 (10th Cir.), cert. denied,
396 U.S. 956, 90 S. Ct. 426, 24 L. Ed. 2d 420 (1969).
<AN-SUB>C.<M>Probable Cause.</M>
      </AN-SUB>
      <ANNO-TEXT>
       <T>
        <B>This section permits warrantless arrests</B> by an officer
when a criminal offense had in fact been committed and the
officer had reasonable grounds for believing the person to
be arrested had committed the offense. People v. Nanes,
174 Colo. 294, 483 P.2d 958 (1971); People v. Pickett, 194 Colo. 178, 571 P.2d 1078

People v. Saars, 196 Colo. 294, 584 P.2d 622 (1978).</T>
       <P></P>
       <T>
        <B>And such is "constitutional".</B> This section, which
authorizes an officer to make an arrest without a warrant when a
criminal offense has in fact been committed and he has reasonable
grounds for believing that the person to be arrested has committed
it, is consonant with the case law of the United States supreme court
and the supreme court of Colorado. People v. Nelson, 172 Colo.
456, 474 P.2d 158 (1970).</T>
       <P></P>
       <T>
        <B>The terms "probable cause" and "reasonable grounds" are
substantially equivalent in meaning.</B> Gonzales v. People,
156 Colo. 252, 398 P.2d 236, cert. denied, 381 U.S. 945, 85 S.
Ct. 1788, 14 L. Ed. 2d 709 (1965); People v. Bueno, 173 Colo.

       <P></P>
       <T>
        <B>And so this section authorizing an arrest without a warrant
is satisfied if</B> the arresting officer has probable cause or
reasonable grounds to believe that a crime has been committed
and that the person arrested committed it. Van Camp v. Gray,
440 F.2d 777 (10th Cir. 1971).</T>
       <P></P>
       <T>For a warrantless arrest, officers must have probable cause to believe
not only that an offense had been committed, but that the
person to be arrested had committed it. People v. Boileau, 36

       <P></P>
       <T>
        <B>And valid arrest by a peace officer must be supported by probable

       <P></P>
       <T>
        <B>Violation of municipal ordinance included.</B> Since the
violation of a municipal ordinance is a criminal offense, then
as a matter of law, where the police have reasonable ground for
believing that defendants have committed such offense,
an attempted arrest is altogether lawful and the police would be
derelict in the performance of their duty if they refuse to act.
Boyer v. Elkins, 154 Colo. 294, 390 P.2d 460, appeal dismissed,

       <P></P>
       <T>
        <B>Flight does not solely justify warrantless arrest.</B>
Where the arresting officer knew that a burglary had been
committed, his dispatcher had told him of the burglars'
purported return, and when he arrived back at the scene
he observed the hasty departure of a man who had been
talking with the son-in-law, flight may legitimately give
rise to suspicion, and evidence of flight may be admissible
at trial to show consciousness of guilt, but defendant's
running was not in and of itself sufficient to justify a
warrantless arrest. People v. Bates, 190 Colo. 291, 546 P.2d
491 (1976).</T>
       <P></P>
       <T>
        <B>Exigent circumstances.</B> A police officer may make a
warrantless arrest where he has probable cause to believe that
the suspect has committed a crime and where the officer is
confronted by exigent circumstances.
People v. Boileau, 36 Colo. App. 157, 538 P.2d 484 (1975).</T>
       <P></P>
       <T>Exigent circumstances obviously exist when suspects are
speeding from the scene of the crime. To require a warrant
would impose an impracticable burden. People v. Cox,

       <T>
        <B>However, facts must be available prior to arrest.</B> The
arrest of a defendant can only be justified by the information
available to the officer immediately prior to the arrest, and
the discovery of contraband on the person of one who is unlawfully
arrested does not validate an arrest. People v. Nelson, 172
Colo. 456, 474 P.2d 158 (1970).</T>

       <T>
        <B>Hence, where the mistaken suspicion of an informant on one
matter triggered a police investigation which discovered other
illegal matters</B> during a search, the officer had no knowledge
of any offense being committed in his presence which would have
justified the arrest and he had had no report of any crime having
been committed in the area by anyone resembling the defendant,
and so, since the courts have a responsibility to guard against
police conduct which is overbearing or harassing in order to
protect the constitutional rights of the individual, the
arrest of the defendant was "unreasonable" when tested by the
need to arrest under the exigencies of the situation against
the invasion of privacy which the arrest entailed, and any
evidence obtained was not admissible. People v. Nelson,

    <B>Permissible purposes for investigatory stops.</B> Investigatory
stops constitute an intermediate response by the police between nondetention

questioning
a suspect, who might otherwise escape, regarding his identity or observed
behavior
in order temporarily to maintain the status quo while seeking to procure
more information regarding possible wrongdoing. People v. Severson,

   <P></P>
   <T>Officer's suspicion that the defendants were connected to the reported

    <B>Construction of § 42-2-113 inconsistent with this section.</B> A
construction of § 42-2-113, which requires that drivers' licenses
be displayed to peace officers upon demand,
which would give to a police officer unlimited discretionary authority to
stop any car at any time for any reason as long as he asked contemporaneously for
display of a driver's license would be inconsistent with this section, which
specifically limits an officer's authority to stop persons for investigation
in the absence of probable cause to arrest. People v. McPherson, 191 Colo.

   <P></P>
   <T>
    <B>Limited searches of a person for weapons during an investigative
detention,</B> when probable cause for arrest is lacking, is permissible,
but there must be: (1) Some reason for the officer to confront
the citizen in the first place; (2) something in the circumstances,
including the citizen's reaction to the confrontation, must give the officer
reason to suspect that the citizen may be armed and, thus,
dangerous to the officer or others; and (3) the search must be limited
to a frisk directed at discovery and appropriation of weapons and not
at evidence in general.
People v. Martineau, 185 Colo. 194, 523 P.2d 126 (1974); People v. Shackelford, 37
Colo.
App.
317, 546 P.2d 964 (1976).</T>
   <P></P>
   <T>In determining the reasonableness of a search in the situation where
the search is not full blown but is rather just a protective search for
weapons, the inquiry is a dual one: (1) Was the officer's action
justified at its inception; and (2) was the search reasonably related in
scope to the circumstances which justified the interference in the first
place. People v. Burley, 185 Colo. 224, 523 P.2d 981 (1974).</T>
   <P></P>
   <T>So long as the officer is entitled to make a forcible stop
and has reason to believe that the suspect is armed and dangerous,
he may conduct a weapons search limited in scope to this protective purpose.
People v. Burley, 185 Colo. 224, 523 P.2d 981 (1974).</T>
   <P></P>
   <T>Protective search for weapons is justified only when circumstances of an
otherwise valid stop provides the officer with a reasonable basis to
suspect person stopped may be armed and dangerous. People v. Ratcliff, 778
P.2d 1371 (Colo. 1989);
People v. Sutherland, 886 P.2d 681 (Colo. 1994).</T>
   <P></P>
   <T>
    <B>Based not on hunches and limited in scope.</B> In order
to uphold the stop and frisk as reasonable, both the initial
confrontation and the subsequent search must have been
prompted by the officers' reliance on particular facts, rather
than on inarticulable hunches, and the scope of the frisk must
be limited to that necessary for the discovery of weapons.
People v. Shackelford, 37 Colo. App. 317, 546 P.2d 964 (1976).</T>
   <P></P>
   <T>
    <B>Sufficient basis for weapons search to be excepted from warrant
requirement.</B>
The reasonable apprehension of danger or injury to the police officers --
judged by objective
standards -- provides a sufficient basis for a search to fall within the search
for weapons exception to the fourth amendment's warrant requirement.
People v. Burley, 185 Colo. 224, 523 P.2d 981 (1974).</T>
   <P></P>
   <T>
    <B>Based on the totality of the circumstances, the trial court properly denied
defendant's
motion to suppress evidence obtained during a vehicle search.</B> Trial court properly
found that police officer had reasonable suspicion that defendant was engaged in drug
trafficking sufficient to justify the investigatory stop. People v. Ramirez, 1 P.3d 233
(Colo. App. 1999).</T>
   <P></P>
   <T>
    <B>Even if seizure of person is unconstitutional, evidence abandoned prior to that
seizure is not the fruit of the seizure and should not be suppressed.</B> People v.
McClain, 149 P.3d 787 (Colo. 2007).</T>
   <P></P>
   <T>
    <B>Even if the totality of police officers' conduct rose to the level of a show of
authority to constitute a seizure,</B> evidence abandoned prior to the seizure cannot be
suppressed. People v. McClain, 149 P.3d 787 (Colo. 2007).</T>
   <P></P>
   <T>
    <B>Reasonable grounds to fear suspect armed.</B> Where the
arresting officers stopped defendant because he matched
description of a suspect who had allegedly committed an
act of violence, these circumstances constituted reasonable
grounds to fear that the suspect might well be armed, and
thus, be potentially dangerous. The officers therefore
acted properly in initiating a pat-down search for weapons.

   <P></P>
   <T>
    <B>The record revealed no circumstances which could legitimate
the stopping of defendant's vehicle</B> as a temporary detention
within the contemplation of this section, where the officers had
never seen or heard of defendant before, did not even know
if drug trafficking actually had taken place in the house
under surveillance, and had no reason to believe the sack defendant
carried contained drugs, and where defendant did not violate
any traffic laws as he drove away. People v. McPherson, 191 Colo.
81, 550 P.2d 311 (1976).</T>

   <T>
    <B>Stopping of defendant held not arrest but proper temporary detention

   <P></P>
   <T>
    <B>Discovery of evidence of crime while searching for weapons.</B>
Where the search was limited to a frisk directed at the discovery and
appropriation of weapons, and not to uncover evidence as such, evidence of a
crime having thus been lawfully uncovered, it is competent and admissible in
evidence as relevant proof of the charges of which
defendant is accused.
People v. Martineau, 185 Colo. 194, 523 P.2d 126 (1974).</T>
   <P></P>
   <T>Where police officer obtained probable cause

   <P></P>
   <T>
    <B>Police officers are entitled to conduct an investigatory stop of a motorist if they
have reasonable suspicion that the motorist has committed a traffic violation.</B>
Because the defendant had committed a traffic violation and that offense alone was
sufficient to justify the police encounter, the trial court did not err in denying the
defendant's motion to suppress. People v. Valencia-Alvarez, 101 P.3d 1112 (Colo. App.
2004).</T>
   <P></P>
   <T>
    <B>Trial court improperly suppressed the evidence police obtained after conducting

   <P></P>
   <T>
    <B>Discovery of evidence of crime while responding to taxicab

narcotics, the defendant's motion to suppress was properly
denied. People v. McNeal, 191 Colo. 490, 553 P.2d 757

    <B>Seizure of heroin under plain-view doctrine held proper.</B>
Where police officer, who had legitimately stopped defendant,

automobile which defendant had just exited, he could seize the heroin
under the "plain-view doctrine".
People v. Montoya, 185 Colo. 299, 524 P.2d 76 (1974).</T>
   <P></P>
   <T>
    <B>Trial court properly suppressed evidence</B> seized during search of

   <P></P>
   <T>
    <B>There was no probable cause to stop defendant's vehicle</B> where the

   <P></P>
   <T>
    <B>Trial court properly denied motion to suppress statements made by the

custody at the time he was detained as part of a proper investigatory stop, but that he was
placed
in custody after the arresting officer had
probable cause for the arrest based on identification of the defendant by the victim and
the finding of an outstanding warrant for the defendant's arrest. People v.

    <B>Purpose of section.</B>
The general assembly, in enacting this section, intended to limit peace
officers to exercising their arrest powers and making their law enforcement
efforts within the territorial limits of their authority and to require
that local peace officers be advised of, and participate in, the
extraterritorial law enforcement activities of other peace officers.
People v. Wolf, 635 P.2d 213 (Colo. 1981);
People v. Florez, 680 P.2d 219 (Colo. 1984).</T>
   <P></P>
   <T>
    <B>This section, by negative inference, limits peace officers' authority
to arrest to the territorial boundaries of their jurisdiction</B>
unless they are in fresh pursuit or are accompanied by officers of the
jurisdiction in which the arrest is made.
People v. Lindsey, 805 P.2d 1134 (Colo. App. 1990).</T>

    <B>Violations of this section are not per se violations of constitutionally
protected rights.</B>

(Colo. 1986); People v. Ray, 109 P.3d 996 (Colo. App. 2004).</T>
   <P></P>
   <T>
    <B>When this section has been violated by a peace officer,</B> evidence obtained
as a result of the violation should be suppressed if the violation also
infringes a constitutional right of the defendant, such as the
right to be free from unreasonable searches and seizures. People v. Vigil, 729
P.2d 360 (Colo. 1986).</T>
   <P></P>
   <T>
    <B>An arrest in violation of the statute does not mandate suppression of
evidence obtained therefrom</B> unless the violation is willful or so
egregious as to violate the defendant's constitutional rights.
People v. Lindsey, 805 P.2d 1134 (Colo. App. 1990);
People v. Loggins, 981 P.2d 630 (Colo. App. 1998).</T>
   <P></P>
   <T>This section held not to require the suppression of evidence where police officer
accompanied injured person to a hospital outside his jurisdiction, emergency room
personnel
discovered cocaine on the injured person, and the cocaine was delivered to the officer.
People v. Loggins, 981 P.2d 630 (Colo. App. 1998).</T>
   <P></P>
   <T>Statutory violation not willful where undercover narcotics detective was directed by
co-defendant to travel to adjacent county, detective did so in good faith, and failure to
have done so could have compromised detective's cover and sting operation. People v.
Ray,
109 P.3d 996 (Colo. App. 2004).</T>
   <P></P>
   <T>
    <B>The departure by an officer from the scene of the crime to
get the assistance of other officers,</B> returning 45 minutes
later, did not constitute such a break in the chain of events that
at the time of the ensuing arrest he would have been required to
have had a warrant, inasmuch as an arrest incidental to fresh pursuit
need not be immediate, recognizing that considerable time may be
needed to procure necessary assistance; the peace officers had
probable cause to arrest, acted without unreasonable delay,
and thus a warrant was not required. Schindelar v. Michaud, 411
F.2d 80 (10th Cir.), cert. denied, 396 U.S. 956, 90 S. Ct.
426, 24 L. Ed. 2d 420 (1969) (decided under repealed
§ 39-14-5, C.R.S. 1963).</T>
   <P></P>
   <T>
    <B>Where the police officer began chasing the defendant in Denver
and remained in fresh pursuit</B> until the automobile was finally stopped in Aurora,
his authority to partake in the arrest and related matters in the form of an
inventory search existed beyond the boundaries of his original jurisdiction
by virtue of this section.

    <B>"Fresh pursuit" defined as in section 16-3-104.</B> Although the definition
in § 16-3-104(1)(c) was promulgated by the general assembly to define
"fresh pursuit" as used in that section, it is persuasive in defining the
same term as used in this section. Charnes v. Arnold, 198 Colo. 362, 600

   <P></P>
   <T>
    <B>Execution of arrest warrant where no fresh pursuit.</B> Where the element
of "fresh pursuit" is not present, it is immaterial who executes an arrest
warrant provided that individuals with lawful authority to make an arrest
are actually present at the scene of the arrest and participate in the arrest
process. People v. Schultz, 200 Colo. 47, 611 P.2d 977 (1980).</T>

    <B>Court interpreted "reasonable grounds"</B> to mean that a police officer in
fresh
pursuit can only make an extra-territorial warrantless arrest if, at the time the party
crosses the boundary, the officer has "probable cause" to believe a crime has been
committed. People v. McKay, 10 P.3d 704 (Colo. App. 2000).</T>

common-law right of a private citizen to aid in an

to make him an agent of the state, for in state action
cases it has been required that the state enforce or

act and the mere fact that the state common law or

a finding of state action under the federal civil

    <B>Unreasonable searches and seizures forbidden.</B>
Section 7 of art. II, Colo. Const., as well as the fourth and
fourteenth amendments to the United States constitution, forbids
unreasonable searches and seizures and further requires that
searches and seizures be made only pursuant to a warrant based upon
probable cause and supported by oath or affirmation. People v.
Thompson, 185 Colo. 208, 523 P.2d 128 (1974).</T>
   <P></P>
   <T>
    <B>Search authorized only upon showing of probable cause.</B>
It is only upon a showing of probable cause that
the legal doors are opened to allow the police to gain
official entry into an individual's domain of privacy
for the purpose of conducting a search or to make an
official seizure under the constitution. People v.
Brethauer, 174 Colo. 29, 482 P.2d 369 (1971).</T>
   <P></P>
   <T>
    <B>Probable cause defined.</B> Probable cause exists where the facts
and circumstances within the officers' knowledge, and of which
they had reasonably trustworthy information, are sufficient in
themselves to warrant a man of reasonable caution in the belief that
an offense has been or is being committed. In dealing with
probable cause, one deals with probabilities. These are not technical;
they are the factual and practical considerations of everyday life
on which reasonable and prudent men, not legal technicians, act.

People v. Thompson, 185 Colo. 208, 523 P.2d 128 (1974).</T>

   <T>Probable cause is an elusive term and is incapable

People v. Thompson, 185 Colo. 208, 523 P.2d 128 (1974).</T>
   <P></P>
   <T>Mere conclusory belief or suspicion by an affiant officer is not
enough upon which to base the issuance of a search warrant. People
v. Clavey, 187 Colo. 305, 530 P.2d 491 (1975).</T>
   <P></P>
   <T>
    <B>Determination of probable cause is a judicial function</B>
to be performed by the issuing magistrate, which in Colorado
may be any judge of the supreme, district, county, superior, or justice
of the peace court under Crim. P. 41, and is not a matter
to be left to the discretion of a law enforcement officer who is employed
to apprehend criminals and to bring before the courts for trial
those who would violate the law. People v. Brethauer, 174 Colo. 29,
482 P.2d 369 (1971).</T>
   <P></P>
   <T>
    <B>The role of the police officer in search warrant practice is
limited</B> solely to providing the judge with facts and trustworthy
information upon which he, as a neutral and detached judicial officer, may
make a proper determination. People v. Brethauer, 174 Colo. 29, 482
P.2d 369 (1971).</T>
   <P></P>
   <T>
    <B>And mere affirmance of belief or suspicion of an officer is
not enough.</B> To hold otherwise would attach controlling significance
to the officer's belief rather than to the magistrate's judicial
determination. People v. Brethauer, 174 Colo. 29, 482 P.2d 369 (1971).</T>
   <P></P>
   <T>
    <B>Independent determination of probable cause.</B>
The fact that the police did not request a warrant to search additional places likely to
contain
incriminating evidence is irrelevant to the independent determination of probable cause
to
search
the
place specified in the warrant.
People v. Chase, 675 P.2d 315 (Colo. 1984).</T>
   <P></P>
   <T>
    <B>A court may sever deficient portions of a search warrant without invalidating the
entire warrant.</B> When a warrant lists several locations to be searched, a court may
suppress evidence recovered at a location for which police lacked probable cause but
admit evidence recovered at locations for which probable cause was established. Under
this severability doctrine, items that are illegally seized during the execution of a valid
search warrant do not affect admissibility of evidence legally obtained while executing
the warrant. People v. Eirish, 165 P.3d 848 (Colo. App. 2007).</T>

  </AN-DIV>
  <ANNO-TEXT>
   <T>
    <B>Affidavit need not be attached to warrant served.</B>
There is nothing which requires that a person given a warrant must receive
a copy of the underlying affidavit or that a copy thereof must be attached
to the copy of the warrant which is served at the
time of the search. People v. Papez, 652 P.2d 619 (Colo. App. 1982).</T>
   <P></P>
   <T>But documents attached to and incorporated in an affidavit
by reference need not be sworn to separately and may thus fall within
the four corners of the affidavit. People v. Campbell, 678 P.2d 1035
(Colo. App. 1983).</T>
   <P></P>
   <T>
    <B>Probable cause must be affirmed in writing.</B> The fourth
amendment to the United States constitution requires probable cause
supported by oath or affirmation as a condition precedent to the valid
issuance of a search warrant. Section 7 of art. II, Colo. Const.,
is even more restrictive and provides that probable
cause must be supported by oath or affirmation reduced to writing.
People v. Brethauer, 174 Colo. 29, 482 P.2d 369 (1971).</T>
   <P></P>
   <T>Under both the fourth amendment of the United States constitution
and § 7 of art. II, Colo. Const., no search warrants may issue without a
showing of probable cause, which, under the Colorado constitution,
must be affirmed in writing before a search warrant may issue.
Flesher v. People, 174 Colo. 355, 484 P.2d 113 (1971).</T>
   <P></P>
   <T>A search warrant may properly issue only upon written affidavit
establishing probable cause for the belief that the items sought are or will be located
on the premises to be searched at the time at which the warrant is procured, or within
a reasonable time thereafter. People v. Erthal, 38 Colo. App. 245, 556 P.2d
1228 (1976), aff'd, 194 Colo. 147, 570 P.2d 534 (1977).</T>
   <P></P>
   <T>
    <B>While an officer's "training and experience" may be considered in determining
probable cause, such training and experience cannot substitute for an evidentiary
nexus,</B> prior to the search, between the place to be searched and any criminal
activity. People v. Eirish, 165 P.3d 848 (Colo. App. 2007).</T>
   <P></P>
   <T>
    <B>Probable cause exists</B> when an affidavit for a search warrant alleges
sufficient facts to warrant a person of reasonable caution to believe that
contraband or evidence of criminal activity is located at the place to be
searched. People v. Delgado, 832 P.2d 971 (Colo. App. 1991).</T>
   <P></P>
   <T>
    <B>During a controlled drug transaction, probable cause exists</B> to search the
location to which the seller went before selling the drugs to the police. People v. Eirish,
165 P.3d 848 (Colo. App. 2007).</T>
   <P></P>
   <T>
    <B>Judge must look within the four corners of the affidavit</B>
to determine whether there are grounds for the issuance of a
search warrant in determining whether the affidavit is sufficient. People
v. Brethauer, 174 Colo. 29, 482 P.2d 369 (1971); People v. Woods,
175 Colo. 34, 485 P.2d 491 (1971); People v. Lindholm, 197 Colo. 270,
591 P.2d 1032 (1979);
People v. Atley, 727 P.2d 376 (Colo. 1986).</T>
   <P></P>
   <T>In determining whether an affidavit is sufficient to
support the issuance of a search warrant, the magistrate must look only
within the four corners of the affidavit, and verbal
communications to the magistrate of additional supporting
information cannot correct an affidavit which is basically
deficient in its statement of the underlying facts and the
circumstances relied upon. People v. Padilla, 182 Colo. 101,
511 P.2d 480 (1973).</T>
   <P></P>
   <T>The court is restricted to the information contained within the four corners of the
affidavit. Thus, it cannot bolster the insufficient affidavit with additional information not
conveyed to the magistrate in the application for the warrant. People v. Miller, 75 P.3d
1108 (Colo. 2003).</T>
   <P></P>
   <T>
    <B>Existence of information outside affidavit is immaterial.</B>
The fact that the police might have had additional information which could have
provided a basis for the issuance of the warrant is of no consequence.

   <P></P>
   <T>
    <B>Verbal communication of facts, as contrasted with written communication, will

   <P></P>
   <T>
    <B>Nor will the affiant's conclusory declaration that he has probable
cause add strength</B> to the showing made. People v. Padilla, 182 Colo. 101,

   <P></P>
   <T>
    <B>Technical requirements and elaborate specificity are not required</B>

   <P></P>
   <T>
    <B>Affidavit interpreted with common sense.</B> In interpreting an affidavit
for a search warrant and the execution of the warrant, a common sense interpretation
must be applied. People v. Del Alamo, 624 P.2d 1304 (Colo. 1981).</T>
   <P></P>
   <T>Task of magistrate is to make practical, common-sense decision as to whether, given
all
circumstances stated in affidavit, there is fair probability that contraband or evidence of a
crime
will be
found in a particular place. People v. Pennebaker, 714 P.2d 904 (Colo. 1986); People v.
Atley,
727 P.2d 376 (Colo. 1986).</T>
   <P></P>
   <T>
    <B>Affidavit must supply underlying fact.</B> Before the
issuing magistrate can properly perform his official function
he must be apprised of the underlying facts and circumstances
which show that there is probable cause to believe that proper grounds
for the issuance of the warrant exist. If a search warrant is to be
sustained, the Colorado supreme court must find that
the affidavit complied with the standards set forth
in Aguilar v. Texas (378 U.S. 108, 84 S. Ct. 1509,
12 L. Ed. 2d 723 (1966)) and in
Spinelli v. United States (393 U.S. 410, 89 S. Ct.
584, 21 L. Ed. 2d 637 (1969)). People v. Brethauer,
174 Colo. 29, 482 P.2d 369 (1971); People v. Lindholm, 197 Colo. 270, 591 P.2d 1032
(1979);
People v. Dailey, 639 P.2d 1068 (Colo. 1982).</T>
   <P></P>
   <T>The United States supreme court, in attempting
to define the area of probable cause with certainty and
to provide guidelines for proper investigation, has
provided a two-prong test. First, the affidavit upon
which the warrant is based must set forth the underlying
circumstances necessary to enable an independent
judicial determination to be made, and, second, the
information upon which the conclusion is based must
come from a reliable or credible source. Flesher v.
People, 174 Colo. 355, 484 P.2d 113 (1971).</T>
   <P></P>
   <T>The affidavit for search warrant must meet the
two-pronged test requiring that the officer establish:
(1) The underlying circumstances from which the
informant concluded that the narcotics were where
he claimed they were, and (2) some of the underlying
circumstances from which the officer concluded that the
informant was credible or his information reliable.
People v. Glaubman, 175 Colo. 41, 485 P.2d 711 (1971).</T>
   <P></P>
   <T>The test for determining probable cause for issuance of a search
warrant based on information provided by an unidentified informant is that
the affidavit in support of the warrant must allege facts from which the
issuing magistrate can independently determine whether there is probable
cause to believe that illegal activity is being carried on in the place
to be searched. People v. Ward, 181 Colo. 246,
508 P.2d 1257 (1973).</T>
   <P></P>
   <T>An affidavit based on information provided in large part by an
unidentified informant must, in order to establish probable cause for issuance
of a search warrant: (1) Allege facts from which the issuing magistrate
could independently determine whether there were reasonable grounds to
believe that illegal activity was being carried on in the
place to be searched; and (2) set forth sufficient facts to allow the
magistrate to determine independently if the informer is credible or the
information reliable. People v. Harris, 182 Colo. 75,
510 P.2d 1374 (1973); People v. Baird, 182 Colo. 284,
512 P.2d 629 (1973); People v. Masson, 185 Colo. 65,
521 P.2d 1246 (1974).</T>
   <P></P>
   <T>In order to support the issuance of a search warrant the issuing magistrate
must be apprised of sufficient underlying facts and circumstances,
reduced to writing, under oath, from which he may reasonably conclude
that probable cause exists for the issuance of the warrant.
People v. Padilla, 182 Colo. 101,
511 P.2d 480 (1973).</T>
   <P></P>
   <T>In testing the sufficiency of affidavits in support of search warrants,
Colorado has followed the mandate of the United States supreme court
in applying the two-pronged Aguilar-Spinelli test. An affidavit which
relies on information supplied by a confidential informant must allege
sufficient underlying facts from which the issuing magistrate can make an
independent determination that illegal activity is being carried on in
the place to be searched. In addition, the affidavit must set forth sufficient information
so that the magistrate can determine independently that the informant is credible
or that his information is reliable. People v. Arnold, 186 Colo. 372,
527 P.2d 806 (1974).</T>
   <P></P>
   <T>The two-pronged test which emphasizes the basis upon which an informer's
tip will provide a foundation for the issuance of a search warrant
requires that the affidavit set forth: (1) The underlying circumstances

    <B>Affidavit contained sufficient underlying facts.</B> Where the affiant
states that the informant personally observed marijuana in the premises to

   <P></P>
   <T>Where it appears that the informant personally saw an illegal narcotic
on the premises, that he was given two marijuana cigarettes by someone on
the premises on September 20, 1972, and that he observed other illegal
narcotics at the time he left the premises on September 20, 1972, these
facts are sufficient to allow a magistrate to determine whether there was
probable cause to determine presence of illegal activity. People v.

   <P></P>
   <T>Requirement that the affidavit for a search warrant set forth

People v. Montoya, 189 Colo. 106, 538 P.2d 1332 (1975).</T>
   <P></P>
   <T>
    <B>An informer need not relate to police officers the specific address</B>
of the place in which he observed the unlawful activity. It is enough if
the informant describes the location and provides the officers sufficient
information so that they can accurately determine such address.

   <P></P>
   <T>
    <B>Details from informant must support independent
court determination.</B> If officer seeking the warrant
is relying upon a tip by another person, then the
information contained in the affidavit upon which the
informant based his conclusion must be of sufficient
detail as to permit the making of an independent
determination by the court of the credibility of
the informant and his information. Flesher v. People,
174 Colo. 355, 484 P.2d 113 (1971).</T>
   <P></P>
   <T>
    <B>Statement that informant is reliable is insufficient.</B>
An affidavit does not establish the credibility of an informant
by merely stating that the informant is known to be reliable.
Nor does an affidavit establish the credibility of an informant
by merely stating that the informant is known to
be reliable based on past information supplied by
the informer which has proved to be accurate. Although
the words "past information" might conjure up in the
mind of the officer some knowledge of the underlying
circumstances from which the officer might conclude
that the informant was reliable, the judge has not
been apprised of such facts, and consequently, he
cannot make a disinterested determination based
upon such facts. People v. Brethauer, 174 Colo. 29,
482 P.2d 369 (1971).</T>
   <P></P>
   <T>As a basis for issuing a search warrant, the mere assertion of reliability
is not sufficient to establish an informant's credibility. There must be a more
comprehensive statement of underlying facts upon which the magistrate can make
an independent determination that the informant is credible or his
information reliable. People v. Aragon, 187 Colo. 206,
529 P.2d 644 (1974).</T>
   <P></P>
   <T>An affidavit for a search warrant seeking to show an informant's
credibility is not satisfactory by merely stating that the
informant is reliable, or that he has supplied information in the
past which proved to be accurate. Nor are irrelevant, albeit correct,
details sufficient.
People v. Montoya, 189 Colo. 106, 538 P.2d 1332 (1975).</T>
   <P></P>
   <T>Where the only recital in the affidavit for a search warrant
bearing upon the informant's credibility or the reliability
of the information supplied was "That the
confidential informant has related information to the
affiant regarding several previous narcotics and dangerous
drugs sellers and users which has been confirmed and
proven reliable by the affiant", this was totally conclusory
and devoid of details sufficient to support an independent
finding of credibility or reliability. People v. Bowen,
189 Colo. 126, 538 P.2d 1336 (1975).</T>
   <P></P>
   <T>An affidavit must contain sufficient facts to allow the magistrate to determine how
the informant obtained the information upon which the affiant relies. Bare assertions of
knowledge are insufficient to establish the informer's knowledge. Statements as to the
informer's reliability must not be conclusory, but must contain information upon which
the magistrate could independently determine the informant's veracity and reliability.
People v. Pacheco, 175 P.3d 91 (Colo. 2006).</T>
   <P></P>
   <T>
    <B>There are at least three ways in which an affidavit might allow a
magistrate to determine the reliability of an informant's information</B> so as to
issue a search warrant: (1) By stating that the informant had previously given
reliable information; (2) by presenting the information in detail which clearly
manifests its reliability; and (3) by presenting facts which corroborate the
informant's information. People v. Masson, 185 Colo. 65,
521 P.2d 1246 (1974).</T>
   <P></P>
   <T>
    <B>The reliability of the informant is established if the information
resulted in arrests.</B>
The issue involved is the reliability of the informant;
this reliability is satisfactorily established if the previous information
led to arrests. People v. Arnold, 186 Colo. 372,
527 P.2d 806 (1974).</T>
   <P></P>
   <T>
    <B>And not in convictions.</B> To impose the more stringent requirement
that the information led to convictions would impose an undue restriction on
law enforcement officers. People v. Arnold, 186 Colo. 372,
527 P.2d 806 (1974).</T>
   <P></P>
   <T>
    <B>Or it is asserted informant previously furnished information
of specified criminal activity.</B> Requirement that the affiant-police
officer support his request for a search warrant with information
showing that the informant was credible, or his information was
reliable, may be satisfied by an assertion that the informant has
previously furnished solid material information of specified
criminal activity.
People v. Montoya, 189 Colo. 106, 538 P.2d 1332 (1975).</T>
   <P></P>
   <T>
    <B>Statement sufficient to establish informant's reliability.</B>
Where search warrant affidavit indicated that previous information supplied
by the informant had led to narcotics arrests and seizures, such
statement was sufficient to establish the reliability of the informant.
People v. Ward, 181 Colo. 246,
508 P.2d 1257 (1973).</T>
   <P></P>
   <T>Where the affidavit related that the informant had, within the past 14
months, supplied information which led to the arrest and conviction of an
individual for possession of a narcotic drug, and that the informant had,
within the past 24 hours, supplied information which resulted in arrests and the
seizure of a quantity of marijuana, this information was sufficient to permit
the issuing magistrate to find that the informant was reliable.
People v. Harris, 182 Colo. 75,
510 P.2d 1374 (1973).</T>
   <P></P>
   <T>Affidavit set forth sufficient facts to permit a determination that
the informant was reliable and the information provided therewith
was sufficient to justify issuance of a search warrant. People v.
Treadway, 182 Colo. 239,
512 P.2d 275 (1973).</T>
   <P></P>
   <T>Where the affidavit alleged that the informant had furnished information
which "has been the cause of approximately 20 narcotic and dangerous drug
arrests in the past year", the magistrate could independently conclude
that the police would not repeatedly accept information from one who has not proven
by experience to be reliable, and hence, the magistrate could determine that the
informant was credible. People v. Baird, 182 Colo. 284,
512 P.2d 629 (1973).</T>
   <P></P>
   <T>The second prong of the Aguilar-Spinelli test is satisfied by the statement in the
affidavit
that the information was received from "a previously reliable confidential informant
whose information has resulted in narcotics arrest and seizures on at least
two past occasions". People v. Arnold, 186
Colo. 372, 527 P.2d 806 (1974).</T>
   <P></P>
   <T>
    <B>Informant's means of obtaining information need not be
recited in the affidavit</B> if there is stated such detail given by
the informant as would corroborate his assertions of criminal
activity. Flesher v. People, 174 Colo. 355, 484 P.2d 113 (1971).</T>
   <P></P>
   <T>
    <B>Citizen-informer rule.</B> Colorado will follow the
citizen-informer rule and will recognize that a citizen
who is identified by name and address and was a witness
to criminal activity cannot be considered on the same
basis as the ordinary informant. People v. Glaubman,
175 Colo. 41, 485 P.2d 711 (1971).</T>
   <P></P>
   <T>
    <B>Affidavit need not contain statement of facts showing reliability of
citizen-informant.</B>
Where the citizen-informant rule applies to information contained in an affidavit for
issuance
of a search warrant, it is not necessary that the affidavit contain a
statement of facts showing the reliability of the citizen-informant,
as is the case when the informant is confidential and unidentified. People

   <P></P>
   <T>
    <B>A police officer's factual statements in an affidavit
that are erroneous and false must be stricken</B> and may not be considered
in determining whether the affidavit will support the issuance of a
search warrant. People v. Malone, 175 Colo. 31, 485 P.2d 499 (1971).</T>
   <P></P>
   <T>
    <B>Deletion of inaccuracies not fatal if sufficient material
facts remain.</B> Where the affidavit still contains material facts
sufficient as a matter of law to support the issuance of a warrant after
deletion of erroneous statements, the supreme court will not strike down
a warrant because the affidavit is not completely accurate.
People v. Malone, 175 Colo. 31, 485 P.2d 499 (1971).</T>
   <P></P>
   <T>The fact that some portions of an affidavit must be stricken because they are
erroneous,
or
that a portion of the evidence relied on for a finding of probable cause is not properly
recorded
and may
not be considered, does not require the issuing magistrate to ignore the
other information supplied by the affidavit. People v. Gable, 647 P.2d 246
(Colo. App. 1982).</T>
   <P></P>
   <T>
    <B>Likewise, affidavit may be amended by sworn testimony before
issuance of warrant.</B> Should the judge to whom application has been made for the
issuance of a search warrant determine that the affidavit is insufficient,
he can require that sworn testimony be offered to supplement the
affidavit or can demand that the affidavit be amended to disclose
additional facts. The testimony
taken would have to be reduced to writing and signed by the witness or
witnesses that offered testimony, under oath, to supplement the affidavit.

   <P></P>
   <T>
    <B>Affidavit not insufficient though based on double hearsay.</B>
Affidavit in support of search warrant was not insufficient although it

Colo. 81, 514 P.2d 1325 (1973).</T>
   <P></P>
   <T>
    <B>Fruits of search supported by defective affidavit are inadmissible.</B>
Where the affidavits were fatally defective, the warrants issued thereon
were nullities, any search conducted under them was unlawful, and the
fruits of such a search are inadmissible in evidence. People v.
Brethauer, 174 Colo. 29, 482 P.2d 369 (1971).</T>
   <P></P>
   <T>
    <B>Affidavit did not recite sufficient facts</B>
which could enable the court to make an independent
determination that there is probable cause to believe
that the defendants were keeping marijuana in their
safe deposit box, where the first six paragraphs of
the affidavit merely provide the information that the
two college students, one of whom reportedly had
engaged at some previous time in selling marijuana,
had rented a safe deposit box, and paragraph seven
states that the treasury department had received information that
one of the defendants kept marijuana in a safe deposit box
in a local bank, since there is no basis to test the credibility
or reliability of the actual source of the incriminating information.
Flesher v. People, 174 Colo. 355, 484 P.2d 113 (1971).</T>
   <P></P>
   <T>The affidavit is not sufficient if no explanation
appears as to how the county sheriff's office obtained

made the observation, or whether the information was
obtained from an eyewitness or from a person who
received the information indirectly. People v. Myers,
175 Colo. 109, 485 P.2d 877 (1971).</T>
   <P></P>
   <T>Statement in affidavit for issuance of search warrant that informant
was present in two apartments located in the same building and observed marijuana
did not have "plain meaning" to indicate that informant had

warrants for both apartments. People v. Ward, 181 Colo. 246,
508 P.2d 1257 (1973).</T>
   <P></P>
   <T>Although the affidavit related that the informant did observe marijuana
and "speed" somewhere in the building at 2018 Ogden Street, there is nothing
in the affidavit to indicate specifically where in that multiple-occupancy
structure the drugs were located. This being so, the affidavit
failed to relate sufficient facts from which the issuing magistrate could
find probable cause to believe that the marijuana and "speed" were
located within the places to be searched, i.e., within each of the defendants'
apartments. People v. Arnold, 181 Colo. 432,
509 P.2d 1248 (1973).</T>

511 P.2d 480 (1973).</T>
   <P></P>
   <T>Because of the long lapse of time, the information in the

    <B>Good faith basis required to challenge warrant affidavits.</B>
As conditions to a veracity hearing testing the truth of averments
contained in a warrant affidavit, a motion to suppress must be
supported by one or more affidavits reflecting a good faith basis
for the challenge and contain a specification of the precise statements
challenged. People v. Dailey, 639 P.2d 1068 (Colo. 1982).</T>
   <P></P>
   <T>
    <B>Affidavit containing stale information.</B> Where the only
information upon which the search warrant issued had been obtained
nearly two months prior to issuance of the warrant and the
staleness of the information in the affidavit was not remedied

People v. Erthal, 194 Colo. 147, 570 P.2d 534 (1977).</T>
   <P></P>
   <T>The warrant was not based on probable cause, and the police could not have

P.3d 1108 (Colo. 2003).</T>
   <P></P>
   <T>Although crimes were perpetrated eight months prior to application for search

   <P></P>
   <T>
    <B>Trial court erred in suppressing evidence because search warrant lacked

    <B>Not every violation of this section requires suppression of evidence

violation of defendant's constitutional rights occurred. People v. Martinez,

   <P></P>
   <T>
    <B>Warrant must describe apartment unit by number or name of tenant.</B>
When authority is desired to search a particular apartment or apartments within
an apartment building, or a particular room or rooms
within a multiple-occupancy structure, the warrant must sufficiently
describe the apartment or subunit to be searched, either by number or other
designation, or by the name of the tenant or occupant. People v. Alarid,
174 Colo. 289, 483 P.2d 1331 (1971).</T>
   <P></P>
   <T>
    <B>And description by street address is insufficient.</B>
When the officers knew or should have known that the house was
not a one-family residence, and the fact that the officers had
notice of the separate dwelling facilities located in the
basement is evident from the affidavit of an officer, the general
rule as to multiple-occupancy structures is applicable,
and a warrant describing the entire house by street address only,
without reference to the particular dwelling unit or units sought to be
searched, is constitutionally insufficient since no facts were
presented which would show that there was probable cause to believe
that criminal activity was occurring in both dwelling places.

   <P></P>
   <T>
    <B>Exception if officers unaware house is multifamily and if search
confined.</B> The general rule of law when dealing with searches
made in rooming houses or apartment houses is subject to an exception,
among others, where the officers did not know, nor had
reason to know, that they were dealing with a multifamily
dwelling when obtaining the warrant, and providing that they
confine the search to the area which was occupied by the person
or persons named in the affidavit. People v. Lucero, 174 Colo.

   <P></P>
   <T>
    <B>Burden of connecting articles not described with crime is upon the state.</B>
When a defendant demonstrates that an article is not
specifically described in the search warrant, and when it is not per se
connected with criminal activity, the burden of showing that
it is so connected falls upon the state. People v. Lujan,
174 Colo. 554, 484 P.2d 1238 (1971).</T>
   <P></P>
   <T>
    <B>Failure to show connection requires their return.</B>
Money seized belonging to the defendant must be returned, when it was
not mentioned in the warrant and was not per se connected with criminal
activity, when the state failed to show a nexus between the money
seized and criminal activity, and when the defendant testified that
the money had been lent to him by family members and friends to
defray the cost of his daughter's funeral. People v. Lujan, 174
Colo. 554, 484 P.2d 1238 (1971).</T>
   <P></P>
   <T>
    <B>Currency was described with reasonable certainty.</B>
Where the search warrant correctly described a $20 bill with
the exception of the last character of the serial number which was
illegible, the likelihood of defendant's possession of another
bill with nine identical characters, all in the same sequential order,
and having a different tenth character from the bill described in
the search warrant was highly improbable, and hence, there was probable
cause to seize the bill as there was reasonable certainty of description.

   <P></P>
   <T>
    <B>Effects intermingled with drugs were validly seized.</B>
Where objection was made to the seizure of the particular personal
effects which serve to identify the person or persons residing at
and in control of the premises searched and the record indicates that
these personal effects were intermingled with the suspected narcotics
and dangerous drugs found on the premises, it was held that these personal
effects, which bore the names of the defendants, were validly
seized since these items might well serve to establish
elements of the crimes for which defendants were charged and for which
the search warrant was issued. People v. Piwtorak, 174 Colo. 525,
484 P.2d 1227 (1971).</T>
   <P></P>
   <T>
    <B>Warrant not insufficient on its face.</B> Command portion of search
warrant which read: "you are therefore commanded to search forthwith the
--------- above described property for the property described" did not render
the warrant insufficient on its face where the property to be searched
had been specifically described "above" two times and where the property to be
seized likewise had been described above as "amphetamines, barbiturates,
opium, opium derivatives, and other synthetic narcotics and implements used
in the traffic and in the use of narcotic drugs".

    <B>Strictness of probable cause requirements.</B> Although the constitutional

523 P.2d 128 (1974).</T>
   <P></P>
   <T>
    <B>Because both probable cause and exigent circumstances must be present in order
to
justify a warrantless search into a defendant's home</B> and trial court found only that
police entered defendant's home in the absence of exigent circumstances without first
making
a probable cause determination, case was remanded to trial court to determine first
whether
defendant informed detective that drugs were in his home, giving detective probable
cause,
and then to determine whether exigent circumstances justified warrantless entry into the
defendant's home. People v. Mendoza-Balderama, 981 P.2d 168 (Colo. 1999).</T>

   <P></P>
   <T>
    <B>Whether or not the consent which is given in a particular case is voluntary
is a question to be determined by the court</B> in light of the totality of the
circumstances surrounding that consent, and the overriding inquiry is whether
the consent is intelligently and freely given. People v. Hancock, 186 Colo. 30,
525 P.2d 435 (1974).</T>
   <P></P>
   <T>
    <B>That defendant's wife was told a warrant would be sought if her consent
to search their home was not obtained</B> does not negate the evidence
which strongly supports the trial court's finding of consent.
People v. Hancock, 186 Colo. 30, 525 P.2d 435 (1974).</T>
   <P></P>
   <T>
    <B>Where trial court evaluated conflicting testimony and evidence relevant to the
issue of consent to search home without a warrant and determined</B> that defendant
did
not consent to a search of his home, absent lack of evidence in the record to support the
trial
court's factual findings, reviewing court is bound to uphold the trial court's conclusion of
lack
of consent and unlawful search. People v. Mendoza-Balderama, 981 P.2d 168 (Colo.
1999).</T>

   <T>
    <B>The link between the place to be searched and the existence of criminal activity
or
contraband is at the heart of fourth amendment protections.</B> Applying the
exclusionary rule to suppress the evidence seized has the salutary effect of requiring the
police to use in the affidavit for the search warrant current information they have
available
or may obtain to establish the link. People v. Miller, 75 P.3d 1108 (Colo.
2003).</T>
   <P></P>
   <T>
    <B>However, even if affidavit is insufficient to establish link</B> between the
place to be searched and the existence of criminal activity, if the affidavit contains
objectively reasonable probable cause, as enumerated by the federal circuit courts, the
good faith exception to exclusionary rule applies. People v. Hagos, 250 P.3d 596 (Colo.
App.
2009).</T>
   <P></P>
   <T>
    <B>Whether an individual conducting a search or seizure is an agent of the
government</B> is determined by the totality of the circumstances. In order to establish
agency, one must show that the government encouraged, initiated, and instigated a search
or seizure or that the person conducting the search acted only to assist law enforcement
efforts. People v. Pilkington, 156 P.3d 477 (Colo. 2007).</T>
   <P></P>
   <T>A private actor's independent motive to investigate creates a strong presumption that
he or she is not an agent of the government, and therefore the fourth amendment does not
apply to the search. People v. Pilkington, 156 P.3d 477 (Colo. 2007).</T>
   <P></P>
   <T>
    <B>Section inapplicable to mistaken judgment of law.</B>
A mistaken judgment of law, such as the mistaken judgment by an officer that the facts
known
to
him are sufficient to warrant a full custodial
arrest of the defendant, is insufficient to cause the
application of this statute. People v. Quintero, 657 P.2d 948 (Colo. 1983), cert. granted,
463
U.S. 1206, 104 S. Ct.

such consent. People v. Brewer, 690 P.2d 860 (Colo. 1984).</T>
   <P></P>
   <T>
    <B>Where no warrant was ever issued</B> and an arrest occurred as a result
of incorrect information in the National Crime Information Computer (NCIC)
after the period of parole had expired, an arrest was illegal,
and any evidence seized as a result of such arrest cannot be covered by the
good faith
exception and must be suppressed. People v. Fields, 785 P.2d 611 (Colo.
1990).</T>
   <P></P>
   <T>
    <B>Violation of fourth amendment rights found</B> when court failed to
review affidavits in support of both wiretap applications and search
warrants to determine if they established probable cause after certain
evidence contained in said affidavits had been struck, the court having
determined that there was no statutory technical violation exception to the
exclusionary rule suppressing such evidence. People v. Vazquez, 768 P.2d

cert. denied, 787 P.2d 174 (Colo. 1990).</T>
   <P></P>
   <T>
    <B>Telephone toll records held admissible under good faith exception to

insufficient because affidavit not so lacking in indicia of probable cause
as
to render official belief unreasonable. People v. Taylor, 804 P.2d 196
(Colo. App. 1990).</T>
   <P></P>
   <T>
    <B>Admission of evidence seized from a defendant's residence pursuant to a
defective warrant</B> did not constitute reversible error, even though
warrant was issued based on an affidavit inadvertently
failing to allege facts linking defendant to the residence to be searched. People v.

   <P></P>
   <T>
    <B>Section does not apply</B>

absence of any cause whatever for its issuance. People v. Mitchell,

   <P></P>
   <T>
    <B>No technical violation where court precedent relied on was based
on different facts.</B>
Technical violation was not found for good faith reliance of prior
court decision where such precedent was based on different factual
situation. People v. Corr, 682 P.2d 20 (Colo.), cert. denied, 469 U.S. 855, 105 S. Ct. 181,
83 L. Ed.
2d 115 (1984).</T>
   <P></P>
   <T>
    <B>Statutory good faith exception to exclusionary rule inapplicable</B> where
mistaken information, even if true, along with other information relied on by
officer, did not constitute reasonable grounds to believe
defendant committed or was
committing a crime. People v. Foster, 788 P.2d 825 (Colo. 1990).</T>
   <P></P>
   <T>
    <B>Statutory good faith exception to exclusionary rule does not exclude evidence
that federal jurisprudence would admit.</B> This section was intended to incorporate
the
federal exception to the exclusionary rule, it does not create a narrower rule. People v.
Saint-Veltri, 935 P.2d 34 (Colo. App. 1996).</T>
   <P></P>
   <T>
    <B>Statutory good faith exception to exclusionary rule
inapplicable</B> to evidence seized after search incident to arrest
where arrest warrant is not supported by probable cause to arrest
the defendant. People v. Woods, 885 P.2d 287 (Colo. App. 1994).</T>
   <P></P>
   <T>
    <B>Good faith exception to exclusionary rule does not apply where a
detective's reliance on a warrant is not objectively reasonable.</B> Where an
affidavit contains no facts that would allow a reasonable officer to conclude
that
probable cause for a search exists, the illegally obtained evidence is not
admissible under the good faith exception to the exclusionary rule. People
v. Leftwich, 869 P.2d 1260 (Colo. 1994); People v. Pacheco, 175 P.3d 91 (Colo. 2006);
People v. Hoffman, 293 P.3d 1 (Colo. App. 2010), rev'd on other grounds, 2012 CO 66,
289
P.3d 24.</T>
   <P></P>
   <T>Information in deputy's affidavit, considered separately and as a whole, failed to
establish a substantial basis for the magistrate's determination that probable cause existed
to issue the warrant. People v. Hoffman, 293 P.3d 1 (Colo. App. 2010), rev'd on other
grounds, 2012 CO 66, 289 P.3d 24.</T>
   <P></P>
   <T>Because the information regarding drug manufacturing at defendant's home was stale
when the police applied for the warrant, no reasonable police officer would have relied
on it. Accordingly, the exclusionary rule operates, not the good faith exception to it.
People v. Miller, 75 P.3d 1108 (Colo. 2003).</T>
   <P></P>
   <T>
    <B>Thus, good faith exception does not apply</B> when the police submit a
defective affidavit to the county judge and continue to rely on that defective affidavit.
Officers involved in obtaining and executing a search warrant have a continuing duty to
exercise reasonable professional judgment. Even though a reviewing magistrate has
executed the warrant, the officer must still read the affidavit and warrant carefully and
must be objectively persuaded that the warrant is sufficient. People v. Randolph, 4 P.3d
477 (Colo. 2000).</T>
   <P></P>
   <T>
    <B>Neither Colorado nor federal law purports to recognize a "good faith"
exception</B> to the exclusionary remedy for statements taken in violation of Miranda.
People v. Mangum, 48 P.3d 568 (Colo. 2002).</T>
   <P></P>
   <T>
    <B>The statute creates a presumption that an officer was acting in good faith if he or
she
was acting pursuant to a warrant,</B> but the ultimate question must still be whether the
officer undertook the search in the reasonable, good faith belief that it was proper.
People v. Altman, 960 P.2d 1164 (Colo. 1998); People v. Hagos, 250 P.3d 596 (Colo.
App.
2009).</T>
   <P></P>
   <T>
    <B>Police must act in objective good faith when applying for a warrant;</B> the
fact that a magistrate ultimately approved the warrant is not controlling. People v.
Miller, 75 P.3d 1108 (Colo. 2003).</T>
   <P></P>
   <T>
    <B>The court is restricted to the information contained within the four corners of the
affidavit.</B> Thus, it cannot bolster the insufficient affidavit with additional
information not conveyed to the magistrate in the application for the warrant. People v.
Miller, 75 P.3d 1108 (Colo. 2003).</T>
   <P></P>
   <T>
    <B>Good faith exception applies</B> when police are acting in
reasonable reliance on search warrant issued by detached and neutral
magistrate or judge, and the warrant is later found to be
unsupported by probable cause. Exception is applicable only when
such reliance is "objectively reasonable". People v. Titus, 880
P.2d 148 (Colo. 1994).</T>
   <P></P>
   <T>
    <B>The fact that same officer filed bare bones affidavit for warrant and executed
warrant</B> bolsters trial court's conclusion that the officer's reliance on the defective
affidavit was not objectively reasonable, and, consequently, the good faith exception to
the exclusionary rule did not apply to shield the evidence obtained in the search. People
v.
Pacheco, 175 P.3d 91 (Colo. 2006).</T>
   <P></P>
   <T>
    <B>But, it is not necessarily sufficient grounds to apply the exclusionary rule if
same officer who filed bare bones affidavit for warrant also executed warrant</B> so
long as the officer could show his or her reliance on the warrant was objectively
reasonable. People v. Hagos, 250 P.3d 596 (Colo. App. 2009).</T>
   <P></P>
   <T>
    <B>The determination by an appellate court that a warrant is invalid does not mean a
police officer's reliance upon that warrant was objectively unreasonable.</B>
People v. Altman, 960 P.2d 1164 (Colo. 1998).</T>
   <P></P>
   <T>
    <B>The fact that the affidavit details activities that are lawful does not cause it to be
a
bare bones affidavit;</B> a combination of otherwise lawful circumstances may well
lead
to a legitimate inference of criminal activity. People v. Altman, 960 P.2d 1164 (Colo.
1998).</T>
   <P></P>
   <T>
    <B>Arrest of a person other than the one named on the warrant does not
automatically preclude application of the good faith mistake exception to the
exclusionary rule.</B> If the police have reasonable grounds to believe the
suspect is the intended arrestee and the warrant is constitutionally valid,
the arrest of the suspect is generally valid. People v. Lewis, 813 P.2d 813

   <T>
    <B>Subsection (5) is constitutional on its face.</B> Subsection (5), which requires
a defendant to affirmatively request a laboratory technician's presence at trial, is an
acceptable precondition to a defendant's exercise of his right to confrontation and is
therefore not unconstitutional. A defendant's right to confrontation is not denied as he
can preserve that right, pursuant to this section, with minimal effort. People v.
Mojica-Simental, 73 P.3d 15 (Colo. 2003); People v. Martinez, 254 P.3d 1198 (Colo.
App.
2011).</T>
   <P></P>
   <T>The procedure provided in subsection (5) for ensuring the presence of the laboratory
technician at trial does not deny defendant the opportunity to cross-examine the
technician but simply requires that the defendant decide prior to trial whether defendant
will conduct a cross-examination. Subsection (5) provides the opportunity for
confrontation; only the timing of the defendant's decision is changed. Hinojos-Mendoza
v. People, 169 P.3d 662 (Colo. 2007); People v. Martinez, 254 P.3d 1198 (Colo. App.
2011).</T>
   <P></P>
   <T>Burden placed on defendant by subsection (5) to request the presence of the person
who prepared the report prior to trial was minimal and did not render subsection (5)
facially unconstitutional. Hinojos-Mendoza v. People, 169 P.3d 662 (Colo. 2007);
People
v.
Martinez, 254 P.3d 1198 (Colo. App. 2011).</T>
   <P></P>
   <T>
    <B>Criminal laboratory reports are testimonial statements</B> subject to the U.S.
supreme court's decision in Crawford v. Washington, 541 U.S. 36 (2004).
Hinojos-Mendoza v. People, 169 P.3d 662 (Colo. 2007).</T>
   <P></P>
   <T>The laboratory report was introduced at trial to establish the elements of the offense
with which defendant was charged, and, under such circumstances, the report is
testimonial in nature. Hinojos-Mendoza v. People, 169 P.3d 662 (Colo. 2007).</T>
   <P></P>
   <T>An autopsy report prepared by a doctor who was not present at trial should be
considered testimonial under Crawford. Because it was reasonable for the doctor to
assume the statements in the autopsy report would be used in a criminal prosecution, the
statements were testimonial under Crawford. People v. Merritt, 2014 COA 124, 411 P.3d
102.</T>
   <P></P>
   <T>
    <B>The plain meaning of "accomplish" in subsection (5) is "to execute fully:
perform, achieve, fulfill",</B> thus the prosecution should provide the person, regardless
of title, who was qualified and authorized to perform, and did perform, the tests;
observed
the results and interpreted them; and rendered expert conclusions regarding the identity
of
the controlled substances present in the sample or specimen. People v. Hill, 228 P.3d 171
(Colo. App. 2009).</T>
   <P></P>
   <T>
    <B>Lab supervisor's testimony satisfied the requirement of subsection (5) that the
laboratory testing technician who accomplished the analysis be made available at
trial,</B> even though the supervisor did not directly perform the screening and
confirmation tests. The supervisor reviewed the tests, analyzed the instrument data, and
reviewed notes of the lab analysts. The supervisor's review was necessary to fully execute
the requested urinalysis because, without this review, the results would not have been
certified as accurate and mailed to the police department. Therefore, the supervisor
accomplished the analysis for purposes of subsection (5). Marshall v. People, 2013 CO
51, 309 P.3d 943, cert. denied, 572 U.S. 1136, 134 S. Ct. 2661, 189 L. Ed. 2d 212
(2014).</T>
   <P></P>
   <T>
    <B>Testimony of a forensic toxicologist who led the process of reviewing the test
results, employed the quality control process, and certified the results by signing the
laboratory report satisfied the requirement of subsection (5)</B> even though the
toxicologist did not complete the original testing. The fact that the toxicologist did not
hold a formal supervisory position at the laboratory is immaterial. People v. Fuerst, 2019
COA 2, -- P.3d --.</T>
   <P></P>
   <T>
    <B>Nothing in the language of this section, its history, or in its purpose limits the
applicability of this section to "state-run" or "local law enforcement" laboratories as
defendant suggests.</B> The reference to "the criminalistics laboratory" in this section is
only a reference to the forensic laboratory that performed the test, the results of which are
submitted into evidence. People v. Martinez, 254 P.3d 1198 (Colo. App. 2011).</T>
   <P></P>
   <T>The limited application proposed by defendant is not a reasonable interpretation of
the statutory language. Nothing in the definition limits the practice of "criminalistics" to
state-run or local law enforcement laboratories. People v. Martinez, 254 P.3d 1198
(Colo. App. 2011).</T>
   <P></P>
   <T>
    <B>Defendant's rights under subsection (5) not violated</B> when laboratory
supervisor testified at trial even though she was not the person who analyzed defendant's
blood alcohol concentration. Because the test results could not have been approved and
certified without the supervisor's review, supervisor "performed the final and necessary
step" in the testing process, and therefore accomplished the analysis. People v.
Medrano-Bustamante, 2013 COA 139, 412 P.3d 581, aff'd in part and rev'd in part on
other grounds sub nom. Reyna-Abarca v. People, 2017
CO 15, 390 P.3d 816.</T>
   <P></P>
   <T>
    <B>By not complying with the procedural requirements of subsection (5), defense
counsel waived defendant's right to confront technician who prepared laboratory
report.</B> The right to confrontation falls into the class of rights that defense counsel
can waive through strategic decisions. Waiver of this right does not require a voluntary,
knowing, and intentional waiver by the defendant personally. Hinojos-Mendoza v.
People, 169 P.3d 662 (Colo. 2007); Coleman v. People, 169 P.3d 659 (Colo. 2007);
People
v. Martinez, 254 P.3d 1198 (Colo. App. 2011).</T>
   <P></P>
   <T>
    <B>A defense counsel's erroneous and unreasonable interpretation of this section
does not render involuntary a defendant's waiver of his confrontation rights.</B> People
v. Martinez, 254 P.3d 1198 (Colo. App. 2011).</T>
   <P></P>
   <T>
    <B>Defendant's attorney's failure to comply with subsection (5) waived defendant's
right to confront technician who prepared forensic report that was introduced without
technician's testimony.</B> Defendant's attorney's ignorance of the statute's requirements
does not affect the waiver of the right to confrontation. Defendant received sufficient
notice of the existence of the report and its possible introduction at trial. Cropper v.
People, 251 P.3d 434 (Colo. 2011).</T>
   <P></P>
   <T>
    <B>Before admitting a laboratory report pursuant to subsection (5), some factors the
trial court might consider include:</B> Whether an attorney or a pro se litigant actually
knew that he was required to notify the opposing party of his desire to have the
witness
present; the reasons why notice was late or was not given at all; the difficulty of
acquiring the presence of the witness; the significance to the case of the report and of the
testimony that would be elicited from the technician; and any other pertinent
circumstances. People v. Mojica-Simental, 73 P.3d 15 (Colo. 2003).</T>
   <P></P>
   <T>
    <B>Forensic laboratory reports are admissible in criminal proceedings without
establishing the usual foundation,</B> absent a request that the technician be made
available at trial. Testimony about the reports without admitting the reports into
evidence
does not deny defendant any rights to confrontation or cross-examination. People v.
Moses, 64 P.3d 904 (Colo. App. 2002).</T>
   <P></P>
   <T>
    <B>Specific requirement in subsection (5) of this section that laboratory testing
technician be made available at trial upon timely request overrides general hearsay
exception of C.R.E. 803(6).</B> When timely request had been made, trial court erred
in admitting laboratory report without technician's testimony as a business record.
People v. Williams, 183 P.3d 577 (Colo. App. 2007).</T>
   <P></P>
   <T>
    <B>A criminalistics laboratory report may be admitted in evidence in a driving
under the influence (DUI) trial without the laboratory technician's testimony</B>
because there is no conflict with the general DUI statute, and the constitutional right to
confrontation is not violated on its face by requiring the defendant to affirmatively assert
such right by requesting the technician to testify. However, a lack of actual notice of the
opportunity to require the technician to testify or a mistaken failure to request the
testimony may not constitute a voluntary waiver of the right to confrontation. People v.
Mojica-Simental, 73 P.3d 15 (Colo. 2003).</T>
   <P></P>
   <T>
    <B>Court abused its discretion</B> when it committed to suppress results for tests
that had not yet been conducted unless the prosecution allowed the testing to be
videotaped or agreed to pay the cost of the defense expert to view the testing. The court
was in no position to assess the reasonableness of future conduct. People v. Wartena,
156
P.3d 469 (Colo. 2007).</T>
   <P></P>
   <T>
    <B>Court did not err in admitting the lab test through a police officer.</B> The
defendant did not file the statutorily required request for the technician to testify in
person, so the report could be introduced through another person familiar with the report.
The officer did not provide expert testimony in introducing the lab test, so the admission
of the report was appropriate. People v. Santana, 240 P.3d 302 (Colo. App. 2009), rev'd
on
other grounds, 255 P.3d 1126 (Colo. 2011).</T>

    <B>Statement during process of booking was voluntary.</B>
The identification, during the process of booking of defendants, of a
baggage locker key as part of personal property, with the added
statement, "Go see for yourself", cannot be challenged as not voluntary
merely because defendant's father was not called before defendant was
booked; nor can the failure to take defendant before a judge before defendant
was booked affect the voluntariness of the identification of his personal
belongings. Hubbard v. Patterson, 374 F.2d 856 (10th Cir.), cert.
denied, 389 US 868, 88 S. Ct. 142, 19 L. Ed. 2d 144 (1967) (decided

    <B>Annotator's note.</B> Since § 16-4-101 is similar to § 16-4-101 as it

under
former provisions similar to that section have been included in the annotations to this

   <T>
    <B>Purpose of bail</B> is to insure the defendant's presence at the time
of trial and not to punish a defendant before he has been convicted.
Lucero v. District Court, 188 Colo. 67, 532 P.2d 955 (1975).</T>
   <P></P>
   <T>
    <B>Proviso refers to proof of guilt.</B> The requirement in the
constitution that capital offenses are nonbailable when "the proof is
evident or the presumption great" simply goes to the proof of guilt,
not to the kind of proof needed for the imposition of the death penalty.
Corbett v. Patterson, 272 F. Supp. 602 (D. Colo. 1967).</T>
   <P></P>
   <T>
    <B>Offense does not cease to be capital where death penalty may not
be imposed.</B> Although by statute the death penalty cannot be
imposed on the basis of only circumstantial evidence, the petitioner
does not cease to be charged with a capital offense and thus become
entitled to bail as a matter of right where the prosecution probably
did not have the direct evidence necessary to seek the death penalty.
The offense with which he was charged was still a capital one,
even if it should later develop that the type of evidence
adduced did not support a verdict imposing the death penalty.
Corbett v. Patterson, 272 F. Supp. 602 (D. Colo. 1967).</T>
   <P></P>
   <T>
    <B>And denial of bail unaffected by constitutionality of death penalty.</B>
The United States supreme court decision prohibiting imposition of death
penalty in the circumstances then before it did not preclude denial of
bail pursuant to state constitutional provision that bail may be denied
where capital offense is charged when the proof is evident, or the presumption
great, that defendant has committed the charged offense. People ex rel.

is greater than probable cause though less than that required for a conviction.

   <P></P>
   <T>
    <B>Burden on prosecution to show nonbailable case.</B>
If bail is to be denied, it is incumbent upon the prosecution
to come forward and show that the proof is evident or the presumption
great that the crime set forth was committed by the defendant, but if
evidence is not presented by the prosecution, it is incumbent upon the
court, looking to the guidelines laid down by statute, to set reasonable
bail in compliance with the Colorado constitution and the eighth
amendment of the constitution of the United States. People ex rel.
Dunbar v. District Court, 179 Colo. 304, 500 P.2d 358 (1972).</T>

   <T>The burden is upon the prosecution to show that the exception to the right
to bail is applicable, and only with that showing can the conditional freedom
secured by bail properly be denied. Gladney v. District Court, 188

   <P></P>
   <T>
    <B>Denial of bail not foreclosed by fact that defendant was minor.</B>
The fact that defendant was 16 years of age, a minor, who could not be subjected
to the death penalty, would not have foreclosed the denial of bail.
Lucero v. District Court, 188 Colo. 67, 532 P.2d 955 (1975).</T>
   <P></P>
   <T>
    <B>Mere filing of an information or the production of evidence which
would establish probable cause</B> that the crimes charged were committed
will not meet the Colorado constitutional standard for denying bail
in capital cases. Lucero v. District Court, 188 Colo. 67, 532 P.2d 955 (1975).</T>
   <P></P>
   <T>
    <B>Trial judge exceeded jurisdiction but did not lose right to revoke or
modify bail.</B> The trial judge exceeded his jurisdiction by equating probable
cause to the Colorado constitutional standard for denying bail in capital
cases and by imposing an impermissible condition on the defendant at the time
bail was granted. However, the right of the court to revoke or modify bail
which has been previously granted after notice is given to the defendant
was not negated. Lucero v. District Court, 188 Colo. 67, 532 P.2d 955 (1975).</T>
   <P></P>
   <T>
    <B>Only criminal defendants vested with legal rights in bail.</B>
Statutory provisions concerning bail do not purport to vest any
persons other than criminal defendants with any legal rights in the
determination of the terms, amount, or conditions of bail.

    <B>When juvenile detainable without bail.</B>
A trial court may detain a juvenile without bail only after giving due weight
to the presumption that a juvenile should be released pending a dispositional
hearing except in narrowly defined circumstances where the state establishes
that detention is necessary to protect the child from imminent harm or to
protect others in the community from serious bodily harm which the child
is likely to inflict. L.O.W. v. District Court, 623 P.2d 1253 (Colo.

    <B>In the event a new trial is granted in a capital case,</B> the court is required to

  <CATCH-LINE>
   <RHFTO>16-4-102</RHFTO>.<M>Right to bail - before
conviction.</M>
  </CATCH-LINE>
(1)<M>Any person who is in custody, and for whom the court has not set bond and
conditions of release pursuant to the applicable rule of criminal procedure, and who is
not
subject to the provisions of section 16-4-101 (5), has the right to a hearing to determine
bond and conditions of release. A person in custody may also request a hearing so that
bond and conditions of release can be set. Upon receiving the request, the judge shall
notify the district attorney immediately of the arrested person's request, and the district
attorney has the right to attend and advise the court of matters pertinent to the type of
bond and conditions of release to be set. The judge shall also order the appropriate law
enforcement agency having custody of the prisoner to bring him or her before the court
forthwith, and the judge shall set bond and conditions of release if the offense for which
the person was arrested is bailable. It is not a prerequisite to bail that a criminal charge of
any kind has been filed.</M>
  <P N="(2)(a)(I)"></P>
  <T>(2)<N></N>(a)<N></N>(I)<M>The arresting jurisdiction shall bring an in-custody arrestee
before a court for bond setting as soon as practicable, but no later than forty-eight hours
after an arrestee arrives at a jail or holding facility. A judge, magistrate, or bond hearing
officer shall hold a hearing with an in-custody arrestee at which the court shall enter an
individualized bond order as soon as practicable, but no later than forty-eight hours after
an arrestee arrives at a jail or holding facility. Notwithstanding the requirement for bond
setting within forty-eight hours, it is not a violation of this section if a bond hearing is not
held within forty-eight hours when the delay is caused by an emergency that requires the
court to close or circumstances in which the defendant refuses to attend court, is unable
to
attend court due to a debilitating physical ailment, or is unable to proceed due to drug or
alcohol use or mental illness. Use of audiovisual conferencing technology is permissible
to expedite bond setting hearings, including prior to extradition of the defendant from
one
county to another in the state of Colorado. When high-speed internet access is
unavailable, making audiovisual conferencing impossible, the court may conduct the
hearing telephonically.</M>
  </T>
  <P N="(2)(a)(II)"></P>
  <T>(II)<M>This subsection (2)(a) applies only to the initial bond setting by a judge.</M>
  </T>
  <P N="(2)(a)(III)"></P>
  <T>(III)<M>This subsection (2)(a) applies to an arrestee who was arrested on or after
April 1, 2022.</M>
  </T>
  <P N="(2)(b)(I)"></P>
  <T>(b)<N></N>(I)<M>A judge, judicial officer, or bond hearing officer shall not require a
monetary bond to be paid in the defendant's name. Bond may be paid, at a minimum, by
cash, money order, or cashier's check. If bond is paid by money order or cashier's check,
the money order or cashier's check may be payable to the holding county. Before bond is
posted, the sheriff shall provide the defendant and surety, if any, a copy of the notice
described in subsection (2)(h)(I) of this section. When the bond is posted, the sheriff
shall
provide the defendant and surety, if any, a copy of the bond paperwork and information
regarding the defendant's next court date. The individual processing the bond shall
certify,
in writing, that the payor received a copy of the bond paperwork, the notice described in
subsection (2)(h)(I) of this section, and information regarding the defendant's next court
date and shall place a copy of the certification in the defendant's file. Notwithstanding
the
provisions of this section, a sheriff may allow an individual to choose to stay in jail
overnight after release when extenuating circumstances exist, including inclement
weather, lack of transportation, or lack of shelter.</M>
  </T>
  <P N="(2)(b)(II)"></P>
  <T>(II)<M>By January 1, 2022, each jail shall establish a means to pay bond online
without the need for the payor to go to the jail in person to pay bond.</M>
  </T>
  <P N="(2)(c)"></P>
  <T>(c)<M>The custodian of a jail shall ensure the defendant, a
surety on behalf of the
defendant, or another third party on behalf of the defendant is not charged more than a
ten-dollar bond processing fee.</M>
  </T>
  <P N="(2)(d)"></P>
  <T>(d)<M>The custodian of a jail shall also ensure the defendant, a
surety on behalf of
the defendant, or another third party on behalf of the defendant is not charged any
additional transaction fees including kiosk fees; except that the standard credit card
processing fee that the credit card company charges may be charged when a credit card is
used, or, when a third-party vendor provides defendants the option to pay monetary bond
with a credit card, the defendant can be required to pay up to a three-and-one-half
percent
credit card payment processing fee.</M>
  </T>
  <P N="(2)(e)"></P>
  <T>(e)<M>Unless extraordinary circumstances exist, the custodian of a jail shall release
a defendant who is granted a personal recognizance bond as soon as practicable but no
later than six hours after the defendant is physically present in the jail. Unless
extraordinary circumstances exist, the custodian of a jail shall release a defendant who is
granted a cash bond as soon as practicable but no later than six hours after bond is set,
after the defendant is physically present in the jail, and after the defendant or surety
notifies the jail that the defendant or surety is prepared to post bond. If the custodian fails
to release the defendant within six hours, the custodian shall inform the defendant and
any person posting bond on behalf of the defendant the reason for the delay and shall
document the reason for the delay in the defendant's file. A supervisory condition of
release does not serve as a legal basis to continue to detain the defendant; except that, if
the defendant is ordered released upon condition of being subject to electronic
monitoring, the defendant may be held up to as long as practicable but no longer than
twenty-four hours after the defendant is physically present in the jail and the defendant's
bond has been posted, if such delay is necessary to ensure the defendant is fitted with
electronic monitoring and the court has authorized the defendant to be held until the
electronic monitor is fitted. If the court orders electronic monitoring for the protection of
a specific individual, and the defendant is ordered to have no contact with that specific
individual, and the judge orders that the defendant not be released without electronic
monitoring based on finding that the electronic monitoring is necessary for public safety,
then the time limits regarding release of the defendant in this subsection (2)(e) do not
apply. However, if a defendant is held more than twenty-four hours after posting bond
awaiting electronic monitoring fitting, the sheriff shall bring the defendant to the court
the
next day the court is in session and explain the reason for the delay.</M>
  </T>
  <P N="(2)(f)"></P>
  <T>(f)<M>A defendant who has posted bond must be released

victim is deceased, has the right to be present and heard at the hearing. People v. Blagg,
2015 CO 2, 340 P.3d 1137.</T>
   <P></P>
   <T>
    <B>The power to fix bail cannot be delegated.</B> In the absence of a statute
providing otherwise, the court or judicial officer vested with the power to fix
bail cannot delegate such power to another. But where such power has been
exercised by the proper court or officer, the act of taking and approving the
bail bond is a ministerial act which may be delegated without statutory
authority. Bottom v. People, 63 Colo. 114, 164 P. 697 (1917).</T>

   <T>But denial of bail may not be predicated upon hearsay alone,

    <B>When child detainable without bail.</B>
A trial court may detain a juvenile without bail only after giving due weight
to the presumption that a juvenile should be released pending a dispositional
hearing except in narrowly defined circumstances where the state establishes
that detention is necessary to protect the child from imminent harm or to
protect others in the community from serious bodily harm which the child
is likely to inflict. L.O.W. v. District Court, 623 P.2d 1253 (Colo. 1981).</T>

   <P></P>
   <T>
    <B>Annotator's note.</B> Since § 16-4-103 is similar to § 16-4-103 as it
existed prior to the 2013 repeal and reenactment of this part 1, relevant cases decided
under
that provision and former provisions similar to that section have been included in the
annotations to this section.</T>
   <P></P>
   <T>
    <B>The sole purpose and function of a bail bond is to produce the
defendant in court</B> then and there to answer unto a certain information
herein pending against him. Herbertson v. People, 160 Colo. 139, 415 P.2d 53
(1966).</T>
   <P></P>
   <T>
    <B>Conditions not specified in this section are not binding upon the
surety.</B> The condition that the principal "abide the order of the court"
is of this character. Tanquary v. People, 25 Colo. App. 531, 139 P. 1118 (1914).</T>
   <P></P>
   <T>
    <B>Proper imposition of conditions.</B> The imposition of conditions
relating to the defendant's right to remain at liberty on bail that
comply with the constitution is in keeping with the recommendations of
the standards for criminal justice. Lucero v. District Court, 188 Colo. 67,
532 P.2d 955 (1975).</T>
   <P></P>
   <T>
    <B>However, the trial judge imposed an improper and unconstitutional
condition</B>
where the bail order included the following condition: "If probable cause
shall be shown to this court that any of the above offenses shall have been
committed by either defendant, bond for that particular defendant shall be
immediately terminated."
However, the right of the court to revoke or modify bail
which has been previously granted after notice is given to the defendant
was not negated. Lucero v. District Court, 188 Colo. 67,
532 P.2d 955 (1975).</T>
   <P></P>
   <T>The trial judge imposed an improper and unconstitutional condition where
bail bond included condition that defendant arrested on domestic violence
charges and alcohol-related misdemeanors and his agents could have no contact
with victim. Although the condition was reasonably related to the statutory
criterion that the court protect possible witnesses and victims from
intimidation or harassment by the defendant, it also interfered with
defendant's
right to have his counsel effectively represent him at trial by investigating
the facts surrounding the alleged event and preparing for trial. Defendant
does not, however, have the right to personally contact the victim, her
family, or witnesses. Martell v. County Court of Summit County, 854 P.2d
1327 (Colo. App. 1992).</T>
   <P></P>
   <T>The trial judge erred in ordering defendant arrested on domestic
violence
charges and alcohol-related misdemeanors to attend counseling for abusive men
as a condition of bond since such counseling may encourage or even
require participants to admit their abusive behavior. Such counseling before
conviction implicates defendant's fifth amendment privilege against
self-incrimination and the presumption of innocence. Martell v. County Court
of Summit County, 854 P.2d 1327 (Colo. App. 1992).</T>
   <P></P>
   <T>
    <B>Statute provides accelerated docket for defendants held in custody.</B>
The plain intent of the statute is to provide for an accelerated docket for those defendants
who are
being held in jail pending trial as a result of the revocation of their prior release on bond,
for
certain specified reasons, or as a result of an increase in the amount of bond, which
would
cause
them to remain in custody.
People v. Olds, 656 P.2d 705 (Colo. 1983) (disapproved in People v. Mascarenas,
706 P.2d 404 (Colo. 1985)).</T>
   <P></P>
   <T>By this section, the legislature meant to enhance speedy trial rights of those who are
kept
in
jail due to revoked bail or increased bail after the issue of their guilt has been raised by a
plea
of
not guilty. People v. Olds, 656 P.2d 705 (Colo. 1983) (disapproved in People
v. Mascarenas, 706 P.2d 404 (Colo. 1985));
People v. Fields, 697 P.2d 749 (Colo. App. 1984).</T>
   <P></P>
   <T>
    <B>And is not to benefit one who misses preliminary hearing.</B>
The general assembly did not intend that one accused of the commission of an offense
should
be
permitted to profit from his failure to appear at the preliminary hearing and be in a better
position
than those other defendants who were released on bond and who had not violated the
terms
of
their bond, or those defendants who had been unable to
post bail initially and who had remained incarcerated
for the entire pretrial period after arrest.
People v. Olds, 656 P.2d 705 (Colo. 1983) (disapproved in People v. Mascarenas,
706 P.2d 404 (Colo. 1985)).</T>
   <P></P>
   <T>
    <B>A second bail bond</B>
entered after the defendant was returned to the custody of the court
was not an increase of the first bond, which was forfeited and ceased to exist
after the defendant failed to appear at his preliminary hearing. Therefore,
the defendant's speedy trial rights were not violated when he was not brought
to trial within ninety days after entry of the second bond.
People v. Armendariz, 684 P.2d 252 (Colo. App. 1983).</T>
   <P></P>
   <T>
    <B>Defendant whose bail was revoked following finding that proof was evident and
presumption great in capital offense case</B> pursuant to Art. II,
§ 19, Colo. Const., had no right to trial within 90 days of
revocation. People v. Avery, 736 P.2d 1233 (Colo. App. 1986).</T>
   <P></P>
   <T>
    <B>Defendant on bond may leave jurisdiction unless ordered otherwise.</B>
Generally, unless the court orders or the surety stipulates otherwise, nothing
prevents a defendant on bond from leaving the jurisdiction so long as he
appears at all proceedings in his case. People v. Rincon, 43 Colo. App.
155, 603 P.2d 953 (1979).</T>
   <P></P>
   <T>
    <B>Subsection (2) modifications permitted only after arraignment.</B>
The bail modifications which are the subject of subsection (2) relate only to those bail
proceedings
which occur after arraignment.
People v. Olds, 656 P.2d 705 (Colo. 1983) (disapproved in People v. Mascarenas,
706 P.2d 404 (Colo. 1985));
People v. Armedariz, 684 P.2d 252 (Colo. App. 1983).</T>
   <P></P>
   <T>
    <B>The term "supervision" used in subsection (2) does not include mandatory
counseling</B> as a condition of bond for defendant arrested on domestic violence
charges and alcohol-related misdemeanors. Martell v. County Court of
Summit County, 854 P.2d 1327 (Colo. App. 1992).</T>

subject to the relevant statutory conditions of release listed in section 16-4-105. The
person may be released upon execution of:</M>

post with the court in order for the person to be released. The person may be released
from custody upon execution of bond in the full amount of money to be secured by any
one of the following methods, as selected by the person to be released, unless the court
makes factual findings on the record with respect to the person to be released that a
certain method of bond, as selected by the court, is necessary to ensure the appearance of
the person in court or the safety of any person, persons, or the community:</M>
  </T>
  <P N="(1)(c)(I)"></P>

  </T>
  <P N="(1)(d)"></P>
  <T>(d)<M>A bond with secured real estate conditions when it is determined that release
on
an unsecured personal recognizance bond without monetary conditions will not
reasonably
ensure the appearance of the person in court or the safety of any person or persons or the

of
the court unless the record owner of such property presents to the clerk of the court the
original deed of trust as set forth in subparagraph (IV) of this paragraph (d) and the
applicable recording fee. Upon receipt of the deed of trust and fee, the clerk of the court

encumbrances certificate from the actual value of such real estate as shown on the current
notice of valuation. The owner of the real estate shall file with the bond the following,

(1)<M>The chief judge of any judicial district may order a person who is eligible for
bond
or other pretrial release to be evaluated by a pretrial services program established
pursuant
to this section, which program may advise the court if the person is bond eligible, may
provide information that enables the court to make an appropriate decision on bond and
conditions of release, and may recommend conditions of release consistent with this
section.
The chief judge may make such order in any or all of the counties of the chief judge's
judicial
district.</M>
  <P N="(2)"></P>
  <T>(2)<M>The chief judge of any judicial district shall endeavor to consult, on an
annual
basis, with the county or counties within the judicial district in an effort to support and
encourage the development by the county or counties, to the extent practicable and
within
available resources, of pretrial services programs that support the work of the court and
evidence-based decision-making in determining the type of bond and conditions of
release.</M>
  </T>
  <P N="(3)"></P>
  <T>(3)<M>To reduce barriers to the pretrial release of persons in custody whose release
on
bond with appropriate conditions reasonably assures court appearance and public safety,
all
counties and cities and counties are encouraged to develop a pretrial services program in
consultation with the chief judge of the judicial district in an effort to establish a pretrial
services program that may be utilized by the district court of such county or city and
county.
Any pretrial services program must be established pursuant to a plan formulated by a
community advisory board created for such purpose and appointed by the chief judge of
the
judicial district. Membership on such community advisory board must include, at a
minimum,
a representative of a local law enforcement agency, a representative of the district
attorney,
a representative of the public defender, and a representative of the citizens at large. The
chief
judge is encouraged to appoint to the community advisory board at least one
representative
of the bail bond industry who conducts business in the judicial district, which may
include
a bail bondsman, a bail surety, or other designated bail industry representative. The plan
formulated by such community advisory board must be approved by the chief judge of
the
judicial district prior to the establishment and utilization of the pretrial services program.
The
option contained in this section that a pretrial services program be established pursuant
to
a plan formulated by the community advisory board does not apply to any pretrial
services
program that existed before May 31, 1991.</M>

detained due to an arrest for the alleged commission of a crime so that such information
may
be provided to the judge who is setting the bond and conditions of release. The program
must
provide information that provides the court with the ability to make an appropriate initial
bond decision that is based upon facts relating to the person's risk of failure to appear for
court and risk of danger to the community.</M>
  </T>
  <P N="(4)(b)"></P>
  <T>(b)<M>The program must make all reasonable attempts to provide the court with

information delineated in this section as is appropriate to each individual person seeking

  <T>(c)<M>The program, in conjunction with the community advisory board, must make
all reasonable efforts to implement an empirically developed pretrial risk assessment tool,
to be used by the program, the court, and the parties to the case solely for the purpose of
assessing pretrial risk, and a structured decision-making design based upon the person's
charge and the risk assessment score; and</M>
  </T>
  <P N="(4)(d)"></P>
  <T>(d)<M>The program must work with all appropriate agencies and assist with all
efforts

  </T>
  <P N="(5)"></P>
  <T>(5)<M>Any pretrial services program may also include different methods and levels
of
community-based supervision as a condition of release, and the program must use
established
methods for persons who are released prior to trial in order to decrease unnecessary
pretrial
detention. The program may include, but is not limited to, any of the criteria as outlined
in
section 16-4-105 (8) as conditions for pretrial release.</M>
  </T>
  <P N="(6)"></P>
  <T>(6)<M>Commencing July 1, 2012, each pretrial services program established
pursuant to this section shall provide an annual report to the judicial department no later

31, 1991. Notwithstanding section 24-1-136 (11)(a)(I), the judicial department shall
present an annual combined report to the house and senate judiciary committees of the
house of representatives and the senate, or any successor committees, of the general
assembly. The report to the judicial department must include, but is not limited to, the

  </CATCH-LINE>
Once a bond has been executed and the person released from
custody thereon, whether a charge is then pending or is thereafter filed or transferred to a
court of competent jurisdiction, the original bond shall continue in effect until final
disposition of the case in the trial court. If a charge filed in the county court is dismissed and
the district attorney states on the record that the charge will be refiled in the district court or
that the dismissal by the county court will be appealed to the district court, the county court
before entering the dismissal shall fix a return date, not later than sixty-three days thereafter,
upon which the defendant must appear in the district court and continue the bond. Any bond
continued pursuant to this section is subject to the provisions of section 16-4-109.</SECTION-TEXT>

    <B>Annotator's note.</B> Since § 16-4-108 is similar to § 16-4-106 as it
existed prior to the 2013 repeal and reenactment of this part 1, relevant cases decided under
that provision and former provisions similar to that section have been included in the
annotations to this section.</T>
   <P></P>
   <T>
    <B>Purpose of section.</B> The purpose of § 16-4-201
concerning bail after conviction and this section is to authorize
the court to exercise discretion rather than follow a fixed policy
and to permit a recognizance to remain in effect, without the
necessity of a new bond, after conviction and until disposition of the
case in the trial court. Trujillo v. District Court, 131 Colo.
428, 282 P.2d 703 (1955).</T>

    <B>This section and § 16-4-201 must be read together

   <P></P>
   <T>
    <B>And trial court could not continue bond without first
obtaining surety's consent.</B> Rodriguez v. People, 191 Colo. 540, 554 P.2d 291
(1976).</T>
   <P></P>
   <T>Although the trial judge may continue the original bond
to final disposition, he must obtain the consent of the surety
to continue it beyond conviction. Rodriguez v. People,
191 Colo. 540, 554 P.2d 291 (1976).</T>
   <P></P>
   <T>
    <B>Increase of surety's risk without his consent terminates obligation.</B>
When one undertakes a surety obligation, the surety undertakes a calculated risk, and
events
which materially increase that risk without consent of the surety terminate the obligation
of
the
bond.
People v. Smith, 645 P.2d 864 (Colo. App. 1982).</T>
   <P></P>
   <T>
    <B>Effect of resettings of the case.</B> Where there were resettings
of a criminal case for trial at the same term, the contention of a
surety on defendant's bond that he was discharged
by these continuances without his consent was overruled. Van Gilder
v. People, 75 Colo. 515, 227 P. 386 (1924).</T>

Where a defendant fails to appear at a scheduled hearing, then, through

not extradited and returned to custody in Colorado, a trial judge abuses

If, at the same time, a certified copy of the recognizance is delivered to the

acknowledge the surrender. People v. Loomis, 60 Colo. 202, 152 P. 143 (1915).</T>

   <T>
    <B>Surrender effective before final disposition of the case.</B>
A surety on a criminal recognizance may be released from liability thereon
by the surrender of the principal, even after forfeiture and judgment
against him on the bond, if he acts before final disposition of the case,
extending to a review on error. Van Gilder v. City &amp; County of Denver,
104 Colo. 76, 89 P.2d 529 (1939).</T>
   <P></P>
   <T>
    <B>But appearance for trial is not a surrender.</B> The appearance of the
defendant in a criminal case in court for trial is not equivalent to a surrender
of his person by a surety on his bond. Van Gilder v. People, 75 Colo. 515,
227 P. 386 (1924).</T>
   <P></P>
   <T>
    <B>Nor is incarceration after appearance date.</B> The rule that incarceration
of a principal on the return date of his bond permits relief from forfeiture of
the bond has no application where the principal was at large and was not imprisoned
until 30 days after the date he was to appear in Colorado, and the surety,
through its agent, had the opportunity to return the principal to
Colorado before judgment was entered and thus be absolved under our statutes
of any liability other than costs incurred by the people by reason of the
principal's failure to appear. Union Benefit Fire Ins. Co. v. People, 160
Colo. 211, 416 P.2d 368 (1966).</T>
   <P></P>
   <T>
    <B>However, surety not liable if principal is arrested and jailed for
another offense.</B> Under this section where, after forfeiture but before
judgment against the sureties, their principal was arrested and placed in
the jail of the county under a different charge than that for which the bond was
given, the sureties were entitled to a discharge from liability upon
their formal offer to surrender and the payment of the costs, although
they did nothing towards the rearresting and returning to custody of the prisoner.
And they were not liable for costs incurred in arresting and returning their principal
under a different charge than the one in which the bond was given. Huston v.
People ex rel. Collins, 12 Colo. App. 271, 55 P. 262 (1898).</T>
   <P></P>
   <T>
    <B>Or if a cause brought by the state is in fact abandoned</B>
by the state, by reason of which the presence of the accused in
court is no longer required or desired for trial or matters incident
thereto, the purpose of the bail bond has been served, its function
fulfilled and performed, and it should thenceforth be regarded as functus
officio and the formal discharge of defendant and of his sureties
therefrom should be entered upon application. Herbertson v. People,

   <P></P>
   <T>
    <B>Surety needs not personally accomplish the seizure and surrender.</B>
Where defendant was stopped for a traffic offense and was taken into
custody by sheriff's deputies on the outstanding warrant, surety was entitled
to exoneration under this section. People v. Madison, 909 P.2d 551 (Colo.
App. 1995).</T>
   <P></P>
   <T>
    <B>The term "costs",</B> as used in this section, includes
whatever the law officers may legitimately pay out, or have a right to charge,
in connection with the return of the criminal for trial. Ayres v. People,

   <P></P>
   <T>
    <B>Liability of surety for costs.</B> Sureties must pay the expenses
incurred by the county in procuring the return of their principal
from another state upon a requisition. Ayres v. People, 3 Colo. App.
117, 32 P. 77 (1893).</T>
   <P></P>
   <T>To accomplish the purpose of giving bail, courts have been
liberal in vacating judgments entered on bail bonds, exercising always
a broad discretion and in proper cases preserving the equities of the
public by deducting such costs and expenses as may have been
incurred by the state. To hold otherwise would discourage the
giving of bail and defeat the manifest purpose of the statute.

   <P></P>
   <T>
    <B>When court may require return of premium.</B>
A court has the discretion to require a surety to return all or a portion of the premium

bail bond where the bond is terminated by court order.

   <P></P>
   <T>
    <B>Subsection (1)(c) takes precedence over bond provisions.</B>
The language of subsection (1)(c) protecting against unjust enrichment takes precedence
over,
and nullifies, a provision in a bond purporting to make a bond premium nonrefundable.
People v. Walker, 665 P.2d 154 (Colo. App. 1983),
aff'd sub nom. Yording v. Walker, 683 P.2d 788 (Colo. 1984) (decided prior
to enactment of subsection (1)(d) in 1985).</T>
   <P></P>
   <T>
    <B>Subsection (1.5) is broader than the rule in Yording</B> in that it permits a

under
circumstances other than an error of law, subject to the time limitation. People v.

   <P></P>
   <T>
    <B>This section does not grant authority to the court to refund a bond premium to a
defendant whose surrender occurred after the defendant's required initial
appearance.</B> Under subsection (1)(d), a court may order return of the premium to
prevent unjust enrichment only if the surrender occurred prior to a defendant's initial
appearance. People v. Fallis, 2017 COA 131M, -- P.3d --.</T>
   <P></P>
   <T>
    <B>Reincarceration of the defendant on separate charges is not included among the
additional
grounds for exoneration of the surety.</B> People v. Goldsmith, 955 P.2d 561 (Colo.

   <P></P>
   <T>
    <B>Even though both subsections (1)(c) and (1.5) were inapplicable, court had

   <T>
    <B>Judgment for penal sum or costs allowed.</B> When it appears that the
defendant was pursued, apprehended, and returned by the state, without
any assistance from those answerable for his appearance, judgment should be
entered for the penal sum of the bond, unless the court, in light
of all of the circumstances surrounding defendant's failure to appear
in the exercise of its sound discretion may see fit to enter judgment
for a lesser amount. In no event should judgment be entered for an amount
less than the full amount of costs occasioned by the defendant's failure
to appear. People v. Johnson, 155 Colo. 392, 395 P.2d 19 (1964).</T>

   <P></P>
   <T>
    <B>Surety should act promptly where recognizance forfeited.</B> A surety
on a criminal recognizance which has been forfeited who wishes to obtain
relief from liability should act promptly and while evidence against the
defendant is still available. Van Gilder v. City &amp; County of Denver,
104 Colo. 76, 89 P.2d 529 (1939).</T>
   <P></P>
   <T>
    <B>Acts of God, of the state, or of law relieve a surety from liability.</B>
A trial court has no jurisdiction to relieve the surety from liability
on a bail bond except on grounds generally recognized by the law as
excusing the performance of the undertaking, and such grounds exist
only when the appearance of accused is made impossible by an act
of God, an act of the state which is the beneficiary of the bond, or an
act of law. Where the principal in a bail bond dies before the day of
performance or is prevented by illness from appearing, the case is
within the first category. Where the principal in a bail bond is in
prison within the state, pursuant to a judgment of a court of competent
jurisdiction of the state, the case comes within the second category.
Where the party has been turned over to the federal court within the
state by a prior bondsman and is serving a sentence by that court,
or if the party has been arrested in the state where the obligation is
given and sent out of the state by the governor upon requisition from
another state or foreign jurisdiction, the case falls within the third
category. Allison v. People, 132 Colo. 156, 286 P.2d 1102 (1955).</T>
   <P></P>
   <T>Where the defendant in a criminal case is imprisoned in another
state at the time his case is called for trial and cannot appear pursuant
to the conditions of his bond, and the surety thereon offers to defray
the costs and expenses involved in returning the defendant to Colorado
upon completion of the imprisonment which prevented his attendance
in the trial court, the surety is relieved from a forfeiture. Allison v.
People, 132 Colo. 156, 286 P.2d 1102 (1955).</T>
   <P></P>
   <T>Where the defendant is not produced at all, or turns
up only after a long lapse of time, the courts will ordinarily
deny remission without regard to the mitigating factors asserted
in connection with his nonappearance, except in cases of death,
insanity, or imprisonment. People v. Johnson, 155 Colo. 392, 395 P.2d
19 (1964).</T>
   <P></P>
   <T>
    <B>Defendant who is transferred from the state's custody to a federal agency</B>
pursuant
to a detainer has never been released into the legal custody
of the surety who is consequently discharged from any
liability on the bond. People v. Gonzales, 745 P.2d 263 (Colo. App. 1987).</T>
   <P></P>
   <T>
    <B>Hospitalization is valid excuse for failure to appear.</B>
The defendant's hospitalization following an automobile accident is a valid excuse for his
failure to
appear at a scheduled hearing.
People v. Smith, 673 P.2d 1026 (Colo. App. 1983).</T>
   <P></P>
   <T>
    <B>The standard in subsection (3) is essentially an appeal to
the conscience of the court.</B> No clear rule can be set down
which will guide the trial court in every case since the facts
and circumstances of each individual case must be considered in
their totality. No one factor will be determinative in all cases.
Owens v. People, 194 Colo. 389, 572 P.2d 837 (1977).</T>
   <P></P>
   <T>
    <B>And court has discretion to relieve forfeiture for other reasons.</B>
Following the rule that the discretion is in the court to do as it
sees fit about forfeiting a bond, matters which would appeal to the
sympathy of the ordinary individual, even if not to a judge, should
be put in evidence. Allison v. People, 132 Colo. 156, 286 P.2d 1102 (1955).</T>
   <P></P>
   <T>The decision as to whether or not a forfeited bond should be
remitted is entrusted to the trial court's discretion by subsection
(3) of this section and Crim. P. 46.
Owens v. People, 194 Colo. 389, 572 P.2d 837 (1977).</T>
   <P></P>
   <T>Trial court abused its discretion where the sureties made substantial efforts to locate,
seize,
and surrender defendant to authorities, and defendant was in custody in the adjoining
county
due
principally to the efforts of the sureties. People v. Mendez, 708 P.2d 126 (Colo. App.
1985).</T>
   <P></P>
   <T>
    <B>Forfeiture proceeding not to enrich public treasury.</B>
The enriching of the public treasury is not part of the object at which
a forfeiture proceeding is aimed. People v. Campbell,
633 P.2d 509 (Colo. App. 1981).</T>
   <P></P>
   <T>
    <B>Effect of material increase of risk to bondsman.</B>
When a bondsman enters into a surety agreement, he undertakes
a calculated risk, so that events which materially increase
that risk have the effect of terminating the obligation.
People v. Calloway, 40 Colo. App. 543, 577 P.2d 1109 (1978).</T>
   <P></P>
   <T>
    <B>Court not required to notify surety of defendant's permitted absence.</B>
Neither the case law nor subsection (2) imposes a duty on the court to give a surety
notice
of the
permitted absence of a defendant from a hearing.
People v. Smith, 673 P.2d 1026 (Colo. App. 1983).</T>
   <P></P>
   <T>
    <B>By approving defendant's departure from state without notice
to surety,</B> the court terminates any control the surety might
have had over the defendant and the court's action discharges
the surety from any obligation under a bail bond.
People v. Calloway, 40 Colo. App. 543, 577 P.2d 1109 (1978).</T>
   <P></P>
   <T>
    <B>Words "without leave" in the bond do not include departure from the
jurisdiction</B> of
the court. But where the defendant given permission to absent himself only from the
court
and
not from the
court's jurisdiction, the court complies with the existing conditions of the bond contract,
rather
than changing them, materially or otherwise.
People v. Smith, 673 P.2d 1026 (Colo. App. 1983).</T>
   <P></P>
   <T>
    <B>Considerations in determining whether to order remission of forfeited
bond.</B> In exercising its discretion as to whether to order remission of a forfeited
bond, the trial court may consider whether the defendant has been produced within
a reasonable time after forfeiture, whether the people have lost any
rights against the defendant, whether the defendant's failure to appear
was wilful, and whether a forfeiture will subject the surety to an extreme
hardship. People v. Schliesser, 39 Colo. App. 54, 563 P.2d 377,
rev'd on other grounds sub nom. Owens v. People, 194 Colo. 389, 572
P.2d 837 (1977).</T>
   <P></P>
   <T>
    <B>Such as hardship to surety.</B> When state incurred no expenses and lost no
legal
rights
due to defendant's nonappearance and guarantor of bond was
subjected to extreme hardship due to monthly payments on the
bond, the trial court abused its discretion in denying a
motion for return of the forfeited bond.
Owens v. People, 194 Colo. 389, 572 P.2d 837 (1977).</T>
   <P></P>
   <T>The only factor which the courts of
this state have considered as basis for remission where the principal
disappears is whether the surety will thereby suffer extreme
hardship, such hardships as will cause destitution to a family,
deprive children of support and education, or creditors of
their just debts. People v. Johnson, 155 Colo. 392, 395 P.2d 19 (1964).</T>
   <P></P>
   <T>Where defendant is produced within reasonable time after
forfeiture, remission will be granted to a surety if the
people have not lost any rights as a result of his nonappearance,
especially if his failure to appear was other than deliberate
and wilful. People v. Johnson, 155 Colo. 392, 395 P.2d 19 (1964).</T>
   <P></P>
   <T>Where the accused had not been returned to custody at the time of
the hearing on the motion to remit the bond, and where the guarantor
did not establish that he would suffer extreme hardship as a result
of the forfeiture, the trial court did not abuse its discretion by
denying the motion for reimbursement. People v. Gossett, 680 P.2d
1323 (Colo. App. 1984).</T>
   <P></P>
   <T>
    <B>One of the functions of a bond</B>
is to relieve state of burden of securing appearance in court by
giving bondsman a strong incentive to insure such attendance.
Where person posting bond made money available to the court
and did all that could be expected in attempting to secure
defendant's attendance in court, purposes of bond were served
and state will not be penalized by bond's remittance.
People v. Saviano, 677 P.2d 414 (Colo. App. 1983).</T>
   <P></P>
   <T>
    <B>Setting aside of bond forfeitures not warranted</B> by this section where
the defendant, released on bail after posting of bond, failed to appear
at her hearing because police had told her that she would be arrested on
another charge as soon as the arrest warrant for her was located. People
v. Rothe, 43 Colo. App. 274, 606 P.2d 79 (1979).</T>
   <P></P>
   <T>
    <B>Limitation on reversal of decision not to order remission.</B>
The decision not to order remission of a forfeited bond may be
reversed only if it appears that the trial court has abused its
discretion. People v. Schliesser, 39 Colo. App. 54, 563 P.2d 377,
rev'd on other grounds sub nom. Owens v. People, 194 Colo. 389,

   <P></P>
   <T>
    <B>Determination of "material increase of risk" to bondsman dependent upon
terms of bond agreement.</B> The court must look to the bond agreement to
determine whether a trial court's action in allowing withdrawal of a guilty

materially increases the risk of the bondsman and terminates the bondsman's
surety obligation. Rodriguez v. People, 191 Colo. 540, 554 P.2d 291 (1976);

By entering into a bond, each obligor, whether he or she is the
principal or a surety, submits to the jurisdiction of the court. His or her liability under the
bond may be enforced, without the necessity of an independent action, as follows: The court
shall order the issuance of a citation directed to the obligor to show cause, if any there be,
why judgment should not be entered against him or her forthwith and execution issue
thereon. Said citation may be served personally or by certified mail upon the obligor directed
to the address given in the bond. Hearing on the citation shall be held not less than
twenty-one days after service. The defendant's attorney and the prosecuting attorney shall be
given notice of the hearing. At the conclusion of the hearing, the court may enter a judgment
for the state and against the obligor, and execution shall issue thereon as on other judgments.
The district attorney shall have execution issued forthwith upon the judgment and deliver it
to the sheriff to be executed by levy upon the stocks, bond, or real estate which has been
accepted as security for the bond.</SECTION-TEXT>

    <B>Annotator's note.</B> Since § 16-4-114 is similar to § 16-4-112 as it
existed prior to the 2013 repeal and reenactment of this part 1, relevant cases decided under
that provision have been included in the annotations to this section.</T>
   <P></P>
   <T>
    <B>Subsection (5)(h) authorizes a trial court to order that a bail forfeiture judgment
be set aside upon such conditions as the court may impose, "if it appears that justice so
requires".</B> This standard is essentially an appeal to the conscience of the court. No
clear rule can be set down that will guide the trial court in every instance, because the
court must consider the totality of facts and circumstances in each individual case.

   <P></P>
   <T>Factors the court should consider include: (1) The willfulness of the defendant's
violations of the conditions of bail; (2) the surety's participation in locating or
apprehending the defendant; (3) the cost, inconvenience, and prejudice suffered by the
state resulting from the violation; (4) any intangible costs; (5) the public interest in
ensuring the defendant's appearance; and (6) any other mitigating factors. These factors
encompass the principle that generally only acts of God, of the state, or of law will
relieve a surety from liability. People v. Bustamante-Payan, 856 P.2d 42 (Colo. App.

   <T>In exercising its discretion, a trial court should be mindful of the policies concerning
bail, including the policy that sureties should not be penalized when it appears they are

conviction.</M>
  </CATCH-LINE>
(1)<N></N>(a)<M>After conviction, either before or after sentencing, the defendant may
orally, or in writing, move for release on bail pending determination of a motion for a new
trial or motion in arrest of judgment or during any stay of execution or pending review by an
appellate court, and, except in cases where the defendant has been convicted of a capital
offense, the trial court, in its discretion, may continue the bond given for pretrial release, or
may release the defendant on bond with additional conditions including monetary conditions,
or require bond under one or more of the alternatives set forth in section 16-4-104.</M>

nolo contendere or following conviction unless the written consents of the sureties, if any,
are filed with the court. In the initial bond documents filed with the court, a surety shall
indicate, in writing and at the time of the posting of bond, if the surety consents to the
continuance of the bond through sentencing of the defendant. If the surety does not provide
written consent at the time of the initial posting of bond, the surety may provide written
consent at the time of the plea of guilty or nolo contendere or within a reasonable time
thereafter as determined by the court. A court shall not require the posting of any form of
bond that allows for the continuance of said bond after a plea of guilty or of nolo contendere
or following conviction without filing with the court the written consents of the sureties, if
any.</M>
  </T>
  <P N="(1)(d)"></P>

Appeal", see 48 Colo. Law. 30 (May 2019).</T>
   <P></P>
   <T>
    <B>Annotator's note.</B> Since § 16-4-201 is similar to
repealed § 39-2-19, CRS 53, and laws antecedent to CSA, C. 48, § 443,
relevant cases construing those provisions have been included in the
annotations to this section.</T>
   <P></P>
   <T>
    <B>The court had authority at common law to admit to bail after conviction.</B>
People v. Junes, 77 Colo. 38, 233 P. 1109 (1925).</T>
   <P></P>
   <T>
    <B>The trial court retains jurisdiction to grant or deny an appeal bond even after the
defendant has filed a notice of appeal.</B> The trial court retains jurisdiction to act with
respect to matters which are not relative to or do not affect the order or judgment on
appeal. Since the granting or denial of an appeal bond has no impact or bearing upon the
underlying conviction or related issues pending on appeal, the trial court retains
jurisdiction. People v. Stewart, 26 P.3d 17 (Colo. App. 2000), rev'd on other grounds, 55
P.3d 107 (Colo. 2002).</T>
   <P></P>
   <T>
    <B>Purpose of section.</B> The purpose of § 16-4-106 and this
section is to authorize the court to exercise discretion rather than
follow a fixed policy and to permit a recognizance to remain in
effect, without the necessity of a new bond, after conviction and until
disposition of the case in the trial court. Trujillo v. District Court,
131 Colo. 428, 282 P.2d 703 (1955).</T>

   <P></P>
   <T>
    <B>Power to admit to bail after conviction is discretionary</B>
with the trial court; it is not a matter of right. People v. Junes,
77 Colo. 38, 233 P. 1109 (1925).</T>
   <P></P>
   <T>
    <B>Probationer awaiting adjudication of a petition to revoke probation or a deferred
judgment does not have a right to bond despite the fact that</B> the revocation motions
are based on a new charge for which the probationer is presumed innocent. People v.
Johnson, 2017 COA 97, -- P.3d --.</T>
   <P></P>
   <T>
    <B>Entry of guilty verdict or acceptance of guilty plea
completes conviction.</B> For purposes of the bail bond statute,
a "conviction" occurs and is complete either upon the entry
of a guilty verdict following trial or upon the acceptance
of a plea of guilty, either to the original charge or to a
lesser included charge.
People v. Bartsch, 37 Colo. App. 52, 543 P.2d 1273 (1975).</T>
   <P></P>
   <T>"Conviction" occurs upon entry of a plea of guilty. Rodriguez
v. People, 191 Colo. 540, 554 P.2d 291 (1976).</T>
   <P></P>
   <T>
    <B>The word "conviction" in this section cannot include
sentencing;</B> it must refer to an occurrence before sentence.
People v. Bartsch, 37 Colo. App. 52, 543 P.2d 1273 (1975).</T>
   <P></P>
   <T>
    <B>Misdescription of crime in recognizance, after conviction,
is not fatal.</B> People v. Junes, 77 Colo. 38, 233 P. 1109 (1925).</T>
   <P></P>
   <T>
    <B>Where defendant entered plea of guilty, surety's obligation
under recognizance bond was terminated.</B> Rodriguez v. People, 191 Colo. 540,
554 P.2d 291 (1976).</T>
   <P></P>
   <T>
    <B>And trial court could not continue bond without first obtaining
surety's consent.</B> Rodriguez v. People, 191 Colo. 540, 554 P.2d
291 (1976).</T>
   <P></P>
   <T>Although the trial judge may continue the original bond
to final disposition, he must obtain the consent of the surety to continue
it beyond conviction. Rodriguez v. People, 191 Colo. 540, 554 P.2d 291 (1976).</T>
   <P></P>
   <T>
    <B>This section does not require separate or renewed consent</B>
of sureties at various stages of the proceeding.
O'Neil v. People, 198 Colo. 9, 595 P.2d 235 (1979).</T>
   <P></P>
   <T>
    <B>Statutes relating to bail constitute part of the surety's contract.</B>
People v. Hampton, 662 P.2d 498 (Colo. App. 1983).</T>
   <P></P>
   <T>
    <B>Applicability of pretrial bond to post-trial period.</B>
While the terms of the original pretrial bond may also cover the post-trial period, without
such a
provision, this section is controlling as to
post-trial continuances of a bond. Where the language
and terms of the original bond do not provide the court with the requisite written consent
to
continue liability beyond conviction, oral
statements to the court, after the defendant fails to appear, do not bind the surety.
People v. Hampton, 662 P.2d 498 (Colo. App. 1983).</T>
   <P></P>
   <T>
    <B>Where contract deemed to impose postconviction liability.</B>
By executing bail bond contracts containing language binding
them until the final sentence or order of the court, sureties
are deemed to have given the statutorily required written
consent to continue their liability on the bonds after conviction
and until sentencing.
O'Neil v. People, 198 Colo. 9, 595 P.2d 235 (1979).</T>
   <P></P>
   <T>
    <B>Defendant's tender of signed petition and stipulation constituted a "plea
of guilty"</B> within the meaning of the bond statute, and a formal statement
by the court accepting the guilty plea was not necessary. People v.
Hernandez, 902 P.2d 846 (Colo. App. 1995).</T>
   <P></P>
   <T>
    <B>A conviction is not necessary to exonerate the surety;</B> a plea of guilty
suffices. People v. Hernandez, 902 P.2d 846 (Colo. App. 1995).</T>
   <P></P>
   <T>
    <B>Entry of a guilty plea constitutes an "answer" to the charges</B> and
satisfies the terms of a bond that bound the surety until the defendant
"answered" the charges against him. People v. Hernandez, 902 P.2d 846 (Colo.
App. 1995).</T>
   <P></P>

    <B>Annotator's note.</B> Since § 16-4-204 is similar to repealed §
39-2-17, CRS 53,
relevant cases construing that provision have been included in the annotations
to
this section.</T>
   <P></P>
   <T>
    <B>Pursuant to this section, an appellate court may hear an appeal of an order
entered pursuant to § 16-4-109.</B> In 2013, the provisions of § 16-4-107
were moved with minor changes to § 16-4-109, but a conforming amendment was
not made to this section to include the new § 16-4-109. This created a question of
ambiguity as to whether this section still applies to the subject matter that was originally
in § 16-4-107 but is now contained in § 16-4-109. The ambiguity does not
limit an
appellate court from appeals related to the subject matter of the original § 16-4-107
with respect to the reduction or increase in the amount of bail. People v. Jones, 2015 CO
20, 346 P.3d 44.</T>
   <P></P>
   <T>
    <B>This section authorizes an appeal of a court order modifying a bail bond using
the criteria in § 16-4-105 since the authority for the order is found in §
16-4-109.</B> This section authorizes an appeal of a court order related to
determination, modification, and continuation of bail bonds. Although § 16-4-105
provided the evidentiary basis for changing a defendant's bond, a court's authority to
modify the bond is found in § 16-4-109, which serves as a basis for hearing the
appeal. People v. Jones, 2015 CO 20, 346 P.3d 44.</T>
   <P></P>
   <T>
    <B>Review of excessive bail.</B> Where the bond fixed by the trial court in a
criminal case is so grossly excessive as to amount to a denial of the
right of accused to be admitted to bail in a reasonable amount, the
supreme court will direct that the accused be admitted to bail in
reasonable amount. Altobella v. District Court, 153 Colo. 143, 385
P.2d 663 (1963).</T>
   <P></P>
   <T>If the bail is deemed excessive, relief may be sought by suitable
proceedings, but not through appeal after conviction of the crime charged.
Corbett v. People, 153 Colo. 457, 387 P.2d 409 (1963), cert. denied, 377
U.S. 939, 84 S. Ct. 1346, 12 L. Ed. 2d 302 (1964).</T>
   <P></P>
   <T>
    <B>Review of refusal to admit prisoner to bail.</B> Where a petitioner
is adjudged guilty of contempt of court for refusal to answer questions before
the grand jury and is sentenced to four months in jail, refusal of the trial
court to stay execution or admit the petitioner to bail pending review by the
supreme court is an abuse of discretion. Smaldone v. People, 153 Colo.
208, 385 P.2d 127 (1963).</T>
   <P></P>
   <T>A claim of error that court refused to admit defendant to bail may
be raised by appropriate proceedings, but not by appeal after conviction
of the crime charged. Corbett v. People, 153 Colo. 457, 387 P.2d

(1)<M>If a person who has been charged with crime in another state and released
from custody prior to final judgment, including the final
disposition of any appeal, is alleged to have violated the

state, a designated agent of the court, judge, or magistrate
who authorized the release may request the issuance of a
warrant for the arrest of the person and an order authorizing

(1)<M>A person whose identifying information has been mistakenly associated with an
arrest, summons, summons and complaint, felony complaint, information, indictment, or
conviction is a victim of identity theft for the purposes of this section. A victim of
identify
theft may proceed either through the judicial process in subsection (2) of this section or
the
Colorado bureau of investigation process in subsection (3) of this section.</M>
  <P N="(2)(a)"></P>
  <T>(2)<N></N>(a)<M>If a criminal charge is not pending, a victim of identity theft may,
with notice to the prosecutor, petition the court with jurisdiction over the arrest,
summons,
summons and complaint, felony complaint, information, indictment, or conviction to
judicially determine the person's factual innocence. Alternatively, the court, on its own
motion, may make such a determination in the case. If a criminal charge is pending, the
prosecuting attorney may request the court to make such a determination. A judicial
determination of factual innocence made pursuant to this section may be determined,
with

  <P N="(2)(b)"></P>
  <T>(b)<M>If the court determines that there is no reasonable cause to believe that a
victim of identity theft committed the offense for which the victim's identity has been
mistakenly associated with an arrest, summons, summons and complaint, felony
complaint,
information, indictment, or conviction, the court shall find the victim factually innocent
of
that offense. If the victim is found factually innocent, the court shall issue an order
certifying
this determination.</M>
  </T>
  <P N="(2)(c)"></P>
  <T>(c)<M>After the court has determined that a person is factually innocent, the court
shall provide the Colorado bureau of investigation with the order of factual innocence.
Upon

modify
the victim of identity theft's law enforcement-only and public criminal history record
accordingly.</M>

  <P N="(2)(d)"></P>
  <T>(d)<M>A court that issues a determination of factual innocence pursuant to this
section
may at any time vacate that determination if the petition, or information submitted in
support
of the petition, contains material misrepresentation or fraud. If the court vacates a
determination of factual innocence, the court shall issue an order rescinding any orders
made
pursuant to this subsection (2).</M>

  <T>(2.5)<N></N>(a)<M>A person who has had his or her identity stolen or used that is not
associated with an arrest, summons, summons and complaint, felony complaint,
information,
indictment, or conviction may petition the district court in the county where the person
lives
for an order of factual innocence. A judicial determination of factual innocence made
pursuant to this section may be determined, with or without a hearing, upon declarations,
affidavits, or any other relevant, material, reliable information submitted by the parties
and
records of the court.</M>
  </T>
  <P N="(2.5)(b)"></P>
  <T>(b)<M>If the court finds that the person's identity was stolen or used by another, the
court shall issue an order certifying this determination.</M>

  <T>(c)<M>A court that issues a determination of factual innocence pursuant to this
subsection (2.5) may at any time vacate that determination if the petition, or information
submitted in support of the petition, contains material misrepresentation or fraud. If the
court
vacates a determination of factual innocence, the court shall issue an order rescinding any
orders made pursuant to this subsection (2.5).</M>
  </T>
  <P N="(3)(a)"></P>
  <T>(3)<N></N>(a)<M>A victim of identity theft may contact the Colorado bureau of
investigation and submit a records challenge to one or more criminal charges the victim
of
identity theft is alleged to have committed. The victim of identity theft shall include a
copy
of his or her fingerprints with the records challenge.</M>
  </T>
  <P N="(3)(b)(I)"></P>
  <T>(b)<N></N>(I)<M>A Colorado bureau of investigation fingerprint examiner shall
compare
the submitted fingerprints in the records challenge to the fingerprints obtained in each
criminal case that the victim of identity theft is making a records challenge.</M>
  </T>
  <P N="(3)(b)(II)"></P>
  <T>(II)<M>The fingerprint examiner shall determine either that the fingerprints
submitted
in the records challenge are not the same as the individual arrested or that they are the

as the individual arrested.</M>
  </T>
  <P N="(3)(b)(III)"></P>
  <T>(III)<M>If the fingerprint examiner determines the fingerprints submitted in the
fingerprint challenge are not the same as the individual arrested, the Colorado bureau of
investigation shall issue a letter of misidentification and shall modify the victim of
identity
theft's law enforcement-only and public criminal history record accordingly. The letter of
misidentification shall state the holder of the letter is a victim of identity theft in each
criminal case identified by the letter.</M>
  </T>
  <P N="(4)"></P>
  <T>(4)<M>A person who knows or reasonably suspects that his or her identifying
information has been unlawfully used by another person may initiate a law enforcement
investigation by contacting the local law enforcement agency that has jurisdiction over
the
victim's residence or over the place where a crime was committed. Such agency shall take
a police report of the matter, provide the complainant with a copy of that report, and
begin
an investigation of the facts. If the suspected crime was committed in a different
jurisdiction,
the local law enforcement agency may refer the matter to the local law enforcement
agency
where the suspected crime was committed for investigation of the facts.</M>

Every indictment or accusation of the grand jury shall be
deemed
sufficient technically and correct which states the offense in the terms and language of
the
statute defining it, including either conjunctive or disjunctive clauses, or so plainly that
the
nature of the offense may be easily understood by the jury. Pleading in either the
conjunctive or the disjunctive shall place a defendant on notice that the prosecution may

    <B>It is the province of the general assembly to provide what elements of an
offense must be set forth</B> in an indictment or information.
Edwards v. People, 176 Colo. 478, 491 P.2d 566 (1971).</T>
   <P></P>
   <T>
    <B>Purpose of section.</B> This section and § 16-10-202, dealing with
variance
between allegations and proof, undoubtedly were adopted by the general assembly with
a view of removing from consideration those technical rules of pleading long the bane
of criminal procedure at common law and the occasion of many miscarriages of justice
in antiquated times.
Helser v. People, 100 Colo. 371, 68 P.2d 543 (1937).</T>
   <P></P>
   <T>One purpose of the requirements of this section is to provide sufficient
notice to defendants to permit the preparation of defenses prior to trial.
People v. Thimmes, 643 P.2d 780 (Colo. App. 1981).</T>
   <P></P>
   <T>
    <B>Purposes of criminal indictment by grand jury are twofold:</B>
First, it must give the defendant sufficient notice of the crime that has
allegedly been committed so that a defense may be prepared; second, it must
define the acts which constitute the crime with sufficient definiteness
so that the defendant may plead the resolution of the indictment as a
bar to subsequent proceedings. People v. Tucker,
631 P.2d 162 (Colo. 1981).</T>
   <P></P>
   <T>
    <B>This section does not encourage subtleties and hypertechnical refinements</B>
in criminal cases.
Sweek v. People, 85 Colo. 479, 277 P. 1 (1929).</T>
   <P></P>
   <T>
    <B>An information or indictment charging offense in language of the statute
is sufficient.</B>
Schneider v. People, 30 Colo. 493, 71 P. 369 (1903);
Knepper v. People, 63 Colo. 396, 167 P. 779 (1917);

People v. Maestas, 199 Colo. 143, 606 P.2d 849 (1980).</T>
   <P></P>
   <T>An indictment or information is sufficient which describes an offense either
in the language of the statute or so plainly that the nature of the crime may be
readily and easily understood by a jury.
Albert v. People, 90 Colo. 219, 7 P.2d 822 (1932).</T>
   <P></P>
   <T>A charge so worded that it is "sufficient technically and correct", sufficiently
sets forth the substance of the offense. If an indictment is correct when it charges
in the words of the statute, then it must contain the substance of the offense.
Papas v. People, 98 Colo. 306, 55 P.2d 1330 (1936).</T>

    <B>It must be so charged that it may be readily understood by accused and
jury.</B>

   <P></P>
   <T>
    <B>But it need not furnish such detail as to bar further prosecution.</B> An
indictment or information need not plead an offense in such detail as to be
self-sufficient as a bar to further prosecution for the same offense for the
judgment constitutes the bar.
Howe v. People, 178 Colo. 248, 496 P.2d 1040 (1972).</T>
   <P></P>
   <T>
    <B>The ultimate test of the sufficiency of an indictment</B>
is whether it is sufficiently definite to inform the defendant
of the charges against him so as to enable him to prepare a
defense and to plead the judgment in bar of any further
prosecutions for the same offense.
People v. Westendorf, 37 Colo. App. 111, 542 P.2d 1300 (1975);
People v. Donachy, 196 Colo. 289, 586 P.2d 14 (1978).</T>
   <P></P>
   <T>An indictment must be definite enough to give defendant sufficient notice
of the crime alleged to prepare a defense. People v. Gable, 647 P.2d 246
(Colo. App. 1982).</T>
   <P></P>
   <T>
    <B>Right to be informed of nature of charges.</B>
It is a defendant's right to be informed with reasonable certainty
of the nature of the charges against him by requiring that an
indictment answer the questions of "who, what, where and how"
in cases where the acts constituting the offense are not
adequately described by the statute.
People v. Donachy, 196 Colo. 289, 586 P.2d 14 (1978).</T>
   <P></P>
   <T>
    <B>Exceptions to general rule.</B> If, as is not uncommon, the court by
construction
restricts a statute to a narrower application than its general words would indicate,
an indictment on it in the statutory words will be ill; it must follow the court's
narrower construction.
Schneider v. People, 30 Colo. 493, 71 P. 369 (1903).</T>
   <P></P>
   <T>If the statute does not sufficiently set out the facts which constitute the
offense so that the defendant may have notice of what he is charged, or if the
words of the statute by their generality embrace cases which fall within the terms
but not within the spirit or meaning of the statute, then a more particular statement
of facts is necessary, and the specific facts to bring the defendant precisely
within the inhibition of the law must be alleged.
Schneider v. People, 30 Colo. 493, 71 P. 369 (1903);
Knepper v. People, 63 Colo. 396, 167 P. 779 (1917);
Balfe v. People, 66 Colo. 94, 179 P. 137 (1919).</T>
   <P></P>
   <T>Where the acts constituting the offense are not described by the statute,
an indictment merely reciting the statutory words is insufficient.
People v. Xericos, 186 Colo. 21, 525 P.2d 415 (1974).</T>
   <P></P>
   <T>
    <B>Bill of particulars not part of indictment.</B> Although
the purpose of a bill of particulars is to define more
specifically the offense charged, a bill of particulars
is not a part of an indictment nor an amendment thereto.
It cannot in any way aid an indictment fundamentally bad.
People v. Westendorf, 37 Colo. App. 111, 542 P.2d 1300 (1975).</T>
   <P></P>
   <T>
    <B>Defendant is not legally charged by ineffective indictment.</B> Where
indictment
is ineffective because it charges petitioner with offense alleged to have occurred at
time subsequent to filing of indictment, defendant is not legally charged or subject
to jurisdiction of court as to that transaction until reindicted.
Rowse v. District Court, 180 Colo. 44, 502 P.2d 422 (1972).</T>
   <P></P>
   <T>An insufficient indictment does not legally charge a
crime or subject defendant to the jurisdiction of the court.
People v. Westendorf, 37 Colo. App. 111, 542 P.2d 1300 (1975).</T>
   <P></P>
   <T>
    <B>And omission of essential ingredient of offense may be taken advantage of at
any stage.</B> If any essential ingredient of an offense is omitted, advantage thereof
may be taken, at any stage of the proceedings, even after sentence has been pronounced.
Iwerks v. People, 88 Colo. 578, 298 P. 644 (1931).</T>
   <P></P>
   <T>
    <B>Defective indictment may be asserted on appeal.</B> Although
defendant did not raise the insufficiency of the indictment
at trial or in his motion for new trial, he is not thereby
precluded from asserting that defect now on appeal.
People v. Westendorf, 37 Colo. App. 111, 542 P.2d 1300 (1975).</T>
   <P></P>
   <T>
    <B>But technicalities not affecting substantial rights will not be considered on
review.</B>
Updike v. People, 92 Colo. 125, 18 P.2d 472 (1933);
Helser v. People, 100 Colo. 371, 68 P.2d 543 (1937).</T>
   <P></P>
   <T>
    <B>Charging an impossible date as time of occurrence of alleged offense is matter
of substance, not form,</B> and attempt to indict a person for an offense alleged to
have occurred subsequent to filing of indictment is a nullity.
Rowse v. District Court, 180 Colo. 44, 502 P.2d 422 (1972).</T>
   <P></P>
   <T>
    <B>Jeopardy does not attach by indictment defective in substance.</B>
An indictment which is defective in substance merely prevents prosecution on the basis
of
that
particular pleading. No jeopardy attaches, and
the defendant may be charged by any appropriate and
sufficient pleading. People v. Thimmes, 643 P.2d 780 (Colo. App. 1981).</T>
   <P></P>
   <T>
    <B>Date of offense is material allegation.</B>
Allegations specifying the date on which an accused allegedly committed an offense are
always
material when the offense charged is one which may
be barred by an applicable statute of limitations.
People v. Thimmes, 643 P.2d 780 (Colo. App. 1981).</T>
   <P></P>
   <T>
    <B>Value need not be alleged if not essential.</B> Where the value is not
essential to the punishment, as in indictments for robbery, it need not be
distinctly alleged or proved.
Rowan v. People, 93 Colo. 473, 26 P.2d 1066 (1933).</T>

  <AN-DIV>II. ILLUSTRATIVE CASES.</AN-DIV>
  <ANNO-TEXT>
   <T>
    <B>Assault with intent to rob.</B> An indictment for assault with intent to rob
which alleges, as to the assault, that the defendant "did make an assault", without
stating all of the particulars comprehended by the statutory definition of that
term is sufficient.
McNamara v. People, 24 Colo. 61, 48 P. 541 (1897).</T>
   <P></P>
   <T>
    <B>Conspiracy.</B> In an indictment for conspiracy, unless the crime which it
is alleged defendants conspired to commit is named, the indictment must allege
facts constituting every element necessary to establish that offense as fully as if
the indictment was for its perpetration.
Imboden v. People, 40 Colo. 142, 90 P. 608 (1907).</T>
   <P></P>
   <T>An indictment for conspiracy need not aver the means by which the
conspiracy was to be carried out.
Imboden v. People, 40 Colo. 142, 90 P. 608 (1907).</T>
   <P></P>
   <T>Because of the veil of secrecy surrounding most conspiracies, considerable
latitude is allowed in drafting a conspiracy indictment. People v. Gable,
647 P.2d 246 (Colo. App. 1982).</T>
   <P></P>
   <T>
    <B>Forgery.</B> An indictment drawn upon the section relating to forgery is
framed
in
the language of the act, and hence it was not essential to use the words "falsely make"
or to set out the instrument.
Cohen v. People, 7 Colo. 274, 3 P. 385 (1883).</T>
   <P></P>
   <T>
    <B>Murder.</B> In an indictment for murder it is not necessary to state more
than the statute provides in order to sustain a conviction of murder in the first
degree.

   <P></P>
   <T>An indictment which simply charged that the defendant murdered
the victim was upheld as constitutional.

   <P></P>
   <T>
    <B>Perjury.</B> A perjury indictment which does not set
forth the alleged false statements, either verbatim or in
substance, is insufficient to charge the crime.
People v. Westendorf, 37 Colo. App. 111, 542 P.2d 1300 (1975).</T>
   <P></P>
   <T>A perjury indictment which tracks the language of § 18-8-502(1) and
included a verbatim partial transcript of the defendant's grand jury testimony
which was asserted to be materially false, together with the additional
averment that the defendant did not believe the testimony to be true, is
sufficient to advise the defendant of the charges against him. People v.

   <P></P>
   <T>
    <B>Annotator's note.</B> Since § 16-5-202 is similar to repealed §
39-4-4,
C.R.S. 1963, § 39-4-4, CRS 53, CSA, C. 48, § 457, and laws antecedent
thereto,
relevant cases construing those provisions have been included in the annotations
to this section.</T>
   <P></P>
   <T>
    <B>Purpose of section.</B> The requirement of the signature on the information is
for the protection of the defendant as a guarantee that the prosecution is being
conducted in good faith.
Harris v. Municipal Court, 123 Colo. 539, 234 P.2d 1055 (1951).</T>
   <P></P>
   <T>
    <B>General effect of section.</B> This section means what it says and applies it
to all informations except where in so doing it fails to give the defendant the
nature and cause of the accusation as required by the constitution.
Highley v. People, 65 Colo. 497, 177 P. 975 (1918).</T>
   <P></P>
   <T>
    <B>This section is not in conflict with the bill of rights</B> provision that
in criminal prosecutions the accused shall have the right to demand the nature
and cause of the accusation.
Jordan v. People, 19 Colo. 417, 36 P. 218 (1894).</T>
   <P></P>
   <T>
    <B>Attorney general has same powers as district attorney.</B> The attorney
general may subscribe, present, and prosecute an information against a public
offender with the same powers as the district attorney of the proper district.
People v. Gibson, 53 Colo. 231, 125 P. 531 (1912).</T>
   <P></P>
   <T>
    <B>Signature by deputy is proper.</B> Signature of the prosecuting officer,
typewritten, but followed by the name of his deputy, written with his own hand,
is a compliance with this section.
Almond v. People, 55 Colo. 425, 135 P. 783 (1913).</T>
   <P></P>
   <T>
    <B>Additions to special prosecutor's name in information are treated as
surplusage.</B>
Where the district attorney is disqualified from prosecuting a case and the court
appoints a special prosecutor, the prosecutor so appointed is authorized to sign an
information in the case in his own name, and the fact that he placed before his name
the name of the district attorney and added to his own signature the words "special
deputy" neither added to, nor detracted from, the proper authentication in his own name.
The additions are treated as surplusage.
Williams v. People, 26 Colo. 272, 57 P. 701 (1899).</T>
   <P></P>
   <T>
    <B>Failure to sign information is not jurisdictional,</B> but should be pointed out
so that the trial court might direct the parties to comply with the statute.
Harris v. Municipal Court, 123 Colo. 539, 234 P.2d 1055 (1951).</T>
   <P></P>
   <T>
    <B>Phrase "against the peace and dignity" of people.</B> An information
concluding
"against the peace and dignity of the same people of the state of Colorado", is in
substantial conformity with the requirement of the constitution that all prosecutions
shall be carried on in the name and by the authority of the people of the state of
Colorado, and conclude against the peace and dignity of the same.
Holt v. People, 23 Colo. 1, 45 P. 374 (1896).</T>
   <P></P>
   <T>The omission from a criminal information
of the
concluding phrase "and against the peace and dignity of the same" goes to matter
of form, and in no degree impairs the jurisdiction of the court.
Chemgas v. Tynan, 51 Colo. 35, 116 P. 1045 (1911);
People v. Hunter, 666 P.2d 570 (Colo. 1983).</T>
   <P></P>
   <T>
    <B>Use of words "feloniously" and "unlawfully".</B> Appellant complains that the
information does not charge that the accused knowingly and wilfully committed the
offense. Since the information charges the act as "unlawfully and feloniously" done,
the objection does not affect the real merits.
McConnell v. People, 73 Colo. 99, 213 P. 674 (1923).</T>
   <P></P>
   <T>The use of both the words "unlawfully" and "feloniously" in the statute does
not require that the former must appear in indictment or information if the latter does.
Bridge v. People, 63 Colo. 319, 165 P. 778 (1917).</T>
   <P></P>
   <T>
    <B>Separate infractions of same law should be distinguished.</B> In every
information
or indictment charging a criminal offense, good pleading required that sufficient facts
be set forth to identify the crime from another infraction of the same law by the same
defendant. This would seem essential in order to safeguard the accused against a second
prosecution for the same offense, as well as to acquaint him with what he must meet on
trial.
Bustamante v. People, 136 Colo. 362, 317 P.2d 885 (1957).</T>
   <P></P>
   <T>
    <B>No substitution for section identified as subject of prosecution.</B> Where a
count
of an information in a criminal case identifies with particularity the exact section of
the statute upon which a prosecution is based, no other statute can be substituted for the
one actually selected as forming the subject matter of the prosecution.
Skidmore v. People, 154 Colo. 363, 390 P.2d 944 (1964).</T>
   <P></P>
   <T>
    <B>Amendment of minor irregularities only permitted.</B> Generally, a criminal
complaint or affidavit may be amended so as to correct minor irregularities or defects
but major defects such as a material misnomer of accused or an omission of essential
allegations cannot be cured by amendment on the examination.
Bustamante v. People, 136 Colo. 362, 317 P.2d 885 (1957).</T>
   <P></P>
   <T>
    <B>Any conviction based on an information requiring major amendment is
void,</B>
for the court is without jurisdiction.
Bustamante v. People, 136 Colo. 362, 317 P.2d 885 (1957).</T>
   <P></P>
   <T>
    <B>When information fails to charge crime, court acquires no jurisdiction.</B>
People v. Moore, 200 Colo. 481, 615 P.2d 726 (1980).</T>
   <P></P>
   <T>
    <B>Objections to form of information must be made before
trial or they are waived.</B>

People v. Joseph, 920 P.2d 850 (Colo. App. 1995);
People v. Russell, 36 P.3d 92 (Colo. App. 2001).</T>
   <P></P>
   <T>
    <B>Authority of district attorney is a technical matter subject to waiver.</B>
Just as a
defendant may waive objections to venue, he or she may also waive any objection
to the authority of the district attorney to bring a criminal charge. People
v. Joseph, 920 P.2d 850 (Colo. App. 1995).</T>
   <P></P>
   <T>
    <B>Even if defendant did not waive objection</B> to the form of the information,
defendant must demonstrate how any errors prejudiced him in order for a defect in the
form to dictate reversal of a conviction. People v. Russell, 36 P.3d 92 (Colo. App.
2001).</T>

    <B>Indictment must clearly state essential facts and
answer questions of who, what, where, and how.</B>
People v. Tucker, 631 P.2d 162 (Colo. 1981).</T>
   <P></P>
   <T>
    <B>Time when offense committed.</B>
The general rule is that, where time is not a material element of the offense, the precise
time
at
which the crime is charged to have been
committed is not material. Kogan v. People, 756 P.2d 945 (Colo. 1988).</T>
   <P></P>
   <T>If, however, information about the time is necessary to enable the defendant to
prepare
his
defense or to guard against a subsequent
prosecution for the same crime, such information must be provided. Kogan v. People,
756
P.2d
945 (Colo. 1988).</T>
   <P></P>
   <T>
    <B>Standard of review for bill of particulars</B>
is whether the bill of particulars as produced sufficiently informs the defendant of the
particular
charges at issue so that he is given a fair
opportunity to properly prepare his defense. Kogan v. People, 756 P.2d 945 (Colo.
1988).</T>
   <P></P>
   <T>
    <B>Bill of particulars held insufficient.</B>
Bill of particulars which alleged that certain acts had been committed sometime during a
nine-month period and the absence of any accompanying
detail describing the defendant's alleged acts resulted in clear prejudice to the
defendant. Kogan v. People, 756 P.2d
945 (Colo. 1988).</T>
   <P></P>
   <T>
    <B>It must advise defendant of charge.</B> An information is sufficient if it
advises the defendant of the charge he is facing so that he can adequately defend
himself and be protected from another prosecution for the same offense.

Edwards v. People, 176 Colo. 478, 491 P.2d 566 (1971).</T>
   <P></P>
   <T>An information is sufficient if it informs the defendant of the charges against him so
as
to enable him to prepare a defense and plead the judgment in bar of any further
prosecutions
for the same offense. People v. Flanders, 183 Colo. 268, 516 P.2d 418 (1973);

   <T>
    <B>And must set forth essential elements of crime.</B> An information is
sufficient to apprise a defendant of the charge he faces if it sets forth
the essential elements charging the crime.

   <P></P>
   <T>
    <B>Or in language of statute defining offense.</B> The allegations of an
information
which follow the language of the statute defining the offense are sufficient to satisfy
constitutional requirements, and the offense charged is set forth with such degree of
certainty that the court could lawfully pronounce judgment upon conviction.
Lewis v. People, 109 Colo. 89, 123 P.2d 398 (1942).</T>
   <P></P>
   <T>An information is sufficient if the charge is in the

   <P></P>
   <T>An information is sufficient if the charge is in the language of the statute,

People v. Russell, 36 P.3d 92 (Colo. App. 2001).</T>
   <P></P>
   <T>
    <B>Or with certainty that will support judgment.</B> Statement of offense in the
information is sufficient when set forth with such degree of certainty that the
court may pronounce judgment upon a conviction according to the right of the case.
Compton v. People, 84 Colo. 106, 268 P. 577 (1928).</T>
   <P></P>
   <T>
    <B>But information need not furnish such detail as to bar further prosecution.</B>
An indictment or information need not plead an offense in such detail as to be
self-sufficient as a bar to further prosecution for the same offense, for the
judgment constitutes the bar.
Howe v. People, 178 Colo. 248, 496 P.2d 1040 (1972).</T>
   <P></P>
   <T>
    <B>Information need not include every element of the offense that must be proved
at trial.</B> Information charging possession of marijuana that failed to include
"knowing" possession nevertheless provided sufficient notice to defendant for trial
preparation and was adequate to bar further prosecution for the same offense. People v.

    <B>Incorrect statutory reference not fatal.</B>
The incorrect citation of a specific statutory reference in an information

   <P></P>
   <T>
    <B>Failure of charges to identify the particular statement or assertion alleged to be
false is not a fatal defect.</B> Information was sufficient to allow defendant to prepare a
defense, defendant did not object to the charges or request a bill of particulars, and
defendant did not demonstrate or even allege prejudice. People v. Vigil, 251 P.3d 442
(Colo.

   <P></P>
   <T>
    <B>Technical defects in information do not support reversal.</B> The supreme
court,
in accordance with the spirit and intent of this section, has consistently refused to

every essential element demanded by the Colorado statutes and by generally approved
principles of criminal pleading, apprised the defendant of the nature of the charge, the

malice
aforethought, but failed to pinpoint the allegation that the homicide occurred incident

names.</M>
  </CATCH-LINE>
Whether a prosecution is commenced by indictment,
information, or felony complaint, the district attorney shall make available to the defendant
not later than twenty-one days after the defendant's first appearance at the time of or
following the filing of charges a written list of the names and addresses of the witnesses then
known to the district attorney whom he or she intends to call upon at trial. The district
attorney shall also furnish the defendant in writing prior to trial the names and addresses of
any additional witnesses who have become known to him or her prior to trial and whom he
or she intends to call upon at trial, but this shall not preclude the calling of witnesses whose
names or the materiality of whose testimony are first learned by the district attorney upon the
trial. However, the court may, in its discretion, enter an order that denies the disclosure to the
defendant of the names and addresses of witnesses, or that requires the defense counsel not
to disclose such information to the defendant, subject to rule 16 part I (d)(2) and part III (d)
of the Colorado rules of criminal procedure. The names and addresses of witnesses who are
the subject of the order may be withheld pending a ruling of the court, but the prosecution
shall notify the defense counsel in writing that a motion to withhold witness information has
been filed and that such information will be withheld pending the court's order. Where the
defendant has not had or waived a preliminary hearing, there shall be filed with the
information the affidavit of some credible person verifying the information upon the personal
knowledge of the affiant that the offense was committed.</SECTION-TEXT>

refusal was without just cause, hold the witness in contempt and order
the witness to be confined. Such confinement shall continue until such
time as the witness is willing to give such testimony or provide such
information; however, the court may release the witness from confinement
if the court determines that further confinement will not cause the
witness to give such testimony or provide such information. No period

    <B>Order suppressing intercepted communications is "just cause".</B>
An order suppressing intercepted communications pursuant to § 16-15-102

   <T>
    <B>Attorney may not represent more than one witness.</B>
To preserve the secrecy and effectiveness of the grand jury process,
no attorney who provides counsel in the grand jury room may represent
more than one witness in a single investigation without grand jury
permission, and this is a constitutionally permissible limitation
of the right to counsel.

   <P></P>
   <T>
    <B>Legislative intent as to right to counsel.</B>
Close scrutiny of this section reveals that the general assembly
intended to abolish the established practice of permitting grand
jury witnesses to consult with an attorney outside the grand
jury room only, and substitute a system which expands the
protections afforded grand jury witnesses while insuring
continued efficacy of the grand jury process.

   <P></P>
   <T>
    <B>Oral advisement of rights in presence of grand jury does not meet requirements
of this section</B> and does not afford the witness the protection intended
by this section that he be permitted to exercise his privilege against self-incrimination
outside the presence of the grand jury without having to appear and do so
in the presence of the grand jury. People ex rel. Gallagher v. District

   <P></P>
   <T>
    <B>Inappropriate conduct by district attorney merits court's release of
grand jury transcripts to defense.</B> Only in case where clear examples
of inappropriate conduct by the district attorney may affect the validity
of the defendant's indictment, or the determination of probable cause, should
the trial court sacrifice the confidentiality of the grand jury proceedings
and release a transcript of the grand jury colloquy to defense counsel.
People v. District Court, 199 Colo. 398, 610 P.2d 490 (1980).</T>
   <P></P>
   <T>
    <B>Indictment is culmination of probable cause screening process of grand
jury</B> and that procedure functions as a constitutionally adequate substitute
for a preliminary hearing. People v. District Court, 199 Colo. 398, 610
P.2d 490 (1980).</T>
   <P></P>
   <T>
    <B>When indictment properly dismissed.</B>
Where trial judge, with probable cause as the criteria for determining the
sufficiency of the record to support the indictment, concluded that the
record was insufficient to support the charges contained in the indictment,
the indictment was
properly dismissed. People v. Laughlin, 621 P.2d 1388 (Colo. 1981).</T>
   <P></P>
   <T>
    <B>Court to evaluate finding of probable cause.</B>
The duty of the trial court under subsection (4)(k) is to evaluate the sufficiency
of the evidence presented to the grand jury to establish probable cause.
People v. Luttrell, 636 P.2d 712 (Colo. 1981).</T>
   <P></P>
   <T>
    <B>Standards for review of determination of probable cause.</B>
The district court function in conducting a review of the
grand jury record, as authorized by subsection (4)(k), is much
like the role of the court at a preliminary hearing and the same
rule applies in determining the existence or absence of
probable cause.
The court must draw all inferences in favor of the prosecution,
and when there is a conflict in the testimony a question of
fact exists for determination at trial.
People v. Summers, 197 Colo. 445, 593 P.2d 969 (1979);
People v. Luttrell, 636 P.2d 712 (Colo. 1981).</T>
   <P></P>
   <T>
    <B>Subsection (4)(k) unambiguously requires a district court to dismiss "any
indictment" from a grand jury that lacks probable cause,</B> including an indictment
count that is a sentence enhancer. A proceeding under this section is different from a
preliminary hearing in which the court's authority is limited to dismissing "an offense"
that lacks probable cause. People v. Soto-Campos, 2018 COA 118, 436 P.3d 566.</T>
   <P></P>
   <T>
    <B>In determining whether compliance with subpoena duces tecum will be
"unreasonable
or oppressive",</B>
the court must balance the competing interests of the individual's
right to keep his personal affairs confidential with the grand
jury's right to investigate criminal activity.
Losavio v. Robb, 195 Colo. 533, 579 P.2d 1152 (1978).</T>
   <P></P>
   <T>
    <B>When evidentiary phase of contempt hearing may be closed to public.</B>
The evidentiary phase of a grand jury witness's contempt hearing may be
closed to the public and press only upon express findings by the court that:
(1) A public hearing would create a clear and present danger to the investigation
of matters presently pending before the grand jury; and (2) the prejudicial
effect of such information on presently pending grand jury matters cannot
be avoided by any reasonable alternative less drastic than closure. In
re P.R. v. District Court, 637 P.2d 346 (Colo. 1981).</T>

   <P></P>
   <T>
    <B>Grand jury subpoenas not bona fide where obtained
by unauthorized persons.</B>
Subpoenas for toll records of a telephone subscriber were not
bona fide grand jury subpoenas where they were obtained by
investigators of strike force who had no authority to
represent the state grand jury, and therefore toll records
so obtained were properly suppressed.
People v. Corr, 682 P.2d 20 (Colo.), cert. denied, 469 U.S. 855, 105 S. Ct. 181, 83 L. Ed.
2d 115 (1984).</T>
   <P></P>

    <B>Disclosure of grand jury materials to federal prosecutors without prior
court approval,</B> in violation of this section, did not violate federal
constitutional or statutory rights. United States v. Pignatiello, 628 F.
Supp. 68 (D. Colo. 1986).</T>
   <P></P>
   <T>
    <B>A writ to transport an inmate to a grand jury hearing</B> is not the functional
equivalent of a subpoena to testify at the hearing. As such, an advisement of rights under
subsection (4) is not required. People v. Seader, 2012 COA 184, 292 P.3d 1193.</T>
   <P></P>
   <T>
    <B>Written advisement requirement of subsection (4) does not
apply to non-subpoenaed, voluntary witnesses.</B> People v. Bergen, 883
P.2d 532 (Colo. App. 1994).</T>
   <P></P>
   <T>Term "any witness", as used in subsection (4)(b), means any
subpoenaed witness who did not receive a written advisement upon the
subpoena. It does not include a voluntary witness. People v.
Bergen, 883 P.2d 532 (Colo. App. 1994).</T>
   <P></P>
   <T>The right to service of a subpoena bearing an advance written
advisement is a statutory right subject to voluntary waiver. People

   <P></P>
   <T>
    <B>Violation of procedures may warrant dismissal of indictment</B> if
behavior of government agents is so outrageous as to violate
fundamental fairness and shock the universal sense of justice.
People v. Auld, 815 P.2d 956 (Colo. App. 1991); People v. Bergen,
883 P.2d 532 (Colo. App. 1994).</T>
   <P></P>
   <T>
    <B>Alleged prosecutorial misconduct held not sufficient to
warrant dismissal</B> where evidence against defendant was strong,
unauthorized changes to transcript after return of indictment were
minor, and review of records and affidavits supported trial court's
determination that grand jury discharged its duty without malice,
ill will, fear, or favoritism. People v. Bergen, 883 P.2d 532
(Colo. App. 1994).</T>
   <P></P>
   <T>
    <B>No right to evidentiary hearing on issue of off-the-record
prosecutorial misconduct</B> where evidence presented during recorded
proceedings was more than sufficient to support the indictment.
Although grand jury secrecy is not absolute, breach of that security
should be countenanced only upon compelling need. People v. Bergen,

The judge of a court having jurisdiction of the alleged

prosecuting attorney to prosecute was arbitrary or capricious and without reasonable excuse,
the judge may order the prosecuting attorney to file an information and prosecute the case
or may appoint a special prosecutor to do so. The judge shall appoint the special prosecutor
from among the full-time district attorneys, assistant district attorneys, or deputy district
attorneys who serve in judicial districts other than where the appointment is made; except

   <P></P>
   <T>
    <B>The scope of appellate court review under this section is a mixed question of
law and fact.</B> A district court's factual findings resulting from an evidentiary
hearing may only be disturbed if clearly erroneous and not supported by the record.
However, the district court's application of the statutory standard may be reviewed de
novo. J.S. v. Chambers, 226 P.3d 1193 (Colo. App. 2009).</T>

    <B>Evidence necessary for judge to substitute judgment.</B>
A district judge should not, in the absence of clear
and convincing evidence that the terms of this section have
been met, substitute his judgment or discretion for that of
the prosecutor in a criminal case. Tooley v. District
Court, 190 Colo. 468, 549 P.2d 772 (1976).</T>
   <P></P>
   <T>The district attorney's decision not to prosecute a case may not be challenged unless

Sandoval v. Farish, 675 P.2d 300 (Colo. 1984).</T>
   <P></P>
   <T>District attorney's decision not to prosecute a woman for alleged theft by
deception was not proved to be arbitrary or capricious and without reasonable
excuse, and therefore the judge could not
substitute his judgment or discretion for that of the prosecutor.
Landis v. Farish, 674 P.2d 957 (Colo. 1984).</T>
   <P></P>
   <T>
    <B>There must be a clear and convincing showing that the prosecutor's decision not
to prosecute was arbitrary and capricious and without reasonable excuse before the court
will order prosecution or the appointment of a special prosecutor.</B> The court's
finding that there were credibility issues with the alleged victim's claims, the lack of
specificity regarding the where and when the events occurred, and the passage of time
show the court's decision was not arbitrary and capricious. Kailey v. Chambers, 261 P.3d
792 (Colo. App. 2011).</T>
   <P></P>
   <T>
    <B>The first step for a court to consider is whether a prosecuting attorney has made
a decision not to prosecute.</B> This section requires a refusal to prosecute for the
inquiry to continue. Kailey v. Chambers, 261 P.3d 792 (Colo. App. 2011).</T>
   <P></P>
   <T>
    <B>Challenging party has the burden of proof and even a strong showing does
not shift the burden of proof to the prosecutor.</B> Moody v. Larsen, 802 P.2d
1169 (Colo. App. 1990); J.S. v. Chambers, 226 P.3d 1193 (Colo. App. 2009).</T>
   <P></P>
   <T>This section provides for a prosecutor's appearance at a court-ordered hearing to
"explain the refusal" to prosecute. The statute does not require the prosecutor to present
evidence. J.S. v. Chambers, 226 P.3d 1193 (Colo. App. 2009).</T>
   <P></P>
   <T>
    <B>This section calls for the usual type of hearing</B> in which both parties
are given the opportunity to present evidence and argument. Moody v. Larsen,
802 P.2d 1169 (Colo. App. 1990).</T>
   <P></P>
   <T>
    <B>Each party has the right to present rebuttal evidence</B> to the testimony
of a witness concerning a material issue, including the right to call
witnesses for such purpose. Moody v. Larsen, 802 P.2d 1169 (Colo. App.
1990).</T>
   <P></P>
   <T>
    <B>Actions brought under this section are special statutory proceedings not
exempted from application of the rules of civil procedure</B> because this
section lacks an adequate, exclusive, full, and complete procedure. To hold
otherwise is to render the legislature's mechanism for prevention of
prosecutorial abuses a hollow shell and is not consonant with sound judicial
administration. Trial court
thus erred in denying challenging party's requests for discovery and a
continuance to permit discovery and in failing to exercise its discretion
concerning whether to allow discovery. Moody v. Larsen, 802 P.2d 1169
(Colo. App. 1990).</T>
   <P></P>
   <T>
    <B>The amendment to this section in 2000 effectively eliminated the right to formal
discovery and the right to a full evidentiary hearing.</B> Consequently, the trial court
may, at its discretion, provide for an evidentiary hearing after it has considered the
petitioner's affidavit, the explanation of the district attorney, if required by the court, and
any argument of the parties. Schupper v. Smith, 128 P.3d 323 (Colo. App. 2005).</T>
   <P></P>
   <T>
    <B>The 2000 amendment also established that this section creates a special statutory
proceeding that is exempted from application of the rules of civil procedure.</B>
Schupper v. Smith, 128 P.3d 323 (Colo. App. 2005).</T>
   <P></P>
   <T>
    <B>This section does not require the court to require the prosecuting attorney to
appear before the court and explain the refusal to prosecute.</B> Kailey v. Chambers,
261 P.3d 792 (Colo. App. 2011).</T>
   <P></P>
   <T>
    <B>This section contemplates that the prosecuting attorney may appear in person
before the court and explain the refusal to prosecute.</B> Schupper v. Smith, 128 P.3d
323 (Colo. App. 2005).</T>
   <P></P>
   <T>
    <B>Under this section, the "prosecuting attorney" is the only individual who may be
ordered to prosecute a case;</B> therefore, dismissal of assistant attorneys from
proceeding brought under this section is proper. Schupper v. Smith, 128 P.3d 323 (Colo.
App. 2005).</T>
   <P></P>
   <T>
    <B>District attorney's explanation for declining to prosecute</B> identified reasons
that were supported by some competent evidence and were proper factors under
Sandoval v. Farish, 675 P.2d 300 (Colo. 1984).
The district attorney's analysis of factors
in support of declining prosecution were not so overwhelmed by factors that favor
prosecution as to compel the conclusion that the district attorney's exercise of broad
discretion was arbitrary and capricious. J.S. v. Chambers, 226 P.3d 1193 (Colo. App.
2009).</T>

felony by direct information or felony complaint has the right to demand and receive a
preliminary hearing within a reasonable time to determine whether probable cause exists
to
believe that the offense charged in the information or felony complaint was committed by
the
defendant. In addition, only those persons accused of a class 4, 5, or 6 felony by direct
information or felony complaint which felony requires mandatory sentencing or is a
crime
of violence as defined in section 18-1.3-406, C.R.S., or is a sexual offense under part 4
of
article 3 of title 18, C.R.S., shall have the right to demand and receive a preliminary

within a reasonable time to determine whether probable cause exists to believe that the
offense charged in the information or felony complaint was committed by the defendant.
The
procedure to be followed in asserting the right to a preliminary hearing and the time
within
which demand therefor must be made, as well as the time within which the hearing, if
demanded, shall be had, shall be as provided by applicable rule of the supreme court of
Colorado. A failure to observe and substantially comply with such rule shall be deemed a

C.R.S., or which are sexual offenses under part 4 of article 3 of title 18, C.R.S., shall

reasonable time pursuant to paragraph (a) of this subsection (1), if the defendant is in
custody
for the offense for which the preliminary hearing is requested; except that, upon motion
of
either party, the court shall vacate the preliminary hearing if there is a reasonable
showing
that the defendant has been released from custody prior to the preliminary hearing.</M>

making a ruling for exclusion, the court shall:</M>
  </T>
  <P N="(2)(a)"></P>
  <T>(a)<M>Set forth sufficient findings of fact and conclusions of law to
support the order; and</M>

    <B>The preliminary hearing is a screening device</B> to determine whether
probable cause exists. People v. Weaver, 182 Colo. 221,
511 P.2d 908 (1973).</T>
   <P></P>
   <T>A preliminary hearing is a screening device and does not require
that the prosecution lay out for inspection and for full examination all
witnesses and evidence. People v. Quinn, 183 Colo. 245,

   <T>The preliminary hearing was created as a screening device to afford the
defendant an opportunity to challenge the sufficiency of the
prosecution's evidence to establish probable cause before an impartial
judge. People ex rel. Farina v. District Court, 184 Colo. 406,
521 P.2d 778 (1974).</T>
   <P></P>

    <B>Because the preliminary hearing is a screening device, much latitude is
accorded the prosecution</B> at this stage, and the trial court is obligated to
view the evidence presented in the light most favorable to the prosecution.

   <P></P>
   <T>
    <B>Trial court did not have the authority to dismiss defendant's felony charge on the
basis that defendant had not received a timely preliminary hearing.</B> Because
defendant was not in the custody of the county charging him with the felony, he was not
legally entitled to a preliminary hearing. People v. Pena, 250 P.3d 592 (Colo. App.

   <P></P>
   <T>
    <B>Preliminary hearing does not alter proposition that accused entitled to one trial
on merits.</B>
Although a preliminary hearing provides the defendant with an early opportunity to
question the government's case, it is not designed to alter the basic proposition
that an accused is entitled to one trial on the merits of the charge. People
v. Quinn, 183 Colo. 245, 516 P.2d 420 (1973).</T>
   <P></P>
   <T>
    <B>Standards for determining probable cause at preliminary hearing</B> are:
(1) Probable cause is established when the evidence is sufficient to induce
a person of ordinary prudence and caution to a reasonable belief that the
defendant committed the crimes charged; (2) the evidence presented must
be viewed in the light most favorable to the prosecution; (3) if testimony
conflicts, the trial court must draw an inference for the prosecution; and
(4) the preliminary hearing is a screening device and not a trial. People

   <P></P>
   <T>
    <B>Judge without jurisdiction to adjudge ultimate guilt.</B> In a preliminary
hearing of
one charged with the commission of a crime, the judge is without jurisdiction
to adjudge
the ultimate guilt or innocence of the accused.
Ex parte Snyder, 110 Colo. 35, 129 P.2d 672 (1942).</T>
   <P></P>
   <T>Judging the merits of a case is for the trier of facts at trial and not
for the trial judge at a preliminary hearing. People v. District Court,
779 P.2d 385 (Colo. 1989).</T>
   <P></P>
   <T>
    <B>Hearsay and other evidence may be bulk of evidence at hearing.</B>
Hearsay and other evidence, which would be incompetent if offered
at the time of trial, may be the bulk of evidence at a preliminary hearing.
People v. Quinn, 183 Colo. 245,
516 P.2d 420 (1973).</T>
   <P></P>
   <T>
    <B>Hearsay evidence considered to establish probable cause.</B>
Hearsay evidence, which would otherwise be inadmissible at the trial, may
be considered for purposes of establishing probable cause. People v. Williams,
628 P.2d 1011 (Colo. 1981).</T>
   <P></P>
   <T>
    <B>Prosecution satisfies minimum requirements for use of hearsay at preliminary
hearing if it:</B> (1) Presents some competent nonhearsay evidence that addresses an
essential element of the offense; and (2) presents the hearsay evidence through a witness
who is connected to the offense or its investigation rather than someone merely reading
from a report. In this case, the prosecution satisfied the status elements of the offense
through nonhearsay testimony and produced the victim's testimony (hearsay) through the
investigating officer who was familiar with the case. People v. Huggins, 220 P.3d 977
(Colo. App. 2009).</T>
   <P></P>
   <T>
    <B>Court's failure to apply correct standard for use of hearsay at preliminary hearing
was abuse of discretion.</B> Applying the correct standard, the evidence presented at
the preliminary hearing established probable cause to believe the defendant committed
the
charged offenses. People v. Huggins, 220 P.3d 977 (Colo. App. 2009).</T>
   <P></P>
   <T>
    <B>Resolving admissibility of such evidence.</B> The admissibility at a
preliminary hearing of a confession which is alleged to be involuntary
or the admissibility of evidence that may have been seized in violation of
the fourth amendment to the United States Constitution need not be resolved
on the same basis that would
be required when such motion is properly before the trial court or at the time of the
trial. People v. Quinn, 183 Colo. 245,
516 P.2d 420 (1973).</T>
   <P></P>

    <B>Failure to establish an articulable suspicion</B> for stopping defendant
or probable cause for arrest at preliminary hearing is not grounds for
dismissal of charges. People v. Brisbin, 727 P.2d 374 (Colo. 1986).</T>

   <P></P>
   <T>
    <B>Preliminary hearing deemed waived if not demanded.</B>
The statutory right to receive a preliminary hearing is not absolute and
requires that either the defendant or his attorney, or the prosecuting
attorney,
file a written motion demanding the preliminary hearing; if the defendant
fails to file a written motion for a preliminary hearing, he is deemed to
have waived his right to demand one. People v. Moody, 630 P.2d 74 (Colo. 1981).</T>
   <P></P>
   <T>
    <B>A defendant charged with a class four felony is entitled to a preliminary hearing
on an
offense so long as the defendant is in custody for that offense. </B>A defendant who is
in
custody for an unrelated conviction is still in custody for the offense for which the
preliminary
hearing is requested if the defendant has not posted bond on those charges. People v.
Subjack,
2021 CO 10, 480 P.3d 114 (overruling People v. Taylor, 104 P.3d 269 (Colo. App.
2004), and
People v. Pena, 250 P.3d 592 (Colo. App. 2009)).</T>
   <P></P>
   <T>
    <B>A defendant, charged with a class five felony is conferred the right to a
preliminary hearing only if that defendant is in custody for the offense for which the
preliminary hearing is requested.</B> The defendant's right to a preliminary hearing is
lost under the circumstance that he or she is in custody for an offense other than that for
which the preliminary hearing is requested. People v. Taylor, 104 P.3d 269 (Colo. App.
2004), overruled in People v. Subjack, 2021 CO 10, 480 P.3d 114.</T>
   <P></P>
   <T>
    <B>Refusal to appear constitutes waiver.</B>
In addition to an express written waiver, refusal by a defendant to appear
at a scheduled preliminary hearing where the county judge had advised the
defendant's attorney that the defendant's presence was required constitutes
an implied waiver and extinguishes the defendant's right to a preliminary
hearing in county court. People v. Abbott, 638 P.2d 781 (Colo. 1981).</T>
   <P></P>
   <T>
    <B>As does failure to appear.</B>
Where it is clear that a defendant was apprised of his right to a hearing
and of the date on which he was required to appear, the failure of both
the defendant and his attorney to appear constitutes an implied waiver of the
preliminary hearing. People v. Abbott, 638 P.2d 781 (Colo. 1981).</T>
   <P></P>
   <T>
    <B>Application for deferred sentencing does not constitute waiver of right
to preliminary hearing.</B> Celestine v. District Court, 199 Colo. 514, 610
P.2d 1342 (1980).</T>
   <P></P>
   <T>
    <B>Effect of waiver of preliminary hearing.</B> If the defendant elects to waive
the
preliminary hearing and to proceed to trial, the waiver operates as an admission
by the defendant that sufficient evidence does exist to establish
probable cause that the defendant committed the crimes
charged. People ex rel. Farina v. District Court, 184 Colo. 406,
521 P.2d 778 (1974).</T>
   <P></P>
   <T>An express written waiver by a defendant of his right to a preliminary
hearing operates identically to a failure to file within the time limit
prescribed by Crim. P. 5(a)(5), both requiring the defendant's
case to be bound over for trial. People v. Abbot, 638 P.2d 781 (Colo. 1981).</T>
   <P></P>
   <T>
    <B>Once a county court has bound a defendant over to the district court for trial, the
district court is without authority or power to grant the defendant a preliminary
hearing.</B> People v. Taylor, 104 P.3d 269 (Colo. App. 2004), overruled in People v.
Subjack, 2021 CO 10, 480 P.3d 114.</T>
   <P></P>
   <T>
    <B>District court cannot restore waived right.</B>
Under the Colorado rules of criminal procedure and the statutes of this state,
a district court is not vested with the power to restore a defendant's
statutory right to a preliminary hearing once the defendant had waived that

   <P></P>
   <T>
    <B>Where district court finds that defendant's waiver of right to preliminary hearing
is ineffective,</B> the district court has the authority to restore defendant's right to a
preliminary hearing. People v. Nichelson, 219 P.3d 1064 (Colo. 2009).</T>
   <P></P>
   <T>
    <B>Defendant entitled to a preliminary hearing on all class 1, 2, or 3 felonies even
when the felony classification results from a sentence enhancer.</B> People v. Simpson,

   <P></P>
   <T>
    <B>Defendant entitled to a preliminary hearing pursuant to criteria of subsection
(1)(b)(II) for a class 4 felony driving under the influence (DUI).</B> Defendant was

enhancer. People v. Tafoya, 2019 CO 13, 434 P.3d 1193.</T>
   <P></P>
   <T>
    <B>Defendant who is not in custody entitled to a preliminary hearing pursuant to

requires the imposition of a mandatory period of incarceration.</B> People v. Huckabay,
2020 CO 42, 463 P.3d 283.</T>
   <P></P>
   <T>Court erred in denying preliminary hearing for defendant charged with felony DUI,
which requires mandatory sentencing to a period incarceration which could include
incarceration either in the department of corrections or in county jail. People v.
Huckabay, 2020 CO 42, 463 P.3d 283.</T>
   <P></P>
   <T>
    <B>Defendant entitled to a preliminary hearing when special offender allegation
affects the level of offense defendant is accused of and charged with, regardless of
whether the special offender allegation is deemed an element or a sentence
enhancer.</B> But sentence enhancer counts that seek solely to punish a defendant more
severely for committing a crime charged in another count do not qualify for a preliminary
hearing. People v. Vanness, 2020 CO 18, 458 P.3d 901 (overruling People v. Garcia, 176
P.3d 872 (Colo. App. 2007)).</T>

    <B>Defendant not entitled to preliminary hearing because the substantive offense
with which defendant was charged was a misdemeanor.</B> People v. Garcia, 176 P.3d
872 (Colo. App. 2007), overruled in People v. Vanness, 2020 CO 18, 458 P.3d 901.</T>
   <P></P>
   <T>The charge of habitual domestic violence offender is a sentence enhancer which, if
proven, would enhance the level of the misdemeanor offense to a class 5 felony and
would require mandatory sentencing. People v. Garcia, 176 P.3d 872 (Colo. App. 2007),
overruled in People v. Vanness, 2020 CO 18, 458 P.3d 901.</T>
   <P></P>
   <T>
    <B>Habitual criminal counts.</B> Inasmuch as habitual criminal
counts do not constitute "offenses", probable cause need not be
established in the preliminary hearing to bind these charges
over to the district court. Maestas v. District Court, 189 Colo. 443,
541 P.2d 889 (1975).</T>
   <P></P>
   <T>
    <B>Habitual criminal charges are not substantive offense</B> and such a count
could
be
added to a complaint without another preliminary hearing.
People v. Hodge, 694 P.2d 1277 (Colo. App. 1984).</T>
   <P></P>
   <T>
    <B>Juvenile who was transferred to the district court from the juvenile court,</B>
after a transfer hearing where probable cause as to the offenses charged
was determined, was not entitled in the district court to another determination
of probable cause in the form of a preliminary hearing.
People v. Flanigan, 189 Colo. 43,
536 P.2d 41 (1975).</T>
   <P></P>
   <T>
    <B>All evidence presented in a preliminary hearing must be viewed in the
light most favorable to the prosecution,</B> and all inferences must be resolved
in favor of the prosecution. Abbott v. County Ct. in &amp; for County of Grand,
886 P.2d 730 (Colo. 1994).</T>
   <P></P>
   <T>
    <B>Where technical difficulties prevented defendant from obtaining a
transcript of the preliminary hearing, the judge abused his discretion in
denying defendant's motion for a second preliminary hearing.</B> Such motion
should
have been granted because the testimony presented at the first preliminary
hearing was directly relevant and significant to defendant's trial preparation,
the prosecution was expected to rely on testimony presented at the
preliminary hearing, and there was no alternative method of reconstructing the
testimony from the preliminary hearing. Harris v. District Court, 843 P.2d
1316 (Colo. 1993).</T>
   <P></P>
   <T>
    <B>District court does not have jurisdiction to review a county court's
finding of probable cause pursuant to C.R.C.P. 106.</B> Defendant may seek
extraordinary relief under C.A.R. 21. Abbott v. County Ct. in &amp; for County of
Grand, 886 P.2d 730 (Colo. 1994).</T>

    <B>Section limits power of courts to proceed.</B> In criminal cases the state

985 (Colo. 1986).</T>
   <P></P>
   <T>
    <B>Statute of limitations as amended in 2002 did not bar defendant's prosecution for
charge of sexual assault on a child by one in a position of trust</B> since the effective
date clause of the 2002 bill amending the statute did not conflict with the bill's
substantive
amendments. People v. Boston, 214 P.3d 507 (Colo. App. 2009), overruled in People v.
Summers, 208 P.3d 251 (Colo. 2009).</T>
   <P></P>
   <T>
    <B>Flat 10-year statute of limitations applies to felony sex offenses allegedly
committed against children pursuant to § 18-3-411 before June 3, 2002,</B> due to
an ambiguity created in the act enacting the 2002 amendments to § 18-3-411. The
general statutory construction rule of lenity requires that ambiguity in the meaning of a
criminal statute must be interpreted in favor of the defendant. Thus, effective date
section
of the 2002 legislation amending § 18-3-411 and stating that the act applies to
offenses committed on or after passage of the act (June 3, 2002) is controlling despite
July 1, 1992 date set forth in the substantive provisions of the statute. People v.
Summers, 208 P.3d 251 (Colo. 2009) (decided based upon § 18-3-411 as it existed
at the time the alleged crimes were committed prior to 2006 amendments) (overruling
People v. Boston, 214 P.3d 507 (Colo. App. 2009)).</T>

    <B>A defendant is absent from the state for statute of limitations purposes
when</B> he or she has been transferred by the department of corrections (DOC) to an
out-of-state facility to serve out the remainder of a state sentence. People v. Butler, 2017
COA 117, 431 P.3d 643.</T>
   <P></P>
   <T>
    <B>Applicable limitations period tolled while defendant was incarcerated by DOC
in another state.</B> Even though defendant was sent out of state by the DOC and the
DOC maintained jurisdiction over him while he was in another state, he was,
nonetheless, "absent" from the state. The general assembly did not include in subsection
(2) language contemplating a defendant's reason for being out of the state, nor whether
the defendant was out of the state voluntarily. People v. Butler, 2017 COA 117, 431 P.3d
643.</T>
   <P></P>
   <T>
    <B>Subsection (8)(a.5) eliminates the statute of limitations for</B> prosecution of
sexual assaults committed after July 1, 1991, where the defendant's identity is determined
in whole or in part by his or her DNA and the offense was reported to a law enforcement
agency within 10 years after the commission of the offense. The 10-year statute of
limitations in subsection (8)(a) remains in effect for any sexual assault committed
between July 1, 1984, and July 1, 1991, and for sexual assaults committed after July 1,
1991, that do not satisfy the statutory criteria in subsection (8)(a.5). People v. Hicks, 262
P.3d 916 (Colo. App. 2011).</T>
   <P></P>
   <T>
    <B>Subsection (8)(a.5) does not require that the victim be the person who reported
the offense to a law enforcement agency.</B> People v. Shores, 2016 COA 129, 412
P.3d
894.</T>
   <P></P>
   <T>
    <B>Subsection (8)(a.5) applies when DNA evidence plays some role in establishing
a defendant's participation in a sexual assault.</B> It is not limited to just when DNA
evidence "determines" the defendant's identity. The fact that defendant was considered a
suspect before the DNA results does limit the application of subsection (8)(a.5). People
v. Sims, 2019 COA 66, 457 P.3d 719.</T>
   <P></P>
   <T>
    <B>Manner of proof.</B> When the bar of the statute of limitations is raised by
a plea of not guilty,
proof must be made by the state showing that its right to prosecute and punish
for the offense alleged
is not barred. Where the state's own indictment makes the time element
material there is no need of further
proof. It then is merely the duty of a trial court to apply the statute and
quash the indictment. Bustamante
v. District Court, 138 Colo. 97, 329 P.2d 1013 (1958).</T>
   <P></P>
   <T>
    <B>Prohibition is proper remedy.</B> Where a trial court is without jurisdiction to
try
defendant under
an indictment showing on its face that prosecution is barred by the statute of limitations,
prohibition is
the proper remedy for relief. Bustamante v. District Court, 138 Colo. 97, 329 P.2d 1013
(1958).</T>
   <P></P>
   <T>
    <B>Section applies to offenses relating to banks.</B> Offenses denounced by
§ 11-11-102,
relating to receipt of deposits during insolvency by banks, are felonies within the
three-year
limitation of this section. People v. Godding, 55 Colo. 579, 136 P. 1011 (1913).</T>
   <P></P>
   <T>
    <B>Section also applies where felony is charged and lesser offense is proved.</B>
Where a
criminal
information
charges grand larceny, that will not prevent the operation of this section where the
offense
upon
conviction proves to be of a lesser grade, prosecution for which is barred by the statute.
Drott v. People, 71 Colo. 383, 206 P. 797 (1922).</T>
   <P></P>
   <T>
    <B>Defendant's request for a lesser offense instruction constituted a waiver of the
statute of limitations.</B> Subsection (12) creates an exception to the applicable statute
of limitations where the defendant has requested a lesser included or nonincluded
offense. People v. Lowry, 160 P.3d 396 (Colo. App. 2007).</T>
   <P></P>
   <T>
    <B>Under subsection (12), a plea of guilty to facilitate the disposition of a case
constitutes a waiver of the statute of limitations.</B> Defendant waived her right to
raise the statute of limitations as a defense to the amount of restitution ordered. People v.
Wilson, 251 P.3d 507 (Colo. App. 2010); People ex rel. K.W., 2012 COA 151, 317 P.3d
1237.</T>
   <P></P>
   <T>
    <B>Subsection (12) applies when the prosecution agreed to allow a juvenile
defendant to participate in a diversion program</B> as an alternative to prosecuting a
petition for delinquency, because the diversion program was offered as an alternative to
"facilitate the disposition of the case". People ex rel. K.W., 2012 COA 151, 317 P.3d
1237.</T>
   <P></P>
   <T>
    <B>Section also applies to complaints.</B> The statute of limitations governing
criminal
offenses classed as misdemeanors
makes specific use of the words "indictment", "information", and "complaint".
People v. Read, 132 Colo.
390, 288 P.2d 347 (1955).</T>
   <P></P>
   <T>
    <B>"Complaint" for purposes of this section includes a felony complaint that
has been filed in a county court to commence felony criminal proceedings.</B>
Higgins v. People, 868 P.2d 371 (Colo. 1994).</T>
   <P></P>
   <T>
    <B>Indictment charging embezzlement of public money defective.</B> Where an
indictment
makes a blanket charge of embezzlement of public money averring two dates, one
of which is so remote
as to be barred by the statute, it is defective. Bustamante v. District Court,
138 Colo. 97, 329
P.2d 1013 (1958).</T>
   <P></P>
   <T>
    <B>In rape cases the complaint must state a specific date or time when it is
alleged the transaction
occurred.</B> The district attorney may select any act upon which he will rely
for a conviction, within
the period prescribed in this section for felonies. Laycock v. People, 66
Colo. 441, 182 P. 880
(1919).</T>
   <P></P>
   <T>In a prosecution for rape where all the acts proved were within the statute
of limitation, the
prosecution had the right to select from among them that upon which it would
rely for conviction;
and in the absence of any express election from the record it will be presumed
that the prosecution
elected to stand by the offense it first introduced evidence to establish; and
that evidence of other
acts was not introduced to prove substantive offenses, but in corroboration and
explanation of the
evidence of the act charged. Mitchell v. People, 24 Colo. 532, 52 P. 67
(1898);
Abbott v. People, 89 Colo. 121, 299 P. 1053 (1931).</T>
   <P></P>
   <T>
    <B>Evidence of acts barred by the statute is inadmissible.</B> In a prosecution
for rape it was
error to admit evidence of other acts of sexual intercourse that were barred by
the statute of limitation.
Bigcraft v. People, 30 Colo. 298, 70 P. 417 (1902).</T>
   <P></P>
   <T>It is error to permit the defendant to be cross-examined, over objection, as
to alleged illicit relations
with the prosecuting witness occurring more than three years prior to the
filing of the information.
Curtis v. People, 72 Colo. 350, 211 P. 381 (1922).</T>
   <P></P>
   <T>In a prosecution for rape evidence of other acts of sexual intercourse with
the prosecuting witness, committed
within the period of the statute of limitations, is clearly admissible.
Schuette v. People, 33 Colo.
325, 80 P. 890 (1905).</T>
   <P></P>
   <T>
    <B>And its admission is reversible error.</B> Abbott v. People, 89 Colo. 121,
299 P. 1053 (1931).</T>
   <P></P>
   <T>
    <B>Special verdict unnecessary.</B> Special verdict on a plea in bar, based
upon the running of the
statute of limitations, is not necessary where the issue is presented to the
jury under the general
issue without objection. Dill v. People, 94 Colo. 230, 29 P.2d 1035 (1934).</T>
   <P></P>
   <T>
    <B>When jury instruction on limitation period proper.</B>
Instructing the jury that they can find the defendant guilty of sexual assault
on a child if they find that the evidence shows that the crime has occurred
at any time within three years prior to the filing of the information is
proper if evidence of only one transaction is admitted and there is some
question as to the date of the incident. People v. Estorga, 200 Colo. 78,
612 P.2d 520 (1980).</T>
   <P></P>
   <T>
    <B>Amendment of information at close of evidence was permissible</B> where
amendment related to acts occurring within the statutory limitation period,
date of offense was neither a material element nor an issue at trial, and the
amendment did not involve an altered accusation or require a different defense
strategy from the one defendant had chosen under the initial information.
People v. Metcalf, 926 P.2d 133 (Colo. App. 1996).</T>
   <P></P>
   <T>
    <B>The statute of limitations set forth in § 13-80-102,</B> and not that in
this section, applies to a theft claim brought under § 18-4-405. Michaelson
v. Michaelson, 923 P.2d 237 (Colo. App. 1995).</T>
   <P></P>
   <T>
    <B>General assembly intended the discovery tolling provision of the statute of
limitations to be applicable to theft committed against at-risk adults. </B>Theft against
an at-risk adult enhances a general theft crime. Accordingly, it is immaterial that the
discovery tolling provision does not expressly include or exclude thefts committed
against at-risk adults. People v. McKinney, 99 P.3d 1038 (Colo. 2004).</T>
   <P></P>
   <T>
    <B>Because the discovery tolling provision of the statute of limitations, subsection
(4.5)(c), applies to general theft, it also includes theft from an at-risk adult,</B> which is
an enhanced form of general theft. Accordingly, the period within which a prosecution
for theft against an at-risk adult must be commenced does not begin to run until the time
the victim discovers the criminal act. People v. McKinney, 99 P.3d 1038 (Colo. 2004).</T>

   <P></P>
   <T>
    <B>The doctrine of laches is applicable to persons convicted of class one
felonies.</B> The absence of a limitations period for class one felonies in subsection (1)
is because the general assembly determined that it would be inappropriate to establish a
fixed period for post-conviction motions for the most serious offenses. Such a legislative
determination does not manifest a clear intent to deprive courts of their preexisting ability
to apply the doctrine of laches to class one felony cases. Trial courts may continue to
assess individually whether equitable considerations should preclude post-conviction
relief when a defendant has been convicted of a class one felony. People v. Robbins, 87

certain circumstances, laches may work to bar defendant's claim for relief where this

    <B>This section violates due process</B> of law under the federal and state
constitutions because it precludes collateral challenges to the constitutional

challenge was the result of circumstances
amounting to justifiable excuse or excusable neglect.

    <B>Constitutionality.</B> The construction that this section applies to

   <P></P>
   <T>The application of this section to bar a motion to challenge a prior
conviction in an unrelated proceeding does not violate the constitution. The
justifiable excuse or excusable neglect exception in subsection (2)(d) provides
a defendant with a meaningful opportunity to challenge allegedly
unconstitutional convictions. People v. Deskins, 904 P.2d 1358 (Colo. App. 1995),

    <B>Defendant lacks standing to challenge constitutionality</B> of §
16-5-402 based on the argument that subsection (3) violates due process
because subsection (3) is severable from the other provisions of this section
that are directly implicated, subsection (3) has no application to the present
proceeding, and the defendant failed to show he is effected by the alleged
unconstitutionality of subsection (3). It is best to defer validity of
subsection
(3) until the issue is presented by one whose rights are affected and who has
an interest in challenging the statute. People v. Heitzman, 852 P.2d 443

Although a distinction exists between collateral attacks and other types of
postconviction relief, a successful attack under Crim. P. 35 results in

    <B>Time bar in this section does not apply to a defendant's Crim. P. 32(d)
motion.</B> This section imposes time limitations for commencing collateral attacks on

not a collateral attack on a judgment of conviction because no judgment of conviction

    <B>Defendant's motion alleging a violation of § 16-14-102(3) was time-barred
under this section because it did not allege a jurisdictional defect.</B> While violation
of § 16-14-102 (3) would have entitled the defendant to dismissal of the charges,
regardless of whether he suffered any prejudice, it did not deprive the court of
jurisdiction. Therefore, the trial court properly dismissed defendant's motion as untimely

    <B>Statutory limitations in this section do not usurp the supreme court's

   <P></P>
   <T>In determining if the justifiable excuse or excusable neglect exception
applies, consider the following: (1) Circumstances existing throughout the
entire period from the inception of the conviction in question; (2) Relative
strengths of various interests at stake; (3) Existence of circumstances or
outside influences preventing a challenge to a prior conviction; (4) Extent
to which a defendant having reason to question the constitutionality of a
conviction investigates its validity and takes advantage of avenues of relief
available to him; (5) Whether the defendant had any previous need to
challenge a conviction; (6) Whether the defendant either knew that it was
constitutionally infirm or had reason to question its validity; (7) Whether
the defendant had other means of preventing the government's use of the
conviction so that a postconviction challenge was previously unnecessary; and
(8) Extent of time between the date of conviction and the defendant's

The "excusable neglect" exception to this section cannot be read so

back to the original motion. People v. Cummins, 37 P.3d 507 (Colo. App. 2001).</T>
   <P></P>
   <T>
    <B>Ineffective assistance of counsel in Crim. P. 35(c) proceedings is colorable
grounds for appointment of conflict-free counsel and a trial court hearing on justifiable
excuse and excusable neglect.</B> The allegation that postconviction counsel failed to
inform the court of the constitutional limitations of defendant's sentence, which in turn
resulted in a sentence twice the constitutionally permissible level, is within the standard
for measuring ineffective assistance of counsel under Strickland v. Washington, 466 U.S.
668 (1984). Close v. People, 180 P.3d 1015 (Colo. 2008).</T>
   <P></P>
   <T>
    <B>Justifiable excuse or excusable neglect would be established</B> if the public
defender's conflict of interest was the reason for not filing a motion for post-conviction
relief on behalf of defendant. People v. Chang, 179 P.3d 240 (Colo. App. 2007).</T>
   <P></P>
   <T>
    <B>Justifiable excuse or excusable neglect would be established</B> if the public
defender's failure to file a motion for post-conviction relief on behalf of defendant was
the result of ineffective counsel. People v. Chang, 179 P.3d 240 (Colo. App. 2007).</T>
   <P></P>
   <T>
    <B>Because there is no requirement that appellate counsel advise a defendant of
time limitations for seeking postconviction relief, the absence of such advice is not a
justifiable excuse for defendant's neglect.</B> People v. Alexander, 129 P.3d 1051
(Colo.
App. 2005).</T>
   <P></P>
   <T>
    <B>Defendant's misplaced reliance on parole board's interpretation of law</B>
concerning parole decisions for sex offenders did not constitute justifiable
excuse or excusable neglect to attack conviction outside of three-year
period.
People v. Perez, 895 P.2d 1090 (Colo. App. 1994).</T>
   <P></P>
   <T>
    <B>A defendant's intentional abandonment of claims raised at an earlier
proceeding does not amount to justifiable excuse or excusable neglect</B> that
would permit a late filing of a postconviction motion. People v. Abeyta,
923 P.2d 318 (Colo. App. 1996).</T>
   <P></P>
   <T>
    <B>Ineffective assistance of counsel can constitute justifiable excuse or excusable
neglect.</B> People v. Valdez, 178 P.3d 1269 (Colo. App. 2007).</T>
   <P></P>
   <T>
    <B>Mere failure to challenge a conviction</B> does not establish ineffective
assistance of counsel nor constitute excusable neglect or justifiable
excuse. People v. Boehmer, 872 P.2d 1320 (Colo. App. 1993);
People v. Penrod, 892 P.2d 383 (Colo. App. 1994);
People v. Rhorer, 946 P.2d 503 (Colo. App. 1997),
rev'd on other grounds, 967 P.2d 147 (Colo. 1998).</T>
   <P></P>
   <T>
    <B>As a matter of law, postconviction counsel's seven-year delay in filing a
supplemental motion in a challenge that was filed within the time limits prescribed by
this
section was, in light of all the circumstances, outside the wide range of professionally
competent assistance.</B> People v. Valdez, 178 P.3d 1269 (Colo. App. 2007).</T>
   <P></P>
   <T>
    <B>It is appropriate for a trial court to raise the issue sua sponte of whether a
defendant's motion for post-conviction relief is untimely</B> under this section. People
v. Xiong, 940 P.2d 1119 (Colo. App. 1997).</T>
   <P></P>
   <T>
    <B>If a defendant's motion for post-conviction relief is untimely, the trial court may
deny the motion without conducting a hearing</B> if the defendant has failed to allege
facts which, if true, would establish justifiable excuse or excusable neglect. People v.
Xiong, 940 P.2d 1119 (Colo. App. 1997).</T>
   <P></P>
   <T>
    <B>The timely commencement of a collateral attack fails to toll the limitations
period
with respect to additional postconviction claims</B> not contained in the timely filed
motion. People v. Ambos, 51 P.3d 1070 (Colo. App. 2002).</T>
   <P></P>
   <T>
    <B>For purposes of this section and postconviction review, a "conviction"
occurs when</B> the trial court enters judgment and sentence is imposed, if
there is no appeal; if an appeal is pursued, then the conviction is not final
until the appellate process is exhausted. People v. Hampton, 857 P.2d 441
(Colo. App. 1992), aff'd, 876 P.2d 1236 (Colo. 1994); People v. Clouse, 74 P.3d 336
(Colo.
App. 2002).</T>
   <P></P>
   <T>Where a defendant initiates a direct appeal from a conviction, this section's
three-year
limitations period does not begin to run until the appeal is exhausted; tolling of the
period
is not warranted during the pendency of an appeal from the denial of a Crim. P. 35(c)
motion. People v. Ambos, 51 P.3d 1070 (Colo. App. 2002).</T>
   <P></P>
   <T>
    <B>Direct appeal not reinstated extending the time periods of this section.</B>
When, under a Crim. P. 35 motion, post-conviction court appoints counsel to pursue any
error in the original appeal, it is not reinstating defendant's direct appeal. People v.
Shepard, 151 P.3d 580 (Colo. App. 2006).</T>
   <P></P>
   <T>
    <B>Resentencing, upon revocation of probation or rejection from community
corrections, does not create a new "conviction".</B> The statutory sentencing scheme,
under which a defendant who receives probation may subsequently have his or her
probation revoked and receive a sentence to community corrections or to the department
of corrections, contemplates a system of escalating sentencing alternatives available to
the
court. Hence, resentencing after a revocation of probation or a rejection from community
corrections does not result in the entry of a new judgment of conviction for purposes of
this section. People v. McPherson, 53 P.3d 679 (Colo. App. 2001).</T>
   <P></P>
   <T>
    <B>The date of conviction for purposes of this section is the date the appeal is
exhausted,</B> not the date of the amended mittimus reflecting the reduction of
sentence,
where a Crim. P. 35(b) motion has been filed and granted after the conclusion of a direct
appeal. People v. Metcalf, 979 P.2d 581 (Colo. App. 1999).</T>
   <P></P>
   <T>
    <B>The date of resentencing, after defendant violated the conditions of her
probation, does not trigger the commencement of a new three-year period for collateral
attack.</B> Even though a Crim. P. 35(b) motion was filed within three years after the
defendant was sentenced to the department of corrections for violation of her conditions
of probation, the motion was untimely because it was filed more than three years after the
date the judgment of conviction was entered. People v. Cummins, 37 P.3d 507 (Colo.
App. 2001); People v. Collier, 151 P.3d 668 (Colo. App. 2006).</T>
   <P></P>
   <T>
    <B>Subsection (1.5) is discretionary</B> and a court may elect to address a
defendant's
claims on the merits. People v. Kilgore, 992 P.2d 661 (Colo. App. 1999).</T>
   <P></P>
   <T>
    <B>Applied</B> in People v. Smith, 856 P.2d 26 (Colo. App. 1992);

relevant cases construing those provisions have been included in the

   <P></P>
   <T>
    <B>The object of this section</B> is to secure to a party charged with crime a
fair and impartial trial
by a jury in a county uninfluenced by local bias or prejudice. People ex rel.
Burke v. District Court,
60 Colo. 1, 152 P. 149 (1915).</T>
   <P></P>
   <T>
    <B>To support a request for a change of venue, a defendant must establish one of
two circumstances.</B> First the defendant can show that the pretrial publicity is so
massive, pervasive, and prejudicial as to create a presumption that the defendant will be
denied a fair trial. Alternatively, the defendant can demonstrate that any pretrial publicity
will create actual prejudice and hostility in the jury panel. The defendant must show
actual prejudice -- a nexus between pretrial publicity and a panel of partial jurors. People
v. Hankins, 2014 COA 71, 361 P.3d 1033.</T>
   <P></P>
   <T>Pretrial publicity was extensive, but not so massive, pervasive, and prejudicial as to
create a presumption that defendant was denied a fair trial. People v. Hankins, 2014
COA 71, 361 P.3d 1033.</T>
   <P></P>
   <T>Record did not show actual prejudice. Only one impaneled juror said he had formed
an opinion, and he adamantly declared that he could set it aside. People v. Hankins, 2014

    <B>The denial of a fair trial may be presumed when pretrial

   <P></P>
   <T>
    <B>Prejudice must exist in all of several attached counties.</B> Where several
counties
are
attached for
judicial purposes, a petition for change of venue, founded upon prejudice of the
inhabitants
must
show that
such prejudice exists in all of the counties so attached. Fitzgerald v. People, 1 Colo. 56
(1867).</T>
   <P></P>
   <T>
    <B>Motion for change of venue properly denied.</B>
Motion for change of venue on ground that pretrial publicity made
fair trial impossible was properly denied where the voir
dire amply demonstrated the absence of prejudice and the
ability of the jurors to set aside any opinions that they
may have received from the news media. People v. Medina,
185 Colo. 101, 521 P.2d 1257 (1974).</T>
   <P></P>
   <T>Trial court did not abuse its discretion in denying the change of venue where the trial
court noted that media coverage of the crime was balanced and was not sensational and
that
some newspaper articles expressed sympathy for the defendant. Further as a result of the
court's voir dire examination of the prospective jurors concerning the effect of publicity,
jurors who expressed knowledge of the case were either excused for cause or expressed
an
ability to put aside any opinions they had formed about the case. People v. Dore, 997
P.2d
1214 (Colo. App. 1999).</T>
   <P></P>
   <T>
    <B>When juror's assurances of impartiality not conclusive.</B>
Where a defendant demonstrates the existence of a pattern of deep and bitter
prejudice throughout the community where he is to be tried, a juror's assurance
that he will be fair and impartial is not conclusive. People v. Botham,

   <T>
    <B>And decision will not be reversed except where discretion is abused.</B> In
passing
upon an
application for a change of venue on the ground of prejudice of the inhabitants, the trial
court
should exercise a sound discretion; it is only in case of manifest abuse of such discretion
that
its
decision will be reversed by the supreme court. Power v. People, 17 Colo. 178, 28 P.

   <P></P>
   <T>
    <B>And facts should be sufficient to inform judge of causes relied on.</B> The law
contemplates
that upon application for change of venue, facts shall be stated sufficient to inform the
judge
of
the
nature of the causes for the change, and their alleged foundation. Hughes v. People, 5
Colo.

    <B>Attack of denial of motion is by appeal.</B> If appellant desires to attack the

    <B>Means to insure fair trial not appellate concern.</B>
Regardless of the means imposed by the trial judge to insure the accused's
constitutional right to a fair trial by a panel of impartial jurors, the
critical inquiry on appellate review is whether the chosen means did in
fact preserve the accused's right to a fair trial. People v. Botham, 629

    <B>Insufficient ground for change.</B> The fact that the deceased was a banker

    <B>Prejudice of jury moot if defendant elects trial to the court.</B> By electing to
try
the
case
to the court, appellant was foreclosed from asserting error in the denial of a change of
venue.
His contention in presenting his motion for a change of venue was that he could not
obtain
trial by
a fair and impartial jury in the district in which he was proceeding. Nowhere did he
complain that
he
could not obtain a fair trial before the trial judge. Under such circumstances, the issue of
whether
the
change of venue should have been granted became moot. Brisbin v. Schauer, 176 Colo.

to another county within the same judicial district if it is shown that the
offense was committed in more than one county within the same judicial district
and if the court is satisfied that the interests of justice would be served by
transferring the action to the other county.</SECTION-TEXT>

(1)<M>Any person charged with crimes in more
than one county of this state may apply to the district
attorney of one of said counties to be charged with all
crimes so that he may enter into a disposition and be sentenced for them in
that single county. The application shall contain a description
of all charged crimes and the name of the county in which each
was committed.</M>
  <P N="(2)"></P>
  <T>(2)<M>Upon receipt of the application, the district attorney shall
prepare an information charging all the charged crimes and
naming in each count the county where each was committed. He
shall send a copy of the information to the district attorney of
each other county in which the defendant stands charged,
together with a statement that the defendant has applied
to enter into a disposition in the county of application. Upon receipt of
the information and statement, the district attorney of the
other county may execute a consent in writing allowing the
defendant to enter a plea of guilty in the county to which
application has been made to the crime charged in the
information and committed in the other county and send it
to the district attorney who prepared the information.</M>
  </T>
  <P N="(3)"></P>
  <T>(3)<M>If necessary, the district attorney shall amend the information so
that it includes only the offenses for which he has received written consent
from the district attorney of other counties, and
he shall file the information in any
court of his county having jurisdiction to try or accept a plea
of guilty to the most serious crime alleged therein.
The defendant then
may enter a plea of guilty to all offenses alleged to have been
committed in the county where the court is located and to all
offenses alleged to have been committed in other counties as to which
consents have been executed pursuant to subsection (2) of this section.
Before entering his plea of guilty, the defendant shall waive in writing
any right to be tried in the county where the crime was committed. The
district attorney of the county where the crime was committed need not
be present when the plea is made, but his written consent shall be filed
with the court.</M>

the defendant has pleaded guilty under this section.</M>
  </T>
  <P N="(5)"></P>
  <T>(5)<M>The clerk of the court in the county where the plea is made
shall file a copy of the judgment of conviction with the clerk
in each county where a crime covered by the plea was committed.
The district attorney in each of said counties shall then move
to dismiss any charges covered by the plea of guilty which are
pending against the defendant in his county, and the same shall
thereupon be dismissed.</M>

   <T>
    <B>Annotator's note.</B> Since § 16-6-201 is similar to
repealed § 39-9-2, C.R.S. 1963, CSA, C. 170, § 1, and laws
antecedent thereto, relevant cases construing those provisions have
been included in the annotations to this section.</T>

   <T>
    <B>The object of this section is to secure to an accused a
fair and impartial trial</B> by a judge uninfluenced by bias or
prejudice against the party charged. People ex rel. Burke

that no person is forced to stand trial before a judge with a bent of mind.

be prejudiced against the petitioner, the judge's duty is to sit on the

    <B>Defendant does not lose right to change upon reindictment.</B>
The right of the accused to an impartial judge is not waived or

    <B>Grounds identical to those in Crim. P. 21(b).</B>
The grounds for disqualification set out in this section are identical
to those set out in Crim. P. 21(b). People v. District Court,
192 Colo. 503, 560 P.2d 828 (1977);

   <P></P>
   <T>
    <B>Test of judge's qualifications is same as that for jurors.</B>
Where the issues involved require the judge to pass upon the
facts, and it is solely a question of fact which is presented
for his consideration and determination, the same test of his
qualifications to determine the matter should be applied as
would be in determining the qualifications of jurors in the
premises. People ex rel. Burke v. District Court, 60 Colo.

   <P></P>
   <T>
    <B>General rule.</B> This section by express terms makes the
judge incompetent to try a case if he is in any way interested,
or in any way prejudiced, or if he shall have been of counsel
in the cause. People ex rel. Burke v. District Court, 60 Colo.
1, 152 P. 149 (1915).</T>
   <P></P>
   <T>
    <B>Subjective conclusion of rudeness not ground for disqualification.</B>
It does not comport with sound judicial policy or the intent of either
Crim. P. 21(b) or this section to require disqualification
of a judge solely on the basis of subjective conclusions that he was
discourteous or rude.

      <B>A disqualifying interest of a judge must necessarily relate

Colo. 135, 248 P.2d 287 (1952).</T>
     <P></P>
     <T>
      <B>It must be direct, apparent, substantial,</B> certain, or
immediate, and not one which is only indirect, contingent,
incidental, remote, speculative, unreal, uncertain, inconsequential,
or merely theoretical. Kostal v. People, 160 Colo. 64, 414 P.2d

     <P></P>
     <T>
      <B>Sham action will not disqualify judge.</B> The filing of sham
or frivolous actions in which a judge is made a party for the sole
purpose of disqualifying him in the trial of another case should
not be allowed. Kostal v. People, 160 Colo. 64, 414 P.2d 123,

     <P></P>
     <T>
      <B>Facts showing interest are conclusive.</B> To be in any way
interested or to have been of counsel in the cause constitutes
conclusive incompetency, and from the existence of those facts,
or either of them, no other deduction can be made. People ex

560 P.2d 828 (1977).</T>
       <P></P>
       <T>Because appearances can be as damaging to public confidence in the
courts as actual bias or prejudice, a trial judge must scrupulously
avoid any appearance of bias or prejudice. People v. District

       <P></P>
       <T>
        <B>But mere expression of belief that judge would not give fair
trial does not show prejudice.</B> The mere expression of a
belief that the judge would not give the defendant a fair and
impartial trial, without the statement of a single fact upon
which such belief is based, is in no sense a compliance with
the requirements of this section that the prejudice of the
judge must be shown. Young v. People, 54 Colo. 293, 130
P. 1011 (1913).</T>
       <P></P>
       <T>
        <B>An appearance of impropriety cannot be inferred simply because the judge was a
member of the general public</B> that witnessed the fire started by defendant or because
the judge assisted in general relief efforts. People v. Barton, 121 P.3d 224 (Colo. App.
2004).</T>
       <P></P>
       <T>
        <B>However, numerous other allegations of the judge's personal involvement and
comments made by the judge during the sentencing hearing about his or her personal
experience</B> presented legally sufficient basis to create the appearance of prejudice
that could have prevented the judge from dealing fairly with the defendant. People v.
Barton, 121 P.3d 224 (Colo. App. 2004).</T>
       <P></P>
       <T>
        <B>A leaning or bias interfering with fairness will constitute
prejudice.</B> If the application discloses facts reasonably
tending to the conclusion that the judge has a leaning towards
one side of any question involved in the prosecution, or a bias
in relation to it, which may interfere with fairness in judgment,
he is prejudiced and incompetent within the meaning of this
section. People ex rel. Burke v. District Court, 60 Colo.
1, 152 P. 149 (1915); Walker v. People, 126 Colo. 135, 248
P.2d 287 (1952);
Smith v. District Court,
629 P.2d 1055 (Colo. 1981).</T>
       <P></P>
       <T>The facts will vary in accordance with the peculiar situation
pertaining, but, as a general rule, sufficient factual matters
must be stated to show bias and prejudice on the part of the
trial judge to the extent that it may reasonably and substantially
appear that his actions during the course of trial will be so
influenced against defendant that a fair and impartial trial
may not result. Walker v. People, 126 Colo. 135, 248 P.2d 287
(1952).</T>
       <P></P>
       <T>
        <B>And it exists if case is decided on considerations not connected
with facts.</B> In any law suit where the issues involved are not
determined alone from considerations that belong to them, there is
prejudice within the meaning of the law, and such prejudice is
necessarily against the party injured. People ex rel. Burke
v. District Court, 60 Colo. 1, 152 P. 149 (1915).</T>
       <P></P>
       <T>
        <B>Where no basis for disqualification.</B>
In the context of a confidential plea-bargaining conference,
conducted off-the-record and in chambers, and where the challenged
statement by the court implies nothing more than the judge's
belief that the proposed plea and sentence concessions
would not do justice, there is no basis for disqualification.
Sober v. District Court, 197 Colo. 250, 592 P.2d 400 (1979).</T>
       <P></P>
       <T>
        <B>It is not based upon judge's view of law.</B> The right to
disqualify the presiding judge is based upon an assumed prejudice
or bias on his part, and not upon his views regarding the law of
the case. Walker v. People, 126 Colo. 135, 248 P.2d 287 (1952);
Altobella v. People, 161 Colo. 177, 420 P.2d 832 (1966).</T>
       <P></P>
       <T>
        <B>Thus, personal opinions as to issues generally not regarded
as disqualifying judge.</B> Personal opinions of a trial judge
concerning issues in the cause before the court, or even as to
the guilt or innocence of a defendant in a criminal case, are
generally not regarded as disqualifying the judge unless his
opinions be so pronounced that it can reasonably be said that
he will be biased and prejudiced thereby during the trial.
Walker v. People, 126 Colo. 135, 248 P.2d 287 (1952).</T>
       <P></P>
       <T>Speculation by trial judge concerning possible appellate response to a
hypothetical review of the state's capital punishment statute does not provide
the basis for an inference of any prejudice by the judge with respect to
the defendant or his case. Rodriguez v. District Court, 719 P.2d 699 (Colo. 1986).</T>
       <P></P>
       <T>
        <B>Previous rulings of judge insufficient.</B> Previous rulings
of a presiding judge, although erroneous, numerous, and continuous,
especially when they are subject to review, are not sufficient to
show such bias or prejudice as would disqualify him. Walker v.
People, 126 Colo. 135, 248 P.2d 287 (1952); Altobella v. People,
161 Colo. 177, 420 P.2d 832 (1966).</T>
       <P></P>
       <T>
        <B>Judges are not disqualified solely on the basis that they were formerly employed
by the prosecutor's office.</B> Instead, when employed by that office, the judge to be
disqualified must have performed some role in the case or have obtained actual
knowledge
of disputed evidentiary facts of the case. People v. Julien, 47 P.3d 1194 (Colo. 2002).</T>
       <P></P>
       <T>
        <B>A judge is not required to sua sponte disqualify him- or herself when the judge
is related to a juror.</B> Richardson v. People, 2020 CO 46, 481 P.3d 1, cert. denied, --
U.S. --, -- S. Ct. --, 209 L. Ed. 2d 133 (2021).</T>
       <P></P>
       <T>
        <B>Nor does a judge have a duty to excuse a juror who is related to the judge</B>
in the absence of any contemporaneous objection. Richardson v. People, 2020 CO 46,
481 P.3d 1, cert. denied, -- U.S. --, -- S. Ct. --, 209 L. Ed. 2d 133 (2021).</T>
       <P></P>
       <T>
        <B>Judge not disqualified due to prior prosecution of defendant while employed by
prosecutor's office.</B> Judge's prosecution of defendant seven years earlier involved
similar but unrelated charges and resulted in a dismissal following defendant's successful
motion to suppress. Judge not required to recuse himself where judge had no knowledge
of evidentiary facts concerning the current case and no connection to the investigation,
preparation, and presentation of the case. People v. Flockhart, 310 P.3d 66 (Colo. App.
2009), aff'd in part and rev'd in part, 2013 CO 42, 304 P.3d 227.</T>
       <P></P>
       <T>
        <B>But trial judge, a former prosecutor, should have recused herself because she
had served in a supervisory capacity over the attorneys who investigated or
prosecuted</B> case at the time they filed the charges against defendant. People v.
Mentzer, 2020 COA 91, -- P.3d --.</T>
       <P></P>
       <T>
        <B>Prejudice must be directed to defendant individually or
as a member of group or organization.</B> The prejudice of a trial
judge must be shown to be directed toward the defendant,
individually, either as a result of personal dislike or feeling
against the defendant, or that such prejudice may have resulted
by reason of animosity toward some group or organization with
which the defendant may have been associated or closely affiliated.
Walker v. People, 126 Colo. 135, 248 P.2d 287 (1952).</T>
       <P></P>
       <T>
        <B>Bond orders did not establish bias.</B> The facts alleged
concerning revocation of defendant's bond, resetting the bond at
$100,000, and refusal to reduce the bond, when considered in
the procedural setting out of which the orders arose, are not
such as to establish to the satisfaction of a reasonable mind
that the presiding judge had a bias or a prejudice that would
in all probability prevent him from dealing fairly with the
defendant. Altobella v. People, 161 Colo. 177, 420 P.2d 832 (1966).</T>
       <P></P>
       <T>
        <B>There can be no presumption that a judge is intimidated by the outrage of
the community</B> in which the judge serves. Thus, motion for disqualification
properly denied where there was no allegation that the judge was in fact
intimidated by the community's animosity toward the defendant. People v.
Vecchio, 819 P.2d 533 (Colo. App. 1991).</T>
       <P></P>
       <T>
        <B>The trial court's statement that defendant's motion for a competency
hearing was a "ploy" to delay the trial</B> was adequately supported by what
the judge learned in his judicial capacity during argument on pretrial
motions
concerning the defendant's competency, and such a statement does not
constitute the kind of prejudice required for recusal. People v. Seigler,
832 P.2d 980 (Colo. App. 1991).</T>
       <P></P>
       <T>
        <B>Judge's concern for welfare of alleged victim does not establish the
reality or appearance of partiality.</B> Wilkerson v. District Ct., 925 P.2d
1373 (Colo. 1996).</T>
       <P></P>
       <T>
        <B>Defendant did not establish actual bias requiring disqualification of sentencing
judge.</B> While judge's statements that he would be "haunt[ed]" by his decision to
grant probation during defendant's prior criminal sentencing showed the judge was
affected by his prior decision to be lenient with defendant, they were not enough to
establish that the judge was unable to sentence defendant fairly. People v. Dobler, 2015
COA 25, 369 P.3d 686.</T>
       <P></P>
       <T>
        <B>Mere filing of complaint with the judicial performance commission,</B>
without more, does not establish sufficient grounds for recusal. Further, county court
judge's decision to recuse herself in seven prior cases does not lead to the conclusion that
she should permanently recuse herself in all cases involving the attorneys. Kane v.

   <P></P>
   <T>In all cases necessary material or pertinent facts should be
set out; in case of the prejudice of the judge, his attention

   <P></P>
   <T>A motion and accompanying affidavits requesting disqualification of a trial
judge from participating in a case properly assigned to that judge must
state facts from which it may be reasonably inferred that the judge has
a bias or prejudice with respect to the case, a party, or counsel. Rodriguez

   <P></P>
   <T>The requirement in this section that prejudice of the
judge must be shown is of the same effect as an earlier statute
by which the facts were expressly required to be stated. Young

   <P></P>
   <T>The mere statement of opinion or conclusion of the bias on
the part of the trial judge is not sufficient in a motion
seeking disqualification of a judge, and the facts from which
the incompetency or prejudice is inferred must be stated.
There has always been required, as essential to a proper
recusation, a statement of facts in the affidavits sufficient
to disclose the incompetency of the judge. Walker v. People,

   <T>
    <B>Affidavits need not state all essential facts.</B>
The affidavits in support of a motion for disqualification do not have to
contain every essential fact which establishes the judge's prejudice; it
is sufficient if the affidavits verify the facts set forth in the motion.

    <B>Motions for disqualification of a judge must be filed at

filing of such a motion promptly upon the service of the information
or at least by time of arraignment of the defendant in a criminal
case. Usually the bias or animosity of the judge will be known
to the defendant, or his counsel, at that time; hence the rule
requiring prompt action. It is conceivable that in certain
circumstances the fact of bias or prejudice on the part of a
judge might not be ascertainable for some time after the filing
of the information, but in such a situation a statement should
be forthcoming showing the reason why the petition was not
sooner filed. Walker v. People, 126 Colo. 135, 248 P.2d 287

that the judge or any employee was in any way personally victimized by the crime; or that

      <B>Sufficiency is a matter of law.</B> The finding of sufficiency

     <P></P>
     <T>
      <B>Thus, facts are accepted as true.</B> The change of judge
is conditioned, not upon the actual fact of his prejudice, but

notwithstanding they may be known to the judge and all mankind

     <P></P>
     <T>When it is sought to remove the judge because of his prejudice, the
law-making power of our state has not deemed it proper to vest in such judge
any discretion in the premises, and the judge whose competency is so
questioned can only pronounce the judgment of the law. He cannot
sit in judgment upon that which directly concerns himself. People

     <T>If the motion for disqualification be sufficient in form, and
whether the allegations therein contained be in fact true or false,
if they be set forth as facts they must be so accepted, and the judge
may perform no further duty than that of entering an order of
disqualification. He may not pass upon the facts. Walker v.
People, 126 Colo. 135, 248 P.2d 287 (1952).</T>
     <P></P>
     <T>The trial judge has no discretion in the matter of recusing

     <T>
      <B>Review of decision on motion.</B> Should the trial court conclude
that the motion and affidavits in support of change of judge are
insufficient to require the change, and a reviewing or superior
tribunal find the contrary, the question upon which the two
tribunals have differed is of law, not of fact. Therefore, the
finding of the trial court in such case can have no bearing
upon the issue when presented to a higher tribunal. People

     <P></P>
     <T>
      <B>Motion held sufficient.</B> Motion for disqualification of respondent
judge with request that a substitute judge be named was sufficient where
petitioner had entered a plea of guilty before the respondent judge who
then imposed sentence on the petitioner and on appeal petitioner's guilty plea
was vacated but on remand the case was again assigned to the respondent judge.

Severance is to be based upon a finding of prejudice

   <P></P>
   <T>Where two are indicted jointly, and there is evidence not

    <B>Matter of severance left to discretion of trial court.</B>
Where there was no claim that the joint trial involved evidence

People v. Johnson, 192 Colo. 483, 560 P.2d 465 (1977).</T>
   <P></P>
   <T>The granting or denial of a motion for severance and continuance is a matter

   <T>A motion for severance of defendants is addressed to the sound discretion

People v. Manners, 713 P.2d 1348 (Colo. App. 1985).</T>
   <P></P>
   <T>Although court properly denied motion for severance on evidentiary
grounds, it was an abuse of discretion to deny motion for severance on speedy
trial grounds under § 18-1-405 where court made no finding of good cause

required by § 18-1-405 (6)(c). People v. Hernandez, 829 P.2d 392 (Colo.
App. 1991).</T>

   <P></P>
   <T>
    <B>To determine whether separate trials are required, a trial court must
determine whether admitted evidence is so inherently prejudicial that the
jury would not be able to limit its use to its proper purpose.</B>
Otherwise, a motion for joinder is addressed to the discretion
of the trial court, and will be affirmed absent a showing of
an abuse of discretion and actual prejudice to the moving party.
People v. Escano, 843 P.2d 111 (Colo. App. 1992).</T>
   <P></P>
   <T>
    <B>When an out-of-court statement of a co-defendant does not make
reference to the co-defendant, severance should be granted only when it
is necessary to promote a fair determination of the guilt or innocence of
one or more defendants.</B>
The court should make this determination by considering, among other factors,
whether, in view of the number of offenses and defendants charged and the
complexity of the evidence offered, the trier of fact will be able to
distinguish the evidence and apply the law intelligently as to each
offense and as to each defendant.
People v. Escano, 843 P.2d 111 (Colo. App. 1992).</T>
   <P></P>
   <T>
    <B>Since a co-defendant's statements to the police, made in defendant's
presence, are admissible against defendant, defendant is not entitled to
severance as a matter of right under this section.</B> People v. Gardenhire,

   <P></P>
   <T>
    <B>Trial court did not abuse its discretion by failing to sever defendant's

exercise additional peremptory challenges. People v. Lesney, 855 P.2d 1364
(Colo. 1993).</T>
   <P></P>
   <T>
    <B>Two-part test for determining severance issues.</B> This section
contemplates
a two-part test for determining severance issues: (1) Whether there is
material evidence admissible against one but not all of the parties; and
(2) whether admission of that evidence would be prejudicial against whom
the evidence is not admissible. People v. Gonzales, 198 Colo. 450, 601
P.2d 1366 (1979); People v. Hernandez, 829 P.2d 392 (Colo. App.
1991); People v. Escano, 843 P.2d 111 (Colo. App. 1992).</T>

    <B>Showing required to establish abuse of discretion.</B>
To establish abuse of the trial court's discretion, more is required than a
showing that separate trials might afford a better chance of acquittal.

701 P.2d 17 (Colo. 1985).</T>
   <P></P>
   <T>Mutual participation of defendants in an offense
is considered a logical basis for refusing to sever.
People v. Adams, 678 P.2d 572 (Colo. App. 1984);
People v. Carrillo, 946 P.2d 544 (Colo. App. 1997),
aff'd on other grounds, 974 P.2d 478 (Colo. 1999).</T>
   <P></P>
   <T>Factors to be considered in determining whether denial of severance
constitutes an abuse of discretion include:
(1) whether the number of defendants or the complexity of the evidence
is such that the jury will probably confuse the law and evidence
applicable to each defendant;
(2) whether, despite admonitory instructions, evidence
admissible against one defendant will improperly be considered
against another; and
(3) whether the defenses presented are antagonistic.
People v. Escano, 843 P.2d 111 (Colo. App. 1992);
People v. Carrillo, 946 P.2d 544 (Colo. App. 1997),

   <P></P>
   <T>
    <B>Admission of testimony of codefendant not reversible error.</B>
It was not reversible error to admit evidence concerning a
description of defendants just because it was testimony of a
codefendant as to whom the severance had been granted. In view
of the inconclusive nature of the identification, it cannot
be said that there was any prejudice to the defendants
from the admission of this evidence, although it would
clearly be a better procedure to conceal the source of the
extrajudicial identifications. Kurtz v. People, 177 Colo. 306,
494 P.2d 97 (1972).</T>

  </AN-DIV>
  <ANNO-TEXT>
   <T>
    <B>Considerations in deciding motion for severance.</B> When deciding whether
to grant a motion for severance, the trial court should consider whether
evidence inadmissible against one defendant will be considered against the
other defendant, despite the issuance by the trial court of the proper admonitory
instructions. An additional consideration is whether the defendants plan
to offer antagonistic defenses. People v. Gonzales, 198 Colo. 450, 601
P.2d 1366 (1979).</T>
   <P></P>
   <T>Additional criteria for consideration in determining whether
the possibility of prejudice and unfair trial will result if
severance is denied is whether the number of defendants or the
complexity of evidence, together with the applicable law, will
be confused by the jury, as it applies the law to each defendant.
People v. Warren, 196 Colo. 75, 582 P.2d 663 (1978).</T>
   <P></P>
   <T>Criteria applied in People v. Vigil, 678 P.2d 554 (Colo. App. 1983);
People v. Backus, 952 P.2d 846 (Colo. App. 1998).</T>
   <P></P>
   <T>
    <B>Motion should set out the alleged incompetent
evidence.</B> That a defendant will be prejudiced on a
joint trial by the admission of evidence which is not
admissible as against him but which is competent as
against his codefendant must be made to appear in
support of a motion for a severance, not by merely
stating that evidence will be admitted which is not
competent as against the moving defendant, but the
evidence which it is claimed is incompetent must be
set out so that the court will be given the opportunity
to determine whether or not the defendant moving for a
severance may be prejudiced. Such has been the
recognized practice in this jurisdiction. Davis v. People,
22 Colo. 1, 43 P. 122 (1895); Moore v. People, 31 Colo.
336, 73 P. 30 (1903); Robinson v. People, 76 Colo. 416,
232 P. 672 (1925).</T>
   <P></P>
   <T>Under the provisions of this section it is held that
the showing in support of a motion for a severance was not
sufficient to make the denial of the motion prejudicial
error. The alleged incompetent evidence should be set
out in the motion. Robinson v. People, 76 Colo. 416, 232 P.
672 (1925).</T>
   <P></P>
   <T>The trial court is to be guided by the contents of the
motion and the affidavit and must be advised thereby as to
the nature of the evidence before it can determine whether the
severance should be granted. Where neither the motion, nor
the required affidavit, shows sufficient cause, the trial
court commits no error in denying the motion for severance.
Russell v. People, 125 Colo. 290, 242 P.2d 610 (1952).</T>
   <P></P>
   <T>
    <B>Unless it is impossible to set forth the evidence required.</B>
While a motion for severance should set forth the evidence which
it is claimed will prejudice the rights of the moving defendant,
if it is impossible for him to set out such evidence, the motion
will not be held insufficient because of his failure to do the
impossible. Kolkman v. People, 89 Colo. 8, 300 P. 575 (1931).</T>
   <P></P>
   <T>
    <B>The application for severance must be supported by an
affidavit</B> which definitely shows a good cause therefor.
Robinson v. People, 76 Colo. 416, 232 P. 672 (1925).</T>
   <P></P>
   <T>
    <B>Otherwise the motion is denied.</B> A motion for a separate
trial which contained no statement of facts from which the court
could determine whether there was evidence against a codefendant
which was immaterial and inadmissible as to the moving defendant
and which would be prejudicial if admitted, and the motion
being unverified, not supported by affidavit, and not referring
to any source from which the facts might be obtained, held
properly denied. Garcia v. People, 88 Colo. 267, 295 P. 491 (1931).</T>

   <P></P>
   <T>
    <B>Motion denied where evidence was not within prohibition.</B>
Where evidence of which defendants' counsel complained was not
within the prohibitions of this section, overruling of motion
for separate trials did not constitute prejudicial error. Lewis

   <T>
    <B>Denial of motion upheld where no objection is made to
evidence during trial.</B> Where a motion for severance under
this section was denied, and on the trial no objection was
made on behalf of either defendant to any evidence which
could by any possibility be considered as admissible against
one and inadmissible against the other, the ruling of the
court in denying the motion is upheld. Stone v. People,

   <P></P>
   <T>
    <B>Or where evidence is not prejudicial.</B> Unless the appeal
discloses the admission of prejudicial evidence, no error is

    <B>Refusal to grant severance on proper motion is error.</B> A

    <B>Annotator's note.</B> Since § 16-7-205 is similar to
repealed § 39-7-5, CRS 53, CSA, C. 48, § 479, and laws
antecedent thereto, relevant cases construing those provisions
have been included in the annotations to this section.</T>
   <P></P>
   <T>
    <B>Entry of plea by counsel for defendant is sufficient.</B>
Davis v. People, 77 Colo. 546, 238 P. 25 (1925).</T>
   <P></P>
   <T>When the essential presence of an accused in a court having
jurisdiction is a fulfilled condition, there is no express
requirement in the federal law that in pleading to an indictment
he must actually speak for himself or remain mute in order that
a valid plea may be entered. Marler v. People, 139 Colo. 23,
336 P.2d 101 (1959).</T>
   <P></P>
   <T>
    <B>Declaration of plea may be made orally, by defendant
or counsel.</B> Minich v. People, 8 Colo. 440, 9 P. 4 (1885);
Boyd v. People, 108 Colo. 289, 116 P.2d 193 (1941); Marler
v. People, 139 Colo. 23, 336 P.2d 101 (1959).</T>
   <P></P>
   <T>
    <B>But plea must be entered in open court.</B> A message from
counsel for defendant to the prosecuting attorney, authorizing
the entry of a plea, does not authorize the acceptance of such
a plea. Whether by defendant or his counsel, the plea must be
entered orally and in open court. Boyd v. People, 108 Colo.
289, 116 P.2d 193 (1941).</T>
   <P></P>
   <T>
    <B>Withdrawal of plea is not a matter of right.</B> In the
absence of statute or of peculiar circumstances, a defendant
in a criminal case is not entitled as a matter of right to
withdraw a plea duly made to an indictment or information,
in order that he may file another plea or interpose objections
to the proceedings which should have been presented before
the plea; hence the action of a trial court in refusing a
change of plea will not be reversed if there is no abuse
of discretion. Abshier v. People, 87 Colo. 507, 289 P.
1081 (1930).</T>
   <P></P>
   <T>Where a defendant in a criminal case is arraigned and enters
pleas of not guilty and not guilty by reason of insanity, he does
not thereafter have an absolute right to withdraw those pleas
and enter a plea of guilty in order to avoid prosecution upon
another information which includes habitual criminal counts.
Matz v. People, 133 Colo. 45, 291 P.2d 1059 (1956).</T>
   <P></P>
   <T>Defendants cannot withdraw consent which was freely given
simply because the sentence which the court imposes is not to
their liking. Williams v. People, 134 Colo. 580, 307 P.2d
466 (1957).</T>
   <P></P>
   <T>
    <B>Application to change a plea is addressed to the sound
discretion of the court,</B> and its ruling will be reversed
only for an abuse of that discretion, resulting in direct
prejudice to the defendant whose application is denied.
Matz v. People, 133 Colo. 45, 291 P.2d 1059 (1956).</T>
   <P></P>
   <T>
    <B>No abuse of discretion in refusing defendant permission to change plea.</B>
A trial court did not abuse its discretion in refusing to grant the defendant
permission to withdraw his plea of nolo contendere and to reinstate a plea
of not guilty. People v. Canino, 181 Colo. 207,
508 P.2d 1273 (1973).</T>
   <P></P>
   <T>
    <B>Nolo contendere plea should be upheld.</B>
Nolo contendere plea that is voluntarily and understandingly made,
with a factual basis that appears in the record, should be upheld.
People v. Canino, 181 Colo. 207,
508 P.2d 1273 (1973).</T>

    <B>Annotator's note.</B> Since § 16-7-206 is similar to

§ 39-7-8, CRS 53, and CSA, C. 48, § 482, relevant cases
construing those provisions have been included in the
annotations to this section.</T>
   <P></P>
   <T>
    <B>This section is mandatory.</B> The provisions of this section
dealing with arraignment, advice of counsel, and warning as to
consequences of the guilty plea are mandatory and a prerequisite
under due process. Vanderhoof v. People, 152 Colo. 147, 380 P.2d
903 (1963).</T>
   <P></P>
   <T>This section deals with certain procedures that are to be
followed by trial courts where the accused enters a plea of
guilty. Burbach v. Tinsley, 143 Colo. 449, 354 P.2d 170 (1960).</T>
   <P></P>
   <T>
    <B>It satisfies requirements of due process.</B> Compliance
with this section, provisions for the appointment of counsel
for indigent defendants, and §§ 16 and 25 of art. II, Colo. Const.,
satisfies the due process requirement
of the fourteenth amendment to the United States Constitution. Santo
v. Santo, 120 Colo. 13, 206 P.2d 341 (1949).</T>
   <P></P>
   <T>
    <B>And failure to comply would render sentence void.</B> If a
prisoner pleading guilty is entitled to preliminary safeguards,
including warning as to the consequences of the plea, and is
not told that he may be imprisoned for life, the life
sentence would be void. Vanderhoof v. People, 152 Colo. 147,
380 P.2d 903 (1963).</T>
   <P></P>
   <T>
    <B>Court may refuse to accept guilty plea.</B> In some circumstances
a trial court, in the protection of an accused, might well refuse to
accept a tendered plea of guilty, while in other circumstances
protection of the interests of the people might demand similar
action. Matz v. People, 133 Colo. 45, 291 P.2d 1059 (1956).</T>
   <P></P>
   <T>
    <B>Defendants are in jeopardy upon acceptance of guilty plea.</B> Where
defendants plead guilty to a charge of robbery, which pleas are accepted,
and evidence produced for the purpose of enlightening a court prior
to sentence is found to be insufficient to sustain the charge,
whereupon the court orders the information dismissed and the defendants
discharged, whether such orders are right or wrong, the defendants are
in jeopardy. Markiewicz v. Black, 138 Colo. 128, 330 P.2d 539 (1958).</T>
   <P></P>
   <T>
    <B>Constitutional requirements for valid plea of guilty.</B>
The constitution requires that the defendant be aware of the elements
of the offense and that he voluntarily and understandingly acknowledge
his guilt when pleading guilty. People v. Canino, 181 Colo. 207,
508 P.2d 1273 (1973).</T>
   <P></P>
   <T>Rather than ritualistic compliance, the constitution requires only
that a defendant pleading guilty be aware of the elements of the
offense and that he voluntarily and understandingly acknowledge his guilt.
People v. Duran, 183 Colo. 180,
515 P.2d 1117 (1973).</T>
   <P></P>
   <T>A plea of guilty should not be set aside if a factual basis exists
for the plea and if the defendant has knowledge of the elements of the crime
and enters the plea voluntarily. People v. Hutton, 183 Colo. 388,
517 P.2d 392 (1973).</T>
   <P></P>
   <T>A defendant must be made aware of the elements of the crime with which
he is charged before a guilty plea may be accepted. People v. Musser, 187 Colo. 198,
529 P.2d 626 (1974).</T>
   <P></P>
   <T>
    <B>A plea of guilty, to be valid, must be intelligently made.</B> If
there is any question, the trial court has the duty to determine the
defendant's mental capacity to understand the nature and effect of such
a plea before accepting it. Hampton v. Tinsley, 240 F. Supp. 213
(D. Colo. 1965), rev'd on other grounds, 355 F.2d 470 (10th Cir. 1966).</T>
   <P></P>
   <T>For a waiver of a fundamental right to be valid, the defendant
must voluntarily, knowingly, and intentionally relinquish that
right. People v. Harrington, 179 Colo. 312, 500 P.2d 360 (1972).</T>
   <P></P>
   <T>
    <B>A guilty plea cannot stand if it lacks a factual basis and is not
voluntary and accurate.</B> People v. Alvarez, 181 Colo. 213,
508 P.2d 1267 (1973).</T>
   <P></P>
   <T>
    <B>Plea of guilty is clearly involuntary if it is induced by threats</B>
or by a promise of lenient sentence. People v. McClellan, 183 Colo. 176,
515 P.2d 1127 (1973).</T>
   <P></P>
   <T>If a plea of guilty results from plea bargaining and the bargain is not
honored, the judgment must be vacated. People v. McClellan, 183 Colo. 176,
515 P.2d 1127 (1973).</T>
   <P></P>
   <T>
    <B>A plea of guilty by one who is insane is a nullity.</B>
Hampton v. Tinsley, 240 F. Supp. 213 (D. Colo. 1965), rev'd
on other grounds, 355 F.2d 470 (10th Cir. 1966).</T>
   <P></P>
   <T>
    <B>Prior to Boykin v. Alabama (395 U.S. 238, 89 S. Ct. 1709,
23 L. Ed. 2d 274 (1969)) there was no prescribed ritual</B>
to be performed to satisfy the court that the defendant understood
the nature of the charge when pleading guilty.
People v. Moore, 185 Colo. 54, 521 P.2d 768 (1974).</T>
   <P></P>
   <T>
    <B>Since Boykin v. Alabama, courts must put finding of voluntariness on
record.</B>
People v. Gutierrez, 182 Colo. 55,
511 P.2d 20 (1973).</T>
   <P></P>
   <T>
    <B>A valid plea of guilty waives substantially all the
fundamental procedural rights</B> afforded the accused in a
criminal proceeding such as his rights to the assistance
of counsel, confrontation of witnesses, and trial by jury.
People v. Harrington, 179 Colo. 312, 500 P.2d 360 (1972).</T>
   <P></P>
   <T>
    <B>A guilty plea does not waive a valid double jeopardy claim of being punished
twice for the same offense.</B> People v. Gardner, 250 P.3d 1262 (Colo. App. 2010).</T>
   <P></P>
   <T>
    <B>A guilty plea waives an as-applied equal protection claim to the constitutionality
of a statute.</B> People v. Gardner, 250 P.3d 1262 (Colo. App. 2010).</T>
   <P></P>
   <T>
    <B>Waiver must affirmatively appear.</B> Every reasonable
presumption against waiver must be indulged, and the record
must affirmatively show that the accused understandingly and
voluntarily waived the constitutional right which is in
issue by a plea of guilty. People v. Harrington, 179 Colo. 312,
500 P.2d 360 (1972).</T>
   <P></P>
   <T>
    <B>And burden on accused to attack such waiver.</B> If there
is some showing of an affirmative waiver, the burden of proof
rests with the defendant to show by a preponderance of the
evidence that his apparent waiver was not effective. People
v. Harrington, 179 Colo. 312, 500 P.2d 360 (1972).</T>
   <P></P>
   <T>
    <B>Plea of guilty entered by counsel valid.</B> If an indicted
person is actually present in open court with his attorney who
is competent to represent him and does so under circumstances
which fairly show that the attorney speaks for his client who
understands what is being done and its import and who acquiesces
when the attorney enters a plea of guilty for him, should
have exactly the same force and effect as though he had spoken
himself in the words of the attorney. Marler v. People, 139 Colo.
23, 336 P.2d 101 (1959).</T>
   <P></P>
   <T>
    <B>Uncertainty as to whether evidence was sufficiently direct
to warrant death penalty does not mean guilty plea was unintelligently
made</B> and invalid and attorneys had a reasonable foundation for
advising that the death penalty was a real possibility prompting
petitioner's guilty plea. Scheer v. Patterson, 429 F.2d 907 (10th
Cir. 1970), cert. denied, 400 U.S. 996, 91 S. Ct. 471, 27 L. Ed. 2d 445 (1971).</T>
   <P></P>
   <T>
    <B>Evidentiary hearing on failure to advise possible
penalties not required.</B> Where trial court in providency
hearing advises petitioner of possible sentence term, and
sentences imposed were within that range, and trial court
did not treat either offense as a second offense, evidentiary
hearing on petitioner's contention that sentencing court
failed to properly inform him of the possible penalties
for crimes to which he entered guilty plea is not required.
Hyde v. Hinton, 180 Colo. 324, 505 P.2d 376 (1973).</T>
   <P></P>
   <T>
    <B>Formalistic recitation by the trial judge at a providency
hearing is not a constitutional requisite.</B> People v. Canino,
181 Colo. 207, 508 P.2d 1273 (1973).</T>
   <P></P>
   <T>
    <B>Right of defendant held sufficiently protected.</B> The right
of defendant to be advised concerning the consequences of his pleas
of guilty which pleas resulted in a life sentence under the
habitual criminal statute, held sufficiently protected. Glass
v. People, 127 Colo. 210, 255 P.2d 738 (1953).</T>
   <P></P>
   <T>
    <B>Failure to determine plea was made intelligently denied
due process.</B> In a criminal case where a defendant was unable
at the time of his guilty plea to remember the details of the
offense and where since its commission he has been subconsciously
unable to remember these details until a relatively recent date,
the failure of the judge at the trial to consider whether
accused was insane at the time and could thus enter a plea of
guilty intelligently constituted a violation of procedural,
if not substantive, due process. Hampton v. Tinsley, 240
F. Supp. 213 (D. Colo. 1965), rev'd on other grounds,
355 F.2d 470 (10th Cir. 1966).</T>
   <P></P>
   <T>
    <B>A guilty plea under subsection (3) constitutes a conviction, even if subsequently
dismissed under a deferred judgment,</B> for purposes of determining whether the case
can be sealed pursuant to § 24-72-308. M.T. v. People, 275 P.3d 661 (Colo. App.
2010),
aff'd, 2012 CO 11, 269 P.3d 1219.</T>
   <P></P>
   <T>
    <B>Conviction by guilty plea may be used for impeachment purposes.</B>
Acceptance by a court of a guilty plea, pursuant to subsection (3), may
be equated to a jury verdict which has been sustained following a motion
for a new trial, and, even if the defendant is never sentenced following
that guilty plea, that conviction may be used for impeachment purposes should
the defendant testify at a later trial. People v. Baca, 44 Colo. App. 167,
610 P.2d 1083 (1980).</T>
   <P></P>
   <T>
    <B>Plea to misdemeanor or traffic offense.</B>
Before accepting a plea of guilty or nolo contendere to a misdemeanor or
traffic offense, the trial court must be satisfied that the defendant's
decision to acknowledge guilt has been made knowingly and understandingly.
People v. Lesh, 668 P.2d 1362 (Colo. 1983).</T>
   <P></P>
   <T>
    <B>Guilty plea entered voluntarily.</B> People
v. Musser, 187 Colo. 198, 529 P.2d 626 (1974).</T>
   <P></P>
   <T>
    <B>Although a guilty plea under subsection (3) acts as a conviction, the
conviction process is incomplete until the entry of a judgment of conviction
under Crim. P. 32(c).</B> People v. Wiedemer, 899 P.2d 283 (Colo. App. 1994).</T>
   <P></P>
   <T>
    <B>Conditional guilty pleas are not authorized in Colorado by statute or court
rule.</B> People v. Neuhaus, 240 P.3d 391 (Colo. App. 2009), aff'd, 2012 CO 65, 289
P.3d
19; People v. Hoffman, 2012 CO 66, 289 P.3d 24; Escobedo v. People, 2012 CO 67, 289

    <B>Defendant who pleads guilty may not bring an as-applied equal protection
postconviction challenge.</B> People v. Ford, 232 P.3d 260 (Colo. App. 2009).</T>
   <P></P>
   <T>
    <B>Penalty advisement required by subsection (1)(a) does not apply to deferred
judgment revocations.</B> The deferred judgment revocation statute incorporates this
section
only insofar as those matters that are applicable. Since the revocation complaint alleges a
violation of the deferred judgment agreement and not a new crime, the penalty
advisement for a new criminal offense does not apply. Finney v. People, 2014 CO 38,

    <B>This section and Crim. P. 11(b) require that a
trial court must make certain determinations before it accepts
a plea</B> of guilty or a plea of nolo contendere. People v.
Lambert, 189 Colo. 264, 539 P.2d 1238 (1975).</T>
   <P></P>
   <T>
    <B>In pleading guilty, defendant must be adequately advised</B> of nature and

suffice. Wilson v. People, 708 P.2d 792 (Colo. 1985).</T>
   <P></P>
   <T>
    <B>If the trial judge doubted the credibility of the charge,</B>
even though a factual basis for the guilty plea existed,
his duty was to vacate the guilty plea, enter a plea of not

351, 553 P.2d 73 (1976).</T>
   <P></P>
   <T>
    <B>No set ritual.</B> The overriding consideration in analyzing
a record pertaining to a guilty plea or a plea of nolo contendere

   <T>
    <B>Or precise language in record.</B> If the record reflects
that the trial court had assured itself that defendant's plea
was voluntary and intelligently entered with full knowledge of
the nature and elements of the offense and of the waiver of his
rights as an accused person, then lack of precise language in
the record expressing these things is not of itself a valid
reason to reverse acceptance of a plea of nolo contendere.

   <T>
    <B>Full compliance would reduce challenges.</B> The
failure of a trial judge to make certain that the record
expressly reflects full compliance with this section and
Crim. P. 11 before he accepts a plea of guilty or
a plea of nolo contendere frequently generates a challenge.
Full compliance would certainly diminish challenges and
appeals. People v. Lambert, 189 Colo. 264, 539 P.2d 1238 (1975).</T>

    <B>Duty to comply with Crim. P. 32(e).</B> The
provision in Crim. P. 11(b)(5) and subsection (2)(e), that the court will not be bound
by representations
made to the defendant "unless the representations are included in a formal
plea agreement approved by the court and supported by the findings
of the presentence report ...", does not free the court from complying
with Crim. P. 32(e), which requires that if the court decides that
the final disposition should not include the charge or sentence
concessions contemplated by a plea agreement, as provided in
Crim. P. 11(f), it shall so advise the defendant and then call on the
defendant to either affirm or withdraw his plea of guilty or
nolo contendere. People v. Wright, 38 Colo. App. 271, 559 P.2d

   <P></P>
   <T>Merely informing the defendant that the court will not be

   <P></P>
   <T>
    <B>Authority to vacate guilty plea.</B> Although a trial judge's
authority to dismiss a criminal charge on his own motion prior to
trial, except as expressly authorized by statute or rule, is narrowly
limited, a trial court does have the authority to vacate a guilty
plea and enter a not guilty plea if the charges were not supported
by facts appearing in the record of all court appearances and in
the presentencing report.
People v. Carino, 193 Colo. 412, 566 P.2d 1061 (1977).</T>
   <P></P>
   <T>
    <B>A trial court is not generally required to inform a defendant of the
collateral consequences of his guilty plea.</B> People v. Moore, 841 P.2d 320
(Colo. App. 1992); People v. Jones, 957 P.2d 1046 (Colo. App. 1997).</T>
   <P></P>
   <T>To satisfy due process, a defendant must be informed only of the direct
consequences of his guilty plea, which include those which have a definite,
immediate, and largely automatic effect on the range of possible punishment.
People v. Moore, 841 P.2d 320 (Colo. App. 1992);
People v. Jones, 957 P.2d 1046 (Colo. App. 1997).</T>

   <T>Accordingly, a guilty plea is not invalid for failure of a trial court to
warn a defendant of its possible effect on future criminal liability. People

    <B>Court authorized to enter plea of not guilty only.</B>
Where defendant, on being arraigned, stood mute, the court
was without authority to enter a plea of "not guilty by
reason of insanity at the time of the commission of the
crime and since". The only plea that the court, under
the circumstances, could properly enter for defendant
was a plea of "not guilty". Boyd v. People, 108 Colo. 289,

   <P></P>
   <T>
    <B>Proceedings valid where defendant did not object to omission of
plea.</B> Where defendant proceeded to trial without objection and
contested the action as though a not guilty plea had been entered,
and the fact that no such plea had been entered was not mentioned
or called to the trial court's attention in the motion for a new
trial, such omission did not render proceedings void and
defendant is entitled to no relief by reason thereof. Landford
v. People, 148 Colo. 300, 365 P.2d 893 (1961), cert. denied,

   <P></P>
   <T>Where defendant proceeded to trial without objection and
in all respects contested the case as though the "not guilty"
plea had been entered, the defendant was not prejudiced by this
procedural omission. The error or omission is called to the
attention of the trial court by the appeal, and the entry of a
plea of not guilty will suffice. Romero v. People, 170

    <B>When a defendant enters into a plea agreement that includes as a

plea agreement for a reduced sentence if a district attorney's polygraphist determined that
the defendant was telling the truth. Defendant then refused to disclose the results of
earlier polygraph tests administered by a defense polygraphist. DA's polygraphist
testified that it was necessary for him to review the results of those tests before offering
an opinion as to the truthfulness of the defendant's story. The court could not order the
defendant to turnover the results of the earlier polygraph tests, but, if he did not do so,
the

probative effect on the issue of guilt or innocence, for
both parties then assumed that a guilty plea would be entered,
when the defendant did withdraw from the plea negotiations,
thus aborting the only purpose for which his
inculpatory statements had been given, it was palpably
unfair to allow the prosecution to use those statements
against him for an entirely unintended purpose to prove his
guilt. Gelfand v. People, 196 Colo. 487,

    <B>Annotator's note.</B>
Since § 16-8-101 is similar to repealed § 39-8-1, C.R.S. 1963, and
§ 39-8-1, CRS 53, relevant cases construing those provisions
have been included in the annotations to this section.</T>
   <P></P>
   <T>
    <B>Test of criminal responsibility is policy of general assembly.</B> The kind and
character
of test
and the extent of the category of recognized criminal irresponsibility are questions of
policy
which
are
properly within the province of the general assembly. Castro v. People, 140 Colo. 493,
346
P.2d
1020 (1959).</T>
   <P></P>
   <T>
    <B>Constitutionality.</B> The right and wrong and irresistible impulse tests
described
by
this
section are valid. Early v. People, 142 Colo. 462, 352 P.2d 112, cert. denied, 364 U.S.
847,
81
S. Ct. 90, 5 L. Ed. 2d 70 (1960).</T>
   <P></P>
   <T>The test of insanity prescribed by this section is not so uncertain, ambiguous, and
unintelligible as to constitute a deprivation of due process of law. Castro v. People,
140 Colo. 493, 346 P.2d 1020 (1959).</T>
   <P></P>
   <T>
    <B>This section has adopted the M'Naghten right and wrong test and the irresistible
impulse
test.</B> Thus a person is held to be insane as far as the criminal laws are concerned
when
he is
so diseased in mind as to be incapable of distinguishing right from wrong or where he
suffers
such an impairment of mind as to render him incapable of choosing the right and
refraining
from
doing the wrong. Castro v. People, 140 Colo. 493, 346 P.2d 1020 (1959).</T>
   <P></P>
   <T>
    <B>Rationale for excusing from criminal responsibility.</B>
A person who is criminally insane is excused from criminal responsibility for his actions
because,
due to a mental disease or defect, he lacks
the capacity to distinguish right from wrong with respect
to the act or to adhere to the right or refrain from the wrong. Hendershott v. People, 653
P.2d
385 (Colo. 1982), cert. denied, 459 U.S. 1225,
103 S. Ct. 1232, 75 L. Ed. 2d 466 (1983).</T>
   <P></P>
   <T>
    <B>Section does not address defendant's ability to form particular mental
state.</B> This section's definition addresses the issue of whether the defendant
has sufficient mental capacity to be held accountable for any crimes he
may have committed. It does not answer the question of whether the defendant
was capable of forming a particular mental state required for a conviction
of the substantive charge. People v. Morgan, 637 P.2d 338 (Colo. 1981).</T>
   <P></P>
   <T>
    <B>An insane defendant can be found guilty of a crime,</B>
provided he was not insane at the time of the offenses charged.
People v. Gillings, 39 Colo. App. 387, 568 P.2d 92 (1977).</T>
   <P></P>
   <T>
    <B>Trial court did not err</B> in precluding expert witness
from offering an opinion as to whether defendant was legally
insane in 1981 where the single issue to be determined by the
jury was defendant's legal sanity or insanity at the time of the
killing in 1983. People v. Galimanis, 944 P.2d 626 (Colo. App.
1997).</T>
   <P></P>
   <T>
    <B>Trial court did not improperly exclude evidence of specific
instances of defendant's conduct that occurred during defendant's
confinement at state hospital in the months subsequent to the
killing</B> for which the defendant was on trial. People v.
Galimanis, 944 P.2d 626 (Colo. App. 1997).</T>
   <P></P>
   <T>
    <B>Different standard for competence to stand trial.</B> A criminal defendant who
raises
the sanity issue is constitutionally entitled to a separate hearing to determine his
competence
to stand trial because a different standard determines competence to stand trial from that
which
determines the validity of a defense of not guilty by reason of insanity. Parks v. Denver
District Court, 180 Colo. 202, 503 P.2d 1029 (1972).</T>
   <P></P>
   <T>
    <B>Insanity tests under this section and § 16-8-120 different.</B>
The general assembly has chosen by enactment of this section and § 16-8-120
to distinguish between the test in a criminal case for a verdict of not guilty
by reason of insanity and the test for release from a mental institution
once it is suggested that commitment might safely be terminated.
People v. Lyles, 186 Colo. 302,
526 P.2d 1332 (1974).</T>
   <P></P>
   <T>
    <B>And defendant was not denied due process</B> by failure
to apply as the standard for release the same test applied to determine whether
he was insane several years earlier when the alleged crime
was committed. People v. Giles, 192 Colo. 240,
557 P.2d 408 (1976).</T>
   <P></P>
   <T>
    <B>Where defendant was insane at the time of his escape, he should not be held
accountable for his escape</B> so as to forfeit good time earned prior thereto,
or be held subject to the sanctions of § 17-1-207 (2) (as that section
existed prior to the repeal and reenactment of title 17 in 1977), by which he was
ordered by the administrative adjustment committee to serve at least two calendar
years from and after his administrative transfer to the prison, without the opportunity
to earn good time during this two-year period. It would be an anomaly that
the defendant, by reason of his legal insanity and unaccountability, could
not have been convicted of a felonious escape under § 18-8-208,
whereas he could be held accountable for his escape and be subject to the
statutory sanctions resulting therefrom, in spite of his insanity and
unaccountability. Lange v. Schauer, 184 Colo. 373,
520 P.2d 753 (1974).</T>
   <P></P>
   <T>
    <B>A court cannot find one sane who had previously been found
insane unless</B> he is first "released from commitment" pursuant to law.
People v. Gillings, 39 Colo. App. 387, 568 P.2d 92 (1977).</T>
   <P></P>
   <T>A person found insane as to one time cannot be held to be sane
at a subsequent time unless and until there is compliance with the
statutory mandates relating to release from commitment.
People v. Gillings, 39 Colo. App. 387, 568 P.2d 92 (1977).</T>
   <P></P>
   <T>
    <B>Insanity adjudication results in a presumptive continuation of a state of mental
incapacity</B> until it is shown that sanity has been restored.
People v. Giles, 662 P.2d 1073 (Colo. 1983).</T>
   <P></P>
   <T>
    <B>But committed person not incapable of committing crimes.</B>
An insanity adjudication represents a judicial determination that an accused is not legally
responsible for a past criminal act by reason of a
mental disease or defect which existed at the time the
act was committed. It is simply not true, however, that an insanity adjudication renders a
committed person legally incapable of committing
future crimes during the period of commitment.
People v. Giles, 662 P.2d 1073 (Colo. 1983).</T>
   <P></P>
   <T>
    <B>While a finding of insanity as to one time is binding on
the courts,</B> such a finding does not mandate a finding of
insanity as to an earlier time period.
People v. Gillings, 39 Colo. App. 387, 568 P.2d 92 (1977).</T>
   <P></P>
   <T>
    <B>Finding of sanity as to one act does not preclude different finding as
to another act.</B>
Where acts are separated by time and location, a finding of sanity as to
one act would not preclude a different finding as to the later ones.
People v. Beasley, 43 Colo. App. 488, 608 P.2d 835 (1979).</T>
   <P></P>
   <T>
    <B>The distinction between insanity and incompetency must
be sharply drawn.</B> Incompetency merely abates the action and
is procedural in effect, while insanity is substantive and renders
the defendant not guilty.
People v. Gillings, 39 Colo. App. 387, 568 P.2d 92 (1977).</T>
   <P></P>
   <T>Insane persons are, under the law, not necessarily incompetent
to stand trial because of the fact of their insanity, while, in
contrast, an incompetent defendant may not be tried.
People v. Gillings, 39 Colo. App. 387, 568 P.2d 92 (1977).</T>
   <P></P>
   <T>Although a person may be both insane and incompetent,
likewise, one may be insane and yet competent to stand trial.
People v. Gillings, 39 Colo. App. 387, 568 P.2d 92 (1977).</T>
   <P></P>
   <T>
    <B>A person adjudicated not guilty by reason of insanity as defined in this section
and § 16-8-101.5 is not a handicapped individual</B> under § 504 of the
Rehabilitation Act of 1973. Neiberger v. Hawkins, 239 F. Supp. 2d 1140 (D. Colo.
2002).</T>
   <P></P>
   <T>
    <B>The "deific-decree" delusion is recognized in Colorado;</B> a defendant may
be judged legally insane if the defendant's cognitive ability to distinguish
right from wrong with respect to the act has been destroyed as a result
of a psychotic delusion that God has decreed the act. People v. Serravo,
823 P.2d 128 (Colo. 1992).</T>
   <P></P>
   <T>
    <B>But the trial court did not err in refusing to submit an instruction specifying that
a
"deific-decree" delusion could constitute legal insanity</B> where the court instead
submitted an instruction explaining that the term "incapable of distinguishing right from
wrong" refers to cognitive inability, due to mental disease or defect, to distinguish right
from
wrong as measured by a societal standard of morality, even though the person may be
aware
that the conduct in question is criminal. People v. Tally, 7 P.3d 172 (Colo. App. 1999).</T>
   <P></P>
   <T>
    <B>Trial court did not err in refusing to include as a jury
instruction that a "deific-decree" delusion could constitute
legal insanity</B> where there was no evidence that defendant
felt he was under any compulsion by God to murder the victim.
People v. Galimanis, 944 P.2d 626 (Colo. App. 1997).</T>
   <P></P>
   <T>
    <B>The concepts of "right" and "wrong" are essentially ethical in
character</B>
and have their primary source in the existing societal standards of morality
as distinguished from the written law. But a personal and subjective
standard
of morality should not be permitted to exonerate a defendant. People v.
Serravo, 823 P.2d 128 (Colo. 1992).</T>
   <P></P>
   <T>
    <B>Trial court was not required to submit the clarifying
instruction on the definition of legal insanity specifying that
right from wrong is measured by a societal standard</B> where
defendant did not contend that his actions were justified under
his own moral beliefs or moral code, nor that he was conscious
that what he was doing was right or wrong, either legally or
morally. People v. Galimanis, 944 P.2d 626 (Colo. App. 1997).</T>
   <P></P>
   <T>
    <B>The appropriate construction of the term "incapable of distinguishing
right from wrong"</B> should be measured by existing societal standards of
morality rather than a defendant's personal and subjective understanding
of the legality or illegality of the act in question. People v. Serravo,
823 P.2d 128 (Colo. 1992).</T>
   <P></P>
   <T>
    <B>Res judicata or collateral estoppel do not operate to make a prior
adjudication of insanity into a conclusive presumption of insanity or
incompetence to stand trial</B> for criminal acts which are committed after an
insanity
adjudication but before a formal restoration of the defendant to sanity.
Blehm v. People, 817 P.2d 988 (Colo. 1991).</T>
   <P></P>
   <T>
    <B>When a mental infirmity is directly caused by voluntary intoxication,
even though effects have dissipated, the defendant is not diseased within
legal insanity statute,</B> and, therefore, court was correct in refusing to
issue
jury instruction on settled insanity doctrine. People v. Bieber, 835 P.2d
542 (Colo. App. 1992), aff'd, 856 P.2d 811 (Colo. 1993),
cert. denied, 510 U.S. 1054, 114 S. Ct. 716, 126 L. Ed. 2d 680 (1994).</T>
   <P></P>
   <T>
    <B>Instruction in language of section is proper.</B> No error is committed when
a trial court
submits to the jury an instruction which is drafted substantially in the
language of this section,
and which has been approved by the Colorado supreme court. The words
"depravity" and "obliquity",
while not used in every day conversation, are well within the comprehension of
a jury. Simms v.
People, 174 Colo. 85, 482 P.2d 974 (1971).</T>
   <P></P>
   <T>Jury instruction which set forth the test of insanity in the exact
language of the statute was held to be proper. Salas v. People, 181 Colo. 321,
509 P.2d 586 (1973).</T>
   <P></P>
   <T>
    <B>Trial court is not required to provide an instruction on
the phrase "moral obliquity",</B> as such term is well within the
comprehension of a jury. People v. Galimanis, 944 P.2d 626
(Colo. App. 1997).</T>
   <P></P>
   <T>
    <B>Applied</B> in Johnson v. People, 174 Colo. 413, 484 P.2d 110 (1971);

conforming amendments to sections 16-8-101 to 16-8-104, 16-8-106,
16-8-110, 16-8-114, 16-8-115, and 16-8-120 in 1995, and in

sections 16-8-105 and 16-8-107 and sections 18-1-802 and 18-1-803,
C.R.S., in 1996, was to combine the defense of not guilty by
reason of insanity and the affirmative defense of impaired mental
condition into the affirmative defense of not guilty by reason of
insanity and to create a unitary process for hearing the issues
raised by said affirmative defense to apply to offenses committed
on or after July 1, 1995.</SECTION-TEXT>

    <B>A person adjudicated not guilty by reason of insanity as defined in this section
and § 16-8-101 is not a handicapped individual</B> under § 504 of the
Rehabilitation Act of 1973. Neiberger v. Hawkins, 239 F. Supp. 2d 1140 (D. Colo.
2002).</T>
   <P></P>
   <T>
    <B>Exclusion for voluntary ingestion of intoxicating substances</B> applies to both
prongs of the insanity test. People v. Grant, 174 P.3d 798 (Colo. App. 2007).</T>
   <P></P>
   <T>
    <B>Defendant offered insufficient evidence showing that he was insane or
incompetent to stand trial.</B> Since defendant failed to introduce sufficient evidence
on those issues, the court need not determine whether defendant could offer evidence of
"settled insanity" along with other evidence of his mental condition on the issue of sanity.
People v. Grenier, 200 P.3d 1062 (Colo. App. 2008).</T>
   <P></P>
   <T>
    <B>Trial court properly instructed the jury that "any mental illness suffered by
defendant is not a defense in this case".</B> Defendant's mental illness does not support
the defense of involuntary intoxication since the defense of involuntary intoxication
involves a temporary condition, and bipolar is not a temporary condition. Defendant's
bipolar condition would have provided evidence for an insanity defense, but defendant
did not plead insanity, which requires a special pleading. Therefore, the court properly
instructed the jury that mental illness was not a defense in this case. People v. Sommers,
200 P.3d 1089 (Colo. App. 2008).</T>
   <P></P>
   <T>
    <B>Trial court did not err by finding defendant sane at the time of his offense.</B>
Prosecution presented sufficient evidence from two psychologist expert witnesses that
defendant's behavior was not driven by insanity but by drugs and antisocial behavior.

    <B>The affirmative defense of insanity under this section is available to a defendant
who experiences a temporary or long-term bout of insanity</B> so long as he or she was
legally insane at the time of the alleged crime. People v. Voth, 2013 CO 61, 312 P.3d
144.</T>
   <P></P>
   <T>
    <B>Evidence of defendant's sanity as to one of eleven counts against him was
substantial and sufficient to permit a reasonable juror to find that defendant was
sane.</B> The issue is whether defendant was capable, at the time he committed the acts,
of distinguishing right from wrong with respect to the criminal acts. People v. Eastwood,

    <B>Annotator's note.</B> Since § 16-8-103 is similar to repealed §
39-8-1, C.R.S. 1963,
§ 39-8-1, CRS 53, CSA, C. 48, § 507, and laws antecedent thereto,
relevant cases construing those provisions have
been included in the annotations to this section.</T>
   <P></P>
   <T>
    <B>The affirmative defense of impaired mental condition is separate and
distinct from the defense of insanity;</B> its sole effect is to negate the
existence of an element of the crime charged. However, if a defendant
intends
to raise the defense of impaired mental condition at trial, he must also
specially plead the defense at arraignment. People v. Bolton, 859 P.2d 311
(Colo. App. 1993).</T>
   <P></P>
   <T>
    <B>The purpose of this section</B> is to require the defense of insanity to be
tried only under a
special plea, to require this plea to be interposed at the time of arraignment, and to
require
a
special
verdict on this issue. This defense cannot now be introduced under the plea of "not
guilty",
as it
formerly could be. Ingles v. People, 92 Colo. 518, 22 P.2d 1109 (1933); Mundy v.
People,
105
Colo.
547, 100 P.2d 584 (1940).</T>
   <P></P>
   <T>
    <B>Notwithstanding this section, based upon a criminal defendant's constitutional
right to due process, the defendant's "mental slowness" may be considered as factual
evidence</B> to support the argument that he or she lacked the required culpable mental
state. People v. Vanrees, 125 P.3d 403 (Colo. 2005).</T>
   <P></P>
   <T>
    <B>Constitutionality.</B>
The constitutional provision concerning the inviolability of jury
trials does not prohibit the general assembly from changing the method of raising the
question of
insanity. Nor does the requirement that in order to raise the question of insanity, the
defendant
must plead it in the specified manner, offend against the due process clause of the
constitution.
Ingles v. People, 92 Colo. 518, 22 P.2d 1109 (1933).</T>
   <P></P>
   <T>A statute which requires a special plea to be entered in cases where insanity is relied
on
as
a defense does not deny due process of law. Leick v. People, 131 Colo. 353, 281 P.2d
806
(1955).</T>
   <P></P>
   <T>The requirement that a special plea as to insanity be entered to be followed by a
period
of observation does not deny to a defendant any constitutional right. Robbins v. People,
142
Colo. 254, 350 P.2d 818 (1960).</T>
   <P></P>
   <T>
    <B>Subsection (2) not unconstitutional.</B>
Subsection (2), which provides for the determination of the issue of
defendant's sanity in advance of trial, is not facially unconstitutional.
Les v. Meredith, 193 Colo. 3, 561 P.2d 1256 (1977).</T>
   <P></P>
   <T>Subsection (2) does not offend traditional
notions of fair play and substantial justice. Public
safety and welfare considerations override the reasons assigned
by the trial court for its declaration of unconstitutionality, i.e., that
in violation of §§ 16 and 25 of art. II, Colo. Const., defendant
had lost his right to confront witnesses against him, the right to appear
and defend against the charges made, the right to assert all available defenses,
and the right to a public trial upon the merits of the charges. Les v. Meredith,
193 Colo. 3, 561 P.2d 1256 (1977).</T>
   <P></P>
   <T>The administration of justice is improved if, upon having
reason to do so and after holding a hearing, a trial
judge can enter a plea of not guilty by reason of insanity on
behalf of the defendant, irrespective of the defendant's wishes.
Les v. Meredith, 193 Colo. 3, 561 P.2d 1256 (1977).</T>
   <P></P>
   <T>
    <B>Section only changes the procedure.</B> The substance of the defendant's right
to
a
jury
trial on the question of insanity has been preserved; the procedure only has been
changed.
Ingles v. People, 92 Colo. 518, 22 P.2d 1109 (1933); Mundy v. People, 105 Colo. 547,
100
P.2d
584 (1940).</T>
   <P></P>
   <T>
    <B>And it is to be liberally construed in favor of defendants.</B> Martinez v.
People,
179 Colo. 197, 499 P.2d 611 (1972).</T>
   <P></P>
   <T>
    <B>"Just determination" inquiry or determination regarding imposition of a mental
status defense over the objection of the defendant</B> requires a balancing of the
public's
interest in not holding criminally liable a defendant lacking criminal responsibility and
the defendant's interest in autonomously controlling the nature of person's defense.
Under subsection (2) and § 16-8-103.5 (2) the court must consider
not only the defendant's stated reasons for objecting to the mental status defenses at the
time of arraignment--but also the defendant's state of mind at the time of the commission
of the offense. Against this, the court must consider the defendant's reasons for
attempting to forego assertion of the mental status defense by examining whether those
reasons satisfy a "basic rationality" inquiry. Hendricks v. People, 10 P.3d 1231 (Colo.
2000).</T>
   <P></P>
   <T>Trial court must first consider the viability of the mental status defense that defense
counsel requests the court to assert on behalf of the defendant. This requires the court to
assess the mental state of the defendant at the time of the commission of the offense to
determine whether there is substantial evidence that the defendant may not be guilty
because of the defendant's mental status. Hendricks v. People, 10 P.3d 1231 (Colo.
2000).</T>
   <P></P>
   <T>Defendant's choice should be accorded substantial weight in evaluating whether
imposition of a mental status defense results in a "just determination of the charge
against
the defendant". At the same time it is inappropriate to give weight to a defendant's
choice
if the choice is founded in the defendant's delusions or is otherwise devoid of a rational
basis.
To satisfy this inquiry the trial court must assess whether the defendant's reason for the
decision has a plausible grounding in reality. Hendricks v. People, 10 P.3d 1231 (Colo.
2000).</T>
   <P></P>
   <T>A finding of competency to stand trial does not substitute for a finding of basic
rationality. Hendricks v. People, 10 P.3d 1231 (Colo. 2000).</T>
   <P></P>
   <T>An individual's interest in autonomously controlling the nature of his or her defense,
provided that interest is premised on a choice that satisfies the basic rationality test, will
predominate over the broader interest of society unless pressing concerns mandate a
contrary result. Hendricks v. People, 10 P.3d 1231 (Colo. 2000).</T>
   <P></P>
   <T>
    <B>It is mandatory</B> to the extent that it requires a defendant who intends to
defend
on
the
ground of insanity to interpose an appropriate plea. But this does not mean that this
section
operates to exclude every other possible mental examination of an accused. Early v.
People,
142 Colo. 462, 352 P.2d 112, cert. denied, 364 U.S. 847, 81 S. Ct. 90, 5

   <T>A defendant desiring to rely upon insanity as a defense in a criminal action is bound
to comply with the provisions of this section concerning the entry of such plea. Robbins
v. People, 142 Colo. 254, 350 P.2d 818 (1960).</T>
   <P></P>
   <T>
    <B>But it does not compel self-incrimination.</B> Since a defendant under a plea
of
not
guilty can offer evidence of his insanity bearing upon his ability to form criminal intent,
it cannot be said that he is compelled to enter a plea of not guilty by reason of insanity
under this section and his election to do so cannot be held compulsory incrimination.
Castro v. People, 140 Colo. 493, 346 P.2d 1020 (1959).</T>
   <P></P>
   <T>
    <B>Where the defendant does not enter a special plea raising the defense of
insanity,</B>
any evidence introduced at his trial which would support
such a plea is irrelevant and inadmissible. People v. Low, 732 P.2d
622 (Colo. 1987).</T>
   <P></P>
   <T>
    <B>Rationale for excusing from criminal responsibility.</B>
A person who is criminally insane is excused from criminal responsibility for his actions
because,
due to a mental disease or defect, he lacks
the capacity to distinguish right from wrong with respect
to the act or to adhere to the right or refrain from the wrong. Hendershott v. People, 653
P.2d
385 (Colo. 1982), cert. denied, 459 U.S. 1225,
103 S. Ct. 1232, 75 L. Ed. 2d 466 (1983).</T>
   <P></P>
   <T>
    <B>Insane persons are not necessarily incompetent to stand trial</B> because
of the fact of their insanity. People v. Benns, 641 P.2d 298 (Colo. App. 1981).</T>
   <P></P>
   <T>
    <B>Putting accused on trial while he is incompetent violates due process
of law.</B> Jones v. District Court, 617 P.2d 803 (Colo. 1980).</T>

   <T>
    <B>And prohibition attaches at commencement of formal criminal proceedings

   <P></P>
   <T>
    <B>Defense counsel to bring belief of accused's incompetence to court's
attention.</B> When defense counsel has reason to believe the accused is
incompetent, he is obliged to bring this matter to the court's attention
even though it might be to the disadvantage of the accused. Jones v. District
Court, 617 P.2d 803 (Colo. 1980).</T>
   <P></P>
   <T>
    <B>And court to inquire where issue of competency raised.</B> Where defense
attorney's representation to the court raised a substantial issue as to
the petitioner's competency to stand trial, trial court's refusal to make
any inquiry into that issue or to receive any evidence in that
regard constituted an abuse of discretion. Jones v. District Court,
617 P.2d 803 (Colo. 1980).</T>
   <P></P>
   <T>
    <B>Or due process is violated</B> when a trial court refuses to accord an
accused an adequate hearing on his claimed incompetency to stand trial.
Jones v. District Court, 617 P.2d 803 (Colo. 1980).</T>
   <P></P>
   <T>
    <B>Choice of entering plea left to defendant.</B>
The tactical choice of whether to enter a plea of not guilty by reason of
insanity by a defendant found "mentally competent" is left to the defendant
and his counsel. People v. Lopez, 640 P.2d 275 (Colo. App. 1982).</T>
   <P></P>
   <T>When a defendant is competent to proceed, the tactical choice whether to
utilize the affirmative defense of insanity should be left up to the defendant
and his counsel. People v. Benns, 641 P.2d 298 (Colo. App. 1981).</T>
   <P></P>
   <T>
    <B>No authority for court to raise defense unless requested by defendant.</B>
Neither Crim. P. 11(e) nor this section gives a trial
court the authority to enter a plea of not guilty by reason of
insanity when it has not been requested by the defendant or his
counsel. Labor v. Gibson, 195 Colo. 416,

    <B>Entitled to instruction on commitment procedures.</B>
A defendant who is relying on an insanity defense is entitled,
upon request, to an instruction on commitment procedures. People v. Thomson,

   <P></P>
   <T>The court should give a jury instruction which clearly and simply explains the

to the defendant of an insanity verdict. Such an
instruction should clearly indicate that it is only

verdict.

Prior to arraignment, counsel for defendant had discussed the insanity defense

insanity and counsel agreed. However, when defendant was severed from his
codefendants for trial, he disclosed new evidence to his
counsel, which led counsel to the discovery of other evidence indicative of
a foundation for insanity pleas, and, on the basis of this new
knowledge, counsel again discussed the possibility
of the insanity defense with him, and he then stated that he wanted
to so plead. On the basis of this showing, the trial court acted

    <B>The plea of impaired mental condition</B> must be raised at the arraignment
of the defendant or such plea is waived. People v. Low, 732 P.2d 622 (Colo.
1987); People v. Fincham, 799 P.2d 419 (Colo. App. 1990).</T>
   <P></P>
   <T>
    <B>The affirmative defense of impaired mental condition is separate and
distinct from the defense of insanity;</B> its sole effect is to negate the
existence of an element of the crime charged. However, if a defendant
intends
to raise the defense of impaired mental condition at trial, he must also
specially plead the defense at arraignment. People v. Bolton, 859 P.2d 311
(Colo. App. 1993).</T>
   <P></P>
   <T>
    <B>Exclusion of impaired mental condition defense for noncompliance with
discovery order</B> by reason of prejudice to prosecution was not an abuse of
discretion where defendant was examined six months prior to
trial and at a time when he was represented by counsel, yet only declared his
intention to use a defense of impaired mental condition just before trial, and
no events occurred after non-compliance which mitigated
prejudice to prosecution. People v. Reger, 731 P.2d 752 (Colo. App. 1986).</T>
   <P></P>
   <T>
    <B>Testimony relating to an impaired mental condition defense may be

No such limitation is found in this section or § 16-8-103.6.
People v. Sandoval, 805 P.2d 1126 (Colo. App. 1990).</T>
   <P></P>
   <T>
    <B>"Just determination" inquiry or determination regarding imposition of a mental
status defense over the objection of the defendant</B> requires a balancing of the
public's
interest in not holding criminally liable a defendant lacking criminal responsibility and
the defendant's interest in autonomously controlling the nature of person's defense.
Under subsection (2) and § 16-8-103 (2) the court must consider not
only the defendant's stated reasons for objecting to the mental status defenses at the time
of arraignment--but also the defendant's state of mind at the time of the commission of
the
offense. Against this, the court must consider the defendant's reasons for attempting to
forego assertion of the mental status defense by examining whether those reasons satisfy
a "basic rationality" inquiry. Hendricks v. People, 10 P.3d 1231 (Colo. 2000).</T>
   <P></P>
   <T>Trial court must first consider the viability of the mental status defense that defense
counsel requests the court to assert on behalf of the defendant. This requires the court to
assess the mental state of the defendant at the time of the commission of the offense to
determine whether there is substantial evidence that the defendant may not be guilty
because of the defendant's mental status. Hendricks v. People, 10 P.3d 1231 (Colo.
2000).</T>
   <P></P>
   <T>Defendant's choice should be accorded substantial weight in evaluating whether
imposition of a mental status defense results in a "just determination of the charge
against
the defendant". At the same time it is inappropriate to give weight to a defendant's
choice
if the choice is founded in the defendant's delusions or is otherwise devoid of a rational
basis. To satisfy this inquiry the trial court must assess whether the defendant's reason
for the decision has a plausible grounding in reality. Hendricks v. People, 10 P.3d 1231
(Colo. 2000).</T>
   <P></P>
   <T>A finding of competency to stand trial does not substitute for a finding of basic
rationality. Hendricks v. People, 10 P.3d 1231 (Colo. 2000).</T>
   <P></P>
   <T>An individual's interest in autonomously controlling the nature of his or her defense,
provided that interest is premised on a choice that satisfies the basic rationality test, will
predominate over the broader interest of society unless pressing concerns mandate a
contrary result. Hendricks v. People, 10 P.3d 1231 (Colo. 2000).</T>

   <P></P>
   <T>This section provides for the order of trial of an offense

806 (1955).</T>
   <P></P>
   <T>
    <B>Or other constitutional rights.</B> The right to a trial by a
jury of 12, the right to a speedy public trial by an impartial
jury, due process, and other constitutional rights are not violated
because the trial of the issues separately results in one trial.
Leick v. People, 136 Colo. 535, 322 P.2d 674, cert. denied, 357
U.S. 922, 78 S. Ct. 1363, 2 L. Ed. 2d 1366 (1958).</T>
   <P></P>
   <T>
    <B>Purpose of separate trials.</B> Separate trials of the issues
of guilt and of mental condition are provided to safeguard, as far
as possible, against the prejudice likely to arise in the minds of
a jury trying both the issue of guilt and of mental condition by
reason of the wide variety of evidence which might be competent
on the issue of insanity and which would not be admissible upon
trial of the not guilty plea. Trujillo v. People, 150 Colo. 235,
372 P.2d 86 (1962).</T>
   <P></P>
   <T>The bifurcated trial was designed to eliminate many
constitutional challenges where the issues of insanity
and guilt were resolved in the unitary trial. Lewis v.
Thulemeyer, 189 Colo. 139, 538 P.2d 441 (1975).</T>
   <P></P>
   <T>
    <B>Purpose of sanity trial limited.</B>
A sanity trial is designed to determine whether the defendant was sane or
insane at the time of the alleged offense, and the issue of guilt or innocence
plays no part in the resolution of this issue. People v. Morgan, 637 P.2d
338 (Colo. 1981).</T>
   <P></P>
   <T>
    <B>Separate trials utilize separate juries.</B> In Colorado there
are two separate and distinct trials, utilizing two separate and distinct
juries, whenever the plea of not guilty by reason of insanity is raised.
Lewis v. People, 174 Colo. 334, 483 P.2d 949 (1971).</T>
   <P></P>
   <T>In a proceeding under this section, if the cause is set for
trial to the jury on the issue of insanity only, and the defendant
is found sane, then the defendant shall be tried on the issue of
guilt at a later time to a different jury. People v.
Kernanen, 178 Colo. 234, 497 P.2d 8 (1972).</T>
   <P></P>
   <T>
    <B>Which constitute but one trial.</B> This section provides
for disposition of a plea of insanity in a criminal case before
trial of the issue of not guilty; although such issues are tried
separately, they constitute but one trial. Leick v. People, 136
Colo. 535, 322 P.2d 674, cert. denied, 357 U.S. 922, 78 S. Ct.
1363, 2 L. Ed. 2d 1366 (1958).</T>
   <P></P>
   <T>Under the procedure permitting a disposition of the insanity
issue before the issue of not guilty, the trial is conducted in
sections which together constitute one trial. The action is
single. People ex rel. Juhan v. District Court, 165 Colo. 253,
439 P.2d 741 (1968).</T>
   <P></P>
   <T>
    <B>And a single judgment to the charge results.</B> Where there
is but a single charge to which a defendant pleads not guilty
by reason of insanity at the time of the commission of the offense
and the further plea of not guilty, and the issues so raised are
tried separately, a single judgment only could be entered.
Leick v. People, 136 Colo. 535, 322 P.2d 674, cert. denied, 357
U.S. 922, 78 S. Ct. 1363, 2 L. Ed. 2d 1366 (1958).</T>
   <P></P>
   <T>
    <B>Procedure does not make trial a civil case.</B> The fact
that the issue of insanity defense has been separated from other
questions for the purpose of trial does not make a civil case
out of that which is tendered as a defense to an accusation
of crime. Castro v. People, 140 Colo. 493, 346 P.2d 1020 (1959);
People ex rel. Juhan v. District Court, 165 Colo. 253, 439 P.2d
741 (1968).</T>
   <P></P>
   <T>
    <B>However, in the sanity trial, defendant's testimony is not considered within the
same
constitutional guarantees</B> as it is in the guilt trial. It is not error for the judge to not
give
a Curtis advisement concerning the right to testify and previous convictions. People v.
Chou, 981 P.2d 668 (Colo. App. 1999).</T>
   <P></P>
   <T>
    <B>And proof beyond a reasonable doubt is required of issues
in separate trial.</B> By procedurally requiring a separate trial
on the issue of mental capacity to commit any crime -- which
admittedly is a necessary ingredient of any offense -- the
material ingredient set apart for separate trial shall be
governed by all the firmly established doctrine that as to
every necessary ingredient of the total crime there must be
proof beyond a reasonable doubt. People ex rel. Juhan v.
District Court, 165 Colo. 253, 439 P.2d 741 (1968).</T>
   <P></P>
   <T>In Colorado, the sanity trial stands on the same footing
with the trial on the other elements of the crime. Parks v.
Denver District Court, 180 Colo. 202,
503 P.2d 1029 (1972).</T>
   <P></P>
   <T>
    <B>In considering a motion for a directed verdict in a sanity trial
under this section, the trial court must consider the evidence,</B> together
with reasonable inferences therefrom, in the light most favorable
to the people, and, if there is substantial competent evidence to
support a verdict in favor of the people, the motion must be denied
and the matter submitted to the jury for determination. People v. King, 181 Colo. 439,
510 P.2d 333 (1973).</T>
   <P></P>
   <T>
    <B>Defendant was not placed in double jeopardy on insanity issue.</B> Where
defendant, charged with homicide, moved for a separate trial on the sanity issue
as provided by this section, he was not placed in double jeopardy where the trial court's
direction of verdict of insanity was held erroneous and the defendant was
retried on the sanity issue. People v. King, 181 Colo. 439,
510 P.2d 333 (1973).</T>
   <P></P>
   <T>
    <B>Grant of new trial on sanity does not require
new trial on merits.</B> When a separate sanity trial
has been held which results in an erroneous verdict
requiring a new sanity trial, it is not necessary to
also grant a new trial on the merits where there is
no prejudicial error in the trial of the substantive
charge. Young v. People, 175 Colo. 461, 488 P.2d 567
(1971); Lewis v. People, 174 Colo. 334, 483 P.2d 949 (1971).</T>
   <P></P>
   <T>
    <B>Admission of psychiatric report on sanity but not
guilt issues.</B> The general assembly, in providing for the
admission in evidence of defendant's statements to the

    <B>Insanity procedure does not compel self-incrimination.</B>
No change in the matter of incarceration and observation is

   <T>
    <B>Refusal to cooperate in examination does not forfeit
defense.</B> A person accused of a crime who enters a plea of not
guilty by reason of insanity cannot be compelled to carry on
conversations against his will under the penalty of forfeiture
of the defense for failure to respond to questions, or for a refusal
to "cooperate" with persons appointed to examine him. Section 16-8-106
and this section, which prescribe the procedures to be followed upon
the entry of a plea of not guilty by reason of insanity, cannot operate
to destroy the constitutional safeguards against self-incrimination.

   <P></P>
   <T>
    <B>This section can have but one meaning; the commitment
must follow immediately after the entry of the plea.</B> It fixes
a period of time intervening between the date on which a defendant
enters his plea and the date on which the issues thus raised shall
be tried. Within this intervening period, and "forthwith" upon
the entry of the plea, the commitment for observation and examination
must be made. Martin v. District Court, 129 Colo. 27, 272 P.2d
648 (1954).</T>
   <P></P>
   <T>
    <B>Trial may not precede commitment.</B> Where one accused
of a felony enters pleas of "not guilty" and "not guilty by reason
of insanity", it is not permissible to try defendant on the issues
raised by his not guilty plea prior to any commitment for observation
and examination as required by § 16-8-106. Martin v. District

   <P></P>
   <T>
    <B>Primary purpose of immediate commitment</B>
is to furnish the state with an opportunity to assess the defendant's mental

   <P></P>
   <T>
    <B>Commitment proceedings require due process consideration.</B>
Commitment to a mental institution constitutes a severe infringement on

   <P></P>
   <T>
    <B>Jury trial may be waived.</B> This section requiring that
if defense waives jury trial on the issue of insanity in a

   <T>The order of proof before the jury is discretionary with the

   <P></P>
   <T>Statutory requirement that prosecution consent to waiver of jury in sanity trial
applied
to
trial
of defendant prosecuted for second-degree
murder rather than subsequently enacted general statute, § 18-1-406
(2), which did not refer to prosecutor's consent to waiver of jury trial. People v. District
Court,
731 P.2d 720 (Colo. 1987).</T>
   <P></P>
   <T>Distinction between classes of felonies where consent of court and prosecution must

has rational foundation. People v. District Court, 731 P.2d 720 (Colo. 1987).</T>
   <P></P>
   <T>
    <B>And the prosecution may fortify the presumption of
sanity</B> by the presentation of evidence tending to establish
the fact of sanity. Henderson v. People, 156 Colo. 229,
397 P.2d 872 (1965).</T>
   <P></P>
   <T>
    <B>And introduce evidence of sanity as case in chief.</B>
Where a defendant by cross-examination of the people's
witnesses produces evidence rebutting the presumption of
sanity, it is incumbent on the prosecution to prove the
sanity of defendant as part of its case in chief, and it
is not error to receive such evidence. Castro v. People,
140 Colo. 493, 346 P.2d 1020 (1959).</T>
   <P></P>
   <T>
    <B>Evidence of normal or abnormal conduct is relevant
on sanity issue.</B> A much wider area of conduct on the part
of a defendant can be made the subject of inquiry in a trial
relating to his sanity than would be permissible in a trial
upon a plea of not guilty. Any abnormal conduct, whether
related to the act forming the basis of the accusation
or not, may be relevant and important on the issue of his
mental condition. Conversely, evidence of normal conduct,
and actions reflecting the usual and ordinary under the
circumstances, may be shown to prove sanity. Trujillo v.
People, 150 Colo. 235, 372 P.2d 86 (1962).</T>
   <P></P>
   <T>
    <B>And jury has discretion to infer lack of mental
capacity from appearance or conduct</B> of the accused
while in their presence, or from the factual circumstances
disclosed by the evidence, thus evidence of sanity should
not be excluded whether offered as part of the case in
chief or upon rebuttal. Henderson v. People, 156 Colo.
229, 397 P.2d 872 (1965); Palmer v. People, 162
Colo. 92, 424 P.2d 766 (1967).</T>
   <P></P>
   <T>
    <B>Thus, expert testimony is not conclusive on the jury</B>
and must be weighed along with all other testimony. Palmer v.
People, 162 Colo. 92, 424 P.2d 766 (1967).</T>
   <P></P>
   <T>A jury is not bound by the testimony of experts and is free
to believe lay testimony over any other. People v. Ware, 187 Colo. 28,
528 P.2d 224 (1974).</T>
   <P></P>
   <T>
    <B>Neither is defendant's acknowledged status as a ward of the state</B>
conclusive evidence of insanity. It does not follow from a
commitment to such an institution that one necessarily is incapable of
forming an intent to commit a crime. McConnell v. People, 157 Colo.
235, 402 P.2d 75 (1965).</T>
   <P></P>
   <T>
    <B>Trial court has discretion to determine order in which evidence will
be presented</B> at the sanity trial. People v. Osborn, 42 Colo. App. 376,

   <P></P>
   <T>The order of proof before the jury is discretionary with the court for there is no

687 (1971).</T>
   <P></P>
   <T>
    <B>Scope of evidence admissible</B>
on the issue of insanity is broad.
People v. Wright, 648 P.2d 665 (Colo. 1982).</T>
   <P></P>
   <T>
    <B>Evidence offered must touch issue.</B> While evidence going only to
the commission of the act and to the surrounding circumstances is relevant,
the evidence offered in some way must touch on the issue of whether the defendant
could distinguish between right and wrong and adhere to the right and refrain
from the wrong. People v. Ware, 187 Colo. 28,
528 P.2d 224 (1974).</T>
   <P></P>
   <T>
    <B>Defense attorney entitled to physician's information.</B>
Where the confessions and admissions of the defendant have been

sanity or insanity of the defendant does not aid in the
proof of guilt, but it is perforce limited to the issue of
sanity.

    <B>District attorney's statement improper.</B> Where the district attorney
in his closing argument stated that if they found the defendant to be
insane, he would never be tried for the criminal act charged, this
statement was improper. People v. Medina, 185 Colo. 101,
521 P.2d 1257 (1974).</T>
   <P></P>
   <T>
    <B>Defendant pleading insanity entitled to have such form of
verdict submitted.</B> Defendant pled insanity, along with his general
plea of not guilty, which plea was never formally withdrawn, though in
practical effect it was abandoned as no evidence was offered on the
issue raised by the plea of insanity. Defendant, had he so desired,
was entitled to have appropriate forms of verdict on this issue
submitted to the jury. Cruz v. People, 147 Colo. 528, 364 P.2d 561
(1961), cert. denied, 368 U.S. 978, 82 S. Ct. 483, 7 L. Ed. 2d 440 (1962).</T>
   <P></P>
   <T>Upon trial neither the people nor the defendant offered any
evidence related to the issue raised by the plea of insanity.
Nevertheless, it was error to direct the jury to find the defendant
sane and defendant, had he so desired, was entitled to have appropriate
instructions on the questions of insanity and to have forms of verdict
on this issue submitted to the jury. Henderson v. People, 156 Colo.
229, 397 P.2d 872 (1965).</T>
   <P></P>
   <T>
    <B>And verdict as to guilt does not dispose of insanity issue.</B>
When a defendant pleads not guilty and not guilty by reason of
insanity and at trial the defense attorney states that the trial will
go forward on the not guilty plea, a verdict of guilty does not
dispose of the insanity issue which must be tried to a jury unless
the insanity plea is withdrawn. People v. Duran, 179 Colo. 129, 498
P.2d 937 (1972).</T>
   <P></P>
   <T>
    <B>Error in failing to so submit verdict may be waived.</B>
Counsel for defendant, after examining the proposed forms
of verdict, had no objections nor did he tender any additional
forms of verdicts. Thus, defendant cannot successfully predicate
error on the failure of the trial court to submit a form of verdict
on the issue raised by the insanity plea. Cruz v. People, 147 Colo.
528, 364 P.2d 561 (1961), cert. denied, 368 U.S. 978, 82 S. Ct. 483,

   <P></P>
   <T>
    <B>Instruction on status of defendant after verdict properly
refused.</B> In a criminal case where the defense is insanity,
the jury has no duty to perform with reference to subsequent orders
of court after a verdict of not guilty by reason of insanity is
returned, and a requested instruction concerning the status of
defendant after such a verdict is properly refused. Ingles v.

   <P></P>
   <T>
    <B>Determination of insanity does not bar subsequent prosecution
for separate crime committed hours later.</B> The determination
by one district court that defendant was insane at the time of a
crime committed within that district does not bar a subsequent
prosecution in another district court for a separate crime
committed a few hours later within that district. People v.
Kernanen, 178 Colo. 234, 497 P.2d 8 (1972).</T>
   <P></P>
   <T>
    <B>But issue of sanity at time of earlier crime is final.</B>
The doctrine of collateral estoppel affords the defendant
the right in a subsequent sanity trial to claim finality
with respect to the fact that he had become insane at the
time of the commission of a crime several hours earlier in
another county and, given this fact, the prosecution will
not be able to prove the defendant's sanity unless it can show
that the defendant's mental state changed abruptly sometime
after the earlier offense was committed. People v.
Kernanen, 178 Colo. 234, 497 P.2d 8 (1972).</T>
   <P></P>
   <T>
    <B>As is finding of sanity at hearing prior to trial on
guilt issue.</B> The argument that the defendant was incapable
of forming the requisite mens rea and, therefore, he could
not be criminally responsible for his acts, is unpersuasive
where the defendant was found sane in a separate sanity
hearing prior to trial on the issue of guilt, and no objection
was raised as to the propriety of the proceedings. Johnson v.

   <P></P>
   <T>
    <B>Colorado's statutory procedure does not permit the issue of sanity to be

has not been rebutted. People v. Hill, 934 P.2d 821 (Colo. 1997); People v. Anderson,

In accordance with People v. Medina (705 P.2d 961), treatment with
antipsychotic medication should not be ordered unless: (1) The patient is
incompetent to effectively participate in the treatment decision;
(2) such treatment is necessary to prevent long-term deterioration in the
patient's mental condition; (3) a less intrusive treatment is not
available; and (4) the patient's need for such treatment overrides any
legitimate interest of the patient in refusing treatment. Any order for
involuntary medication cannot exceed six months without further extension.

been proven beyond a reasonable doubt as to one or more of the
felony charges submitted for consideration, the special

deliberations on the felony charges as previously set forth in
this subsection (3), the trier of fact shall consider any other

not answer the special interrogatories regarding such charges if
it has previously found guilt beyond a reasonable doubt with
respect to one or more felony charges. The interrogatories shall
provide for specific findings of the jury with respect to the

(1)<N></N>(a)<M>All examinations ordered by the court in criminal cases
shall be
accomplished by the entry of an order of the court specifying the place where such
examination is to be conducted and the period of time allocated for such examination.
The defendant may be committed for such examination to the Colorado psychiatric
hospital in Denver, the Colorado mental health institute at Pueblo, the place where he or
she is in custody, or such other public institution designated by the court. In determining
the place where such examination is to be conducted, the court shall give priority to the
place where the defendant is in custody, unless the nature and circumstances of the
examination require designation of a different facility. The defendant shall be observed
and examined by one or more psychiatrists or forensic psychologists during such period
as the court directs. For good cause shown, upon motion of the prosecution or defendant,
or upon the court's own motion, the court may order such further or other examination as
is advisable under the circumstances. Nothing in this section shall abridge the right of the
defendant to procure an examination as provided in section 16-8-108.</M>

or 18-3-405.5, C.R.S., pursuant to this section must be video and audio recorded and
preserved. The court shall advise the defendant that any examination with a psychiatrist
or forensic psychologist may be video and audio recorded. A copy of the recording must
be provided to all parties and the court with the examination report. Any jail or other
facility where the court orders the examination to take place must permit the recording to
occur and must provide the space and equipment necessary for such recording. If space
and equipment are not available, the sheriff or facility director shall attempt to coordinate
a location and the availability of equipment with the court, which may consult with the
district attorney and defense counsel for an agreed upon location. If no agreement is
reached, and upon the request of either the defense counsel or district attorney, the court
shall order the location of the examination, which may include the Colorado mental
health institute at Pueblo.</M>

psychiatrist or forensic psychologist shall assess whether the recording of the
examination is likely to cause or is causing mental or physical harm to the defendant or
others or will make the examination not useful to the expert forensic opinion. If such a
determination is made and documented contemporaneously in writing, the psychiatrist or
forensic psychologist shall not record the examination or shall cease recording the
examination, and the psychiatrist or forensic psychologist shall advise the court and the
parties of this determination and the reasons therefore in a written report to the court. If
only a partial recording is made, the psychiatrist or forensic psychologist shall provide
the partial recording to the court and the parties, and the partial recording may be used by
any psychiatrist or forensic psychologist in forming an opinion, submitting a report, or
testifying on the issue of the defendant's mental health.</M>

evidence on the issue of insanity or at any sentencing hearing held pursuant to section
18-1.3-1201 for an offense charged prior to July 1, 2020, or pursuant to section

examination.
In any trial or hearing on the issue of the defendant's sanity, eligibility for release, or
impaired mental condition, and in any sentencing hearing held pursuant to section
18-1.3-1201 or 18-1.3-1302, C.R.S., the physicians and other personnel conducting the

    <B>Defendant's statutory privilege against self-incrimination</B> during course

extend to proceedings conducted for sentencing purposes. And, even if the
constitutional privilege against self-incrimination is assumed to apply to
the use of information for
sentencing purposes after guilt has been established, the defendant waived
his right against self-incrimination where he consented to use of reports
from court-ordered psychiatric examination

    <B>Admissions to privately retained psychiatrist privileged.</B>
The prosecution may not call, as a witness in its case-in-chief, a psychiatrist

during a sanity examination. People v. Rosenthal, 617 P.2d 551 (Colo. 1980).</T>
   <P></P>
   <T>
    <B>But copy of report to prosecution if defense to offer testimony of exam.</B>
The only limitation placed on a defendant seeking a sanity examination by
a private psychiatrist is that a copy of the psychiatrist's report be furnished
to the prosecution reasonably in advance of the sanity trial if the defense

    <B>Refusal to cooperate with examiners does not forfeit defense.</B>
A person accused of a crime, who enters a plea of not guilty by reason
of insanity, cannot be compelled to carry on conversations
against his will under the penalty of forfeiture of the defense for
failure to respond to questions, or for refusal to "cooperate"
with persons appointed to examine him. Section 16-8-105 and this section, which

Johnson v. People, 172 Colo. 72, 470 P.2d 37 (1970).</T>
   <P></P>
   <T>It is permissible to use defendant's silence at a sanity examination as evidence of his

her sanity, especially where the defendant was specifically informed that, if he refused to
cooperate with the examining physician, such noncooperation could be referred to at his
trial
and where the jurors were instructed that they could consider defendant's refusal to speak
with the examining psychiatrist only in considering defendant's mental state and for no
other
purpose. People v. Tally, 7 P.3d 172 (Colo. App. 1999).</T>

In order to justify a reversal on the ground that the hospital

such evidence and without having undergone a court-ordered examination pursuant to
section 16-8-106. A defendant who places his or her mental condition at issue by giving
such notice waives any claim of confidentiality or privilege as provided in section

   <T>
    <B>Annotator's note.</B> Since § 16-8-107 is similar to
§ 39-8-2, C.R.S. 1963, § 39-8-2, CRS 53, and laws
antecedent to CSA, C. 48, § 508, relevant cases construing
those provisions have been included in the annotations to
this section.</T>
   <P></P>
   <T>
    <B>Subsection (3)(b) does not violate the separation of powers doctrine.</B> The
statute is a mix between substantive law and procedural rules. People v. Bondurant, 2012
COA 50, 296 P.3d 200.</T>
   <P></P>
   <T>Although affecting the procedure of the courts, subsection (3)(b) also concerns the
public policy of full disclosure in criminal cases involving a defense based on a
defendant's mental condition. People v. Bondurant, 2012 COA 50, 296 P.3d 200.</T>
   <P></P>
   <T>
    <B>Subsection (3)(b) does not conflict with Crim. P. 11(e) or 16, part II, in violation
of the separation of powers doctrine.</B> People v. Bondurant, 2012 COA 50, 296 P.3d
200.</T>
   <P></P>
   <T>
    <B>This section is not void for vagueness.</B> The term "mental condition" in
subsection (3)(b) includes mental illness within its ordinary meaning and impaired
mental
condition, so the statute is not incomprehensible in all applications. People v. Bondurant,
2012 COA 50, 296 P.3d 200.</T>
   <P></P>
   <T>The term "cooperate" is capable of a common meaning. People v. Bondurant, 2012
COA 50, 296 P.3d 200.</T>
   <P></P>
   <T>
    <B>This section does not violate a defendant's constitutional privilege against
self-incrimination.</B> The information obtained in compulsory mental examinations is
admissible only on the issue of mental condition and insanity raised by defendants
themselves. People v. Bondurant, 2012 COA 50, 296 P.3d 200.</T>
   <P></P>
   <T>
    <B>This section does not violate a defendant's fundamental right to present a
defense
or the right to effective assistance of counsel.</B> A defendant can present a defense if
he or she complies with the statute. People v. Bondurant, 2012 COA 50, 296 P.3d 200.</T>
   <P></P>
   <T>
    <B>The evidentiary prerequisites of this section do not apply to the Colorado
Children's Code and specifically to delinquency proceedings.</B> Because the Colorado
Code of Criminal Procedure expressly provides that it does not apply to proceedings
under the Children's Code except as specifically set forth in the Criminal Procedure Code
itself, and because no such provision exists in the Criminal Procedure Code, this section
does not apply to proceedings under the Children's Code. In re People in Interest of A.A.,
2013 CO 65, 312 P.3d 1170.</T>
   <P></P>
   <T>
    <B>Separate trials designed as safeguard against prejudice.</B>
On a separate trial of a plea of not guilty by reason of insanity
in a murder prosecution, a much wider area of defendant's
conduct may be the subject of inquiry than would be permissible
in trial of a plea of not guilty; separate trials of such
issues are provided to safeguard against prejudice likely to
arise by reason of wide variety of evidence competent on issue
of insanity but which would not be admissible on trial of a not
guilty plea. Trujillo v. People, 150 Colo. 235, 372 P.2d 86
(1962).</T>
   <P></P>
   <T>
    <B>Recognition of the constitutional rights of the defendant
relative to self-incrimination appears in subsection (1).</B>
Lewis v. Thulemeyer, 189 Colo. 139, 538 P.2d 441 (1975).</T>
   <P></P>
   <T>The general assembly, in providing for the admission in
evidence of defendant's statements to the psychiatrist where
sanity is the issue, but barring them on the guilt issue, does
not violate the defendant's rights against self-incrimination.
Lewis v. Thulemeyer, 189 Colo. 139, 538 P.2d 441 (1975).</T>
   <P></P>
   <T>When the sanity issue is a separate proceeding, as it is
in Colorado, before a jury that cannot consider the issue of
guilt in the event the defendant is found sane and where the
admissions cannot be used to establish guilt, there is no
self-incrimination within the contemplation of the constitutional
provisions.
Lewis v. Thulemeyer, 189 Colo. 139, 538 P.2d 441 (1975).</T>
   <P></P>
   <T>In a sanity trial the admission of statements made by the defendant does
not violate his right against self-incrimination because the issue
of defendant's guilt is not decided.
People v. Osborn, 42 Colo. App. 376, 599 P.2d 937 (1979).</T>
   <P></P>
   <T>
    <B>Subsection (1.5)(a) does not violate the privilege against
self-incrimination.</B> The only permissible use of statements made during a sanity
examination is to determine whether a defendant was capable of forming a culpable
mental state. People v. Herrera, 87 P.3d 240 (Colo. App. 2003).</T>
   <P></P>
   <T>
    <B>The court's limiting instruction and surrounding instructions regarding the
expert's testimony on the issue of defendant's sanity adequately protected defendant's
privilege against self-incrimination.</B> People v. Grenier, 200 P.3d 1062 (Colo. App.
2008).</T>
   <P></P>
   <T>
    <B>This section does not force a defendant to choose between the privilege against
self-incrimination and the due process right to a competency determination.</B> A
defendant may remain silent during the court-ordered evaluation under this section and
then
be examined by a psychiatrist of his own choice under §16-8-108. Therefore, under
the
statutory scheme, the defendant could obtain a competency evaluation and protect his
privilege against self-incrimination unless and until he relied upon the lack of mental
capacity to commit the charged crimes. People v. Thomas, 962 P.2d 263 (Colo. App.
1997).</T>
   <P></P>
   <T>
    <B>This section does not force a defendant to choose between his privilege against
self-incrimination and his fundamental right to present a defense.</B> People v.
Roadcap, 78 P.3d 1108 (Colo. App. 2003).</T>
   <P></P>
   <T>Defendant could comply with subsection (3)(b) without waiving his privilege against
self-incrimination by invoking the privilege during the court-ordered examination.
People v. Roadcap, 78 P.3d 1108 (Colo. App. 2003).</T>
   <P></P>
   <T>
    <B>Use in impeaching defendant constitutional.</B> Neither
the United States constitution nor the Colorado constitution
should be construed to allow a defendant to take the stand
without the possibility of his credibility being impeached
by his prior inconsistent statements. Where the defendant
makes statements to a psychiatrist upon the advice of his
counsel and without physical coercion and intimidation, he
cannot take the stand with his credibility immune from
attack on the basis of his prior inconsistent statements.
People v. Pearson, 190 Colo. 313, 546 P.2d 1259 (1976).</T>
   <P></P>
   <T>
    <B>When cross-examination for impeachment purposes not narrowly
limited.</B> When a defendant elects to fabricate testimony to
effectively commit perjury, cross-examination for the purpose of
impeachment is not narrowly limited.
People v. Allen, 193 Colo. 526, 568 P.2d 56 (1977).</T>
   <P></P>
   <T>
    <B>Miranda warnings not required.</B> Even assuming that
warnings are required, or that the examination under this
section was a type of custodial interrogation requiring
that defendant be given the equivalent of Miranda v.
Arizona (384 U.S. 436, 86 S. Ct. 1602, 16 L. Ed. 2d 694
(1966)) warnings prior to his examination,
such warnings are not required before the admission of
statements for impeachment purposes. People v. Pearson,
190 Colo. 313, 546 P.2d 1259 (1976).</T>
   <P></P>
   <T>
    <B>The last sentence of subsection (1) cannot be
interpreted as only permitting</B> the admission of
statements concerning defendant's lack of capacity
to form a specific intent and as not allowing the
admission of statements concerning other issues of
his guilt. People v. Pearson, 190 Colo. 313, 546 P.2d
1259 (1976).</T>
   <P></P>
   <T>
    <B>The reference in subsection (1.5)(a) to issues raised by the insanity plea relates
to the defendant's "mental condition" and is equivalent to the references in subsection
(1)(a) to a defendant's "capacity to form a culpable mental state".</B> People v. Herrera,
87 P.3d 240 (Colo. App. 2003).</T>
   <P></P>
   <T>
    <B>Subsection (2) allows for prosecution to call "other experts" to testify as to their
observations, conversations, and opinions regarding a defendant's mental condition.</B>
Prosecution presented sufficient evidence that defendant's behavior was not driven by
insanity but by drugs and antisocial behavior. People v. Porter, 2013 COA 130, 353 P.3d
852, rev'd on other grounds, 2015 CO 34, 348 P.3d 922.</T>
   <P></P>
   <T>
    <B>Evidence from examination limited to rebuttal in trial of
guilt.</B> This section provides that any statements made by the
defendant to examining psychiatrists cannot be used as evidence
against him in a trial on the issue of guilt of the crime charged.
However, it is also provided that such evidence may be received
on the trial of the issued guilt of a murder charge to rebut
evidence of insanity offered by the defendant to reduce the
degree of murder. French v. District Court, 153 Colo. 10,
384 P.2d 268 (1963).</T>
   <P></P>
   <T>This section definitely prohibits the presentation of the
evidence obtained by experts during the period of observation,
until evidence has been brought forward by defendant placing
in issue, by testimony, the question of mental capacity. The
entry of a plea of not guilty by reason of insanity does not
destroy the presumption of sanity with which all persons are
clothed. Under this section the evidence obtained during the
period of observation should not have been received upon the
direct case of the people on the trial of the issue of guilt
and the cause is remanded for a new trial upon all issues
raised by the plea. Leick v. People, 131 Colo. 353, 281
P.2d 806 (1955).</T>
   <P></P>
   <T>
    <B>The limitation in this section on the admission of evidence applies only to the
guilt phase of a trial</B> and does not speak to the penalty phase or a postconviction
proceeding. Dunlap v. People, 173 P.3d 1054 (Colo. 2007), cert. denied, 552 U.S. 1105,
128
S. Ct. 882, 169 L. Ed. 2d 740 (2008).</T>
   <P></P>
   <T>
    <B>Nothing in this section prohibits</B> the prosecution from calling the
examining psychiatrist to give an opinion based on information derived from
other sources, provided that such evidence was not acquired directly or
indirectly for the first time from a communication made during the course of
a court-ordered examination. People v. Saiz,
923 P.2d 197 (Colo. App. 1995).</T>
   <P></P>
   <T>
    <B>Prosecution's antisocial personality disorder evidence properly admitted as
relevant evidence.</B> Prosecution's rebuttal of a defendant's insanity defense is not
limited solely to presenting evidence that directly disproves the disorder claimed by
defendant. Rather, the prosecution may present alternative explanations of a defendant's
behavior. People v. Gonzales-Quevedo, 203 P.3d 609 (Colo. App. 2008).</T>
   <P></P>
   <T>
    <B>Use of defendant's statements to hospital employee while confined for
sanity examination to rebut defendant's self-defense theory</B> did not
constitute reversible error as defendant failed to properly object to
hospital employee's testimony at trial and fact that testimony was given in
prosecution's case-in-chief rather than as rebuttal testimony did not
constitute plain error which would require consideration of issue not
raised at trial. People v. Kruse, 839 P.2d 1 (Colo. 1992).</T>
   <P></P>
   <T>
    <B>Expert testimony concerning the nature of the condition</B>
of minimal brain dysfunction, and its relation to poor impulse
control and lack of willpower, is admissible in evidence and
relevant to the issue of the defendant's sanity.
People v. Wright, 648 P.2d 665 (Colo. 1982).</T>
   <P></P>
   <T>
    <B>Trial court not required to give limiting instruction sua sponte.</B> Court is
required to give jury limiting instruction on use of expert testimony only at the request of
either party. People v. Grant, 174 P.3d 798 (Colo. App. 2007).</T>
   <P></P>
   <T>
    <B>Trial court has discretion to determine order in which evidence will
be presented at the sanity trial.</B> People v. Osborn, 42 Colo. App. 376,
599 P.2d 937 (1979).</T>
   <P></P>
   <T>
    <B>Opinion based on information of third persons not
testifying inadmissible.</B> A physician cannot express an
opinion based in whole or in part upon information obtained
from third persons who have not testified to the facts, and
the admission of such evidence was reversible error. Ingles
v. People, 90 Colo. 51, 6 P.2d 455 (1931).</T>
   <P></P>
   <T>An expert witness is not permitted to give an opinion of sanity
based upon information obtained from third persons who have not
testified. Garrison v. People, 158 Colo. 348, 408 P.2d 60 (1965).</T>
   <P></P>
   <T>
    <B>Exception if opinion not based on such information.</B> A doctor
is not disqualified to express his opinion concerning the sanity of a
defendant merely because he had some information from a source outside
his own examination if his opinion was not in any manner based on
that information. Garrison v. People, 158 Colo. 348, 408 P.2d 60 (1965).</T>
   <P></P>
   <T>
    <B>Doctor-patient privilege was not violated by court-appointed
psychiatrist's testimony</B> where the prosecution called him as a witness
to rebut evidence introduced by defendant which tended to show that he was
incapable of forming a specific intent. People v. Scheidt, 182 Colo. 374,
513 P.2d 446 (1973).</T>
   <P></P>
   <T>
    <B>Admissions to privately retained psychiatrist privileged.</B>
The prosecution may not call, as a witness in its case-in-chief, a psychiatrist
privately retained by the defendant in connection with an insanity plea
and elicit from the psychiatrist incriminating admissions made by the defendant
during a sanity examination. People v. Rosenthal, 617 P.2d 551 (Colo. 1980).</T>
   <P></P>
   <T>
    <B>Prosecutor entitled to physician's information.</B>
Where the confessions and admissions of the defendant have
been weighed by the examining physician in evaluating the
defendant's sanity, fairness requires that the prosecutor have
the same information as the defense attorney.
Lewis v. Thulemeyer, 189 Colo. 139, 538 P.2d 441 (1975).</T>
   <P></P>
   <T>Section only requires a limiting instruction "at the request of either party".
People v. Freeman, 47 P.3d 700 (Colo. App. 2001).</T>
   <P></P>
   <T>
    <B>Subsection (3)(b) is not limited to evidence of a defendant's condition during the
offense and it contains no exception for evidence of a post-incident condition.</B> Trial
court properly ruled that expert testimony related to defendant's mental condition and that
defendant would have to comply with the provisions of subsection (3)(b) if he wished to
have the experts testify. People v. Roadcap, 78 P.3d 1108 (Colo. App. 2003).</T>
   <P></P>
   <T>
    <B>This section does not preclude a defendant from calling expert witnesses,</B> it
merely requires defendant to comply with subsection (3)(b) if he chooses to pursue this
line of defense. People v. Roadcap, 78 P.3d 1108 (Colo. App. 2003).</T>
   <P></P>
   <T>
    <B>A defendant who has not pleaded insanity but seeks to plead a mental condition
defense demonstrates "good cause" for delay under subsection (3)(b) when</B> justice is
best served by permitting the introduction of evidence regarding a defendant's mental
condition and notice was not given at the time of arraignment due to mistake, ignorance,
or inadvertence. When considering whether good cause has been shown, courts should
construe subsection (3)(b) liberally in the defendant's favor. People v. Gilbert, 2020 COA
137, -- P.3d --.</T>
   <P></P>
   <T>
    <B>"Mental condition" includes</B> expert testimony offered to show how
defendant's intellectual or developmental disability affects the reliability or credibility of
statements made to police. People v. Flippo, 159 P.3d 100 (Colo. 2007).</T>
   <P></P>
   <T>
    <B>Learning disability such as a disorder of written expression is outside of the
statutory definition of "insanity".</B> Therefore, evidence of defendant's learning
disability to prove a mistake of fact is admissible without an insanity plea as long as
defendant provides notice and permits a court-ordered examination. People v. Wilburn,
2012 CO 21, 272 P.3d 1078.</T>
   <P></P>
   <T>
    <B>A defendant charged with a specific intent crime cannot introduce evidence that
shows, as a result of a mental disease or defect, the defendant was incapable of forming
the requisite culpable mental state unless</B> the defendant enters a plea of not guilty by
reason of insanity. Evidence that a defendant is incapable of forming the requisite
culpable mental state as a result of a mental disease or defect is relevant to the issue of
insanity. People v. Rosas, 2020 CO 22, 459 P.3d 540.</T>
   <P></P>
   <T>
    <B>Trial court did not err in denying defendant's motion to present evidence of his
mental state without pleading not guilty by reason of insanity.</B> Defendant proffered
evidence that tended to show he was incapable of accurately comprehending the
surrounding circumstances and of making a reasoned decision about an appropriate
course of action and that otherwise fell within the statutory definition of insanity. People
v. Gonzales-Quevedo, 203 P.3d 609 (Colo. App. 2008).</T>
   <P></P>
   <T>
    <B>A defendant may not call an expert witness to generally testify about a mental
condition without having undergone a court-ordered examination pursuant to §
16-8-106.</B> People v. Lane, 2014 COA 48, 343 P.3d 1019.</T>
   <P></P>
   <T>
    <B>Psychiatrist's testimony that defendant knew his actions were wrong violates
subsections (1)(a) and (1.5)(a) and defendant's right against self-incrimination.</B> The
testimony was not confined to a court-ordered sanity examination of whether defendant
had the capacity to distinguish right from wrong or form the culpable mental state at the
time of the offense. People v. Marko, 2015 COA 139, 434 P.3d 618, aff'd, 2018 CO 97,
432 P.3d 607.</T>
   <P></P>
   <T>The error does not require reversal because: the statements were few and relatively
inconspicuous in the context of the psychiatrist's testimony; the prosecution only used the
psychiatrist's testimony in closing arguments in relation to the plea of not guilty by
reason of insanity, not the defendant's guilt; and the prosecution presented substantial
evidence that the defendant knew his actions were wrong. People v. Marko, 2015 COA
139, 434 P.3d 618, aff'd, 2018 CO 97, 432 P.3d 607.</T>
   <P></P>
   <T>
    <B>Prosecution can introduce evidence obtained in court-ordered evaluation of
defendant pursuant to defendant's withdrawn insanity plea as evidence of defendant's
"mental condition" relating to his subsequent involuntary intoxication defense.</B>
Defendant's mental health examination was triggered by his initial claims of insanity.
Court did not err in allowing prosecution to call the experts to testify in accordance with
their previously produced reports to rebut testimony identified in the defendant's expert
disclosures. The experts were not required to conduct additional examinations of the sole
purpose of reissuing their original reports. People v. Herdman, 2012 COA 89, 310 P.3d
170.</T>

psychologist, or other expert of his own choice in connection with any proceeding under
this article, the court, upon timely motion, shall order that the examiner chosen by the
defendant be given reasonable opportunity to conduct the examination. An interview
conducted pursuant to a court order under this section must be video and audio recorded
and preserved. The court shall advise the defendant that any examination with a
psychiatrist or forensic psychologist may be audio and video recorded. A copy of the
recording must be provided to the prosecution with the examination report. Any jail or
other facility where the court orders the examination to take place must permit the
recording to occur and must provide the space and equipment necessary for such
recording, if available. If space and equipment are not available, the sheriff or facility
director shall attempt to coordinate a location and the availability of equipment with the
court, which may consult with the district attorney and defense counsel for an agreed
upon location. If no agreement is reached, and upon the request of either the defense
counsel or district attorney, the court shall order the location of the examination, which
may include the Colorado mental health institute at Pueblo.</M>

determination is made and documented contemporaneously in writing, the psychiatrist or
forensic psychologist shall not record the examination or shall cease recording the
examination, and the psychiatrist or forensic psychologist shall advise the court and the
parties of this determination and the reasons therefore in a written report to the court. If
only a partial recording is made, the psychiatrist or forensic psychologist shall provide
the partial recording to the court and the parties, and the partial recording may be used by
any psychiatrist or forensic psychologist in forming an opinion, submitting a report, or
testifying on the issue of the defendant's mental health.</M>

    <B>Nonexpert may not give hypothetical opinion of sanity.</B>
A nonexpert witness may never, in response to a purely
hypothetical question stating the facts, be permitted

testimony on a defendant's mental condition. People v. Giles, 192 Colo. 240,

   <P></P>
   <T>
    <B>The foundation to be laid under this section must indicate that the conclusions
of the witness bear directly upon the issue of sanity</B> and not merely conclusions
of fact as to conduct. People v. Medina, 185 Colo. 101, 521 P.2d 1257 (1974).</T>
   <P></P>
   <T>
    <B>Requirements which must be met before a lay witness can express his opinion as
to
the
sanity of another are:</B>
(1) It must be shown that the lay witness had an adequate means of becoming
acquainted with the person whose sanity is in issue; and (2) the contacts
must be proximate in time to the alleged offense. People v. Medina, 185 Colo. 101,
521 P.2d 1257 (1974).</T>
   <P></P>
   <T>Before opinion evidence from a nonexpert regarding
the sanity of another can be admissible, the specific facts upon which the opinion
is based must be first stated by the witness, and his testimony
must also show a close or intimate relationship with the party alleged to
be insane. People v. Medina, 185 Colo. 101, 521 P.2d 1257 (1974).</T>
   <P></P>
   <T>Before a lay witness is permitted to state an opinion
regarding the sanity or insanity or mental competence or
incompetence of a person whose mental condition is at issue, the witness
must have had ample opportunity to observe the speech, manner, habits, or conduct
of the person. People v. Medina, 185 Colo. 101, 521 P.2d 1257 (1974).</T>
   <P></P>
   <T>One who
in the opinion of a trial court shows adequate means of becoming
acquainted with a person whose mental condition is in issue,
after detailing the facts and circumstances concerning his
acquaintance and the acts and conversations upon which his
conclusion is based, may give his opinion on the question of
sanity. Leick v. People, 136 Colo. 535, 322 P.2d 674, cert.
denied, 357 U.S. 922, 78 S. Ct. 1363, 2 L. Ed. 2d 1366 (1958);
Rupert v. People, 163 Colo. 219, 429 P.2d 276 (1967).</T>
   <P></P>
   <T>The opinion of a nonexpert is admissible only when it is
made to appear that his acquaintance with a defendant, whose
sanity is in issue, had the requisite nearness in time after
the act charged, to persuade the court, in the exercise of
a sound discretion, to receive it. Leick v. People, 136 Colo.
535, 322 P.2d 674, cert. denied, 357 U.S. 922, 78 S. Ct. 1363,

   <T>The necessary predicate for lay opinion evidence is a showing
of adequate means to have become acquainted with the person
whose mental condition is at issue.
People v. Giles, 192 Colo. 240, 557 P.2d 408 (1976).</T>
   <P></P>
   <T>A lay witness may give an opinion relative to the defendant's sanity if
the witness details the facts which demonstrate his acquaintance with the
defendant, and if those facts demonstrate that the acquaintance is close
and that contacts were maintained at a point proximate in time to the alleged
offense. People v. Osborn, 42 Colo. App. 376, 599 P.2d 937 (1979).</T>
   <P></P>
   <T>
    <B>Discretion of trial judge.</B> Trial judges have very
broad discretion in determining whether or not any proffered
witness is qualified to give opinion testimony.

   <P></P>
   <T>
    <B>The testimony of a corrections officer who observed defendant during
defendant's pre-trial incarceration</B> had proper foundation.
The record indicates that the witness testified concerning the witness's
observations of defendant's behavior, not concerning the
witness's opinion of defendant's mental condition.
This testimony is specifically permitted by this section.
People v. Henderson, 794 P.2d 1050 (Colo. App. 1990),
rev'd on other grounds, 810 P.2d 1058 (Colo. 1991).</T>
   <P></P>
   <T>
    <B>When discretion abused.</B>
Where foundation testimony fails to conform and where the proper
guidelines are not adhered to in judging these requirements, it must be held
that the trial court abused its discretion in permitting the admission
of nonexpert opinion testimony. People v. Medina, 185 Colo. 101, 521 P.2d 1257
(1974).</T>
   <P></P>
   <T>
    <B>Court abused its discretion in admitting some lay opinions from mental health
providers who had not been properly noticed as experts by the prosecution.</B> Some
of the opinions were expert opinions improperly admitted under the guise of lay opinion
testimony. The improper testimony related to symptoms of specific mental illness and
opinions about whether defendant suffered from mental illness. The evidence relied
upon the witness's specialized knowledge and training and, therefore, went beyond the
bounds of lay opinion. The error in this case was harmless since there was ample
evidence in addition to the improperly admitted opinions. Dunlap v. People, 173 P.3d
1054 (Colo. 2007), cert. denied, 552 U.S. 1105, 128 S. Ct. 882, 169 L. Ed. 2d 740

verdict of not guilty by reason of insanity or not guilty by reason of impaired mental
condition.</M>
  </CATCH-LINE>
(1)<M>The court may order a release hearing at any time on its own motion, on motion
of
the prosecuting attorney, or on motion of the defendant. The court shall order a release
hearing upon receipt of the report of the chief officer of the institution in which the
defendant
is committed that the defendant no longer requires hospitalization, as provided in section
16-8-116, or upon motion of the defendant made after one hundred eighty-two days
following the date of the initial commitment order. Except for the first hearing following
the
initial commitment order, unless the court for good cause shown permits, the defendant is
not
entitled to a hearing within one year subsequent to a previous hearing.</M>
  <P N="(1.5)(a)"></P>
  <T>(1.5)<N></N>(a)<M>Any victim of any crime or any member of such victim's immediate
family, if the victim has died or is a minor, the perpetrator of which has been
found not
guilty by reason of insanity or not guilty by reason of impaired mental
condition, shall be notified by the court in a timely manner prior to any
hearing for release of the perpetrator held pursuant to subsection (1) of
this section, if such victim or family member can reasonably be located.
This paragraph (a) shall apply only to offenses committed before July 1, 1995.</M>
  </T>
  <P N="(1.5)(b)"></P>
  <T>(b)<M>Any victim of any crime or any member of such victim's
immediate family, if the victim has died or is a minor, the
perpetrator of which has been found not guilty by reason of
insanity, shall be notified by the court in a timely manner prior
to any hearing for release of the perpetrator held pursuant to
subsection (1) of this section, if such victim or family member
can reasonably be located. This paragraph (b) shall apply to
offenses committed on or after July 1, 1995.</M>
  </T>
  <P N="(2)(a)"></P>
  <T>(2)<N></N>(a)<M>The court shall order a release examination of the defendant when a
current one has not already been furnished or when either the prosecution or defense
moves for an examination of the defendant at a different institution or by different
experts. The court may order any additional or supplemental examination, investigation,
or study that it deems necessary to a proper consideration and determination of the
question of eligibility for release. The court shall set the matter for release hearing after it
has received all of the reports that it has ordered under this section. When none of said
reports indicates that the defendant is eligible for release, the defendant's request for
release hearing shall be denied by the court if the defendant is unable to show by way of
an offer of proof any evidence by a medical expert in mental disorders that would
indicate
that the defendant is eligible for release. For the purposes of this subsection (2), "medical
expert in mental disorders" means a physician licensed under the provisions of article
240
of title 12, a psychologist licensed under the provisions of article 245 of title 12, a
psychiatric technician licensed under the provisions of article 295 of title 12, a registered
professional nurse as defined in section 12-255-104 (11), who by reason of postgraduate
education and additional nursing preparation has gained knowledge, judgment, and skill
in psychiatric or mental health nursing, or a social worker licensed under the provisions
of
part 4 of article 245 of title 12. The release hearing shall be to the court or, on demand by
the defendant, to a jury of not to exceed six persons. At the release hearing, if any
evidence of insanity is introduced, the defendant has the burden of proving restoration of
sanity by a preponderance of the evidence; if any evidence of ineligibility for release by
reason of impaired mental condition is introduced, the defendant has the burden of
proving, by a preponderance of the evidence, that the defendant is eligible for release by
no longer having an impaired mental condition. This subsection (2)(a) shall apply only to
offenses committed before July 1, 1995.</M>

and
additional nursing preparation has gained knowledge, judgment, and skill in psychiatric
or
mental health nursing, or a social worker licensed under the provisions of part 4 of article
245 of title 12. The release hearing shall be to the court or, on demand by the defendant,
to a jury composed of not more than six persons. At the release hearing, if any evidence
that the defendant does not meet the release criteria is introduced, the defendant has the
burden of proving by a preponderance of the evidence that the defendant has no
abnormal
mental condition that would be likely to cause the defendant to be dangerous either to
himself or herself or to others or to the community in the reasonably foreseeable future.
This subsection (2)(b) shall apply to offenses committed on or after July 1, 1995.</M>

  <T>(3)<N></N>(a)<M>If the
court or jury finds the defendant eligible for release, the court may impose
such terms and conditions as the court determines are in the best interests of
the defendant and the community, and the jury shall be so instructed. If the
court or jury finds the defendant ineligible for release, the court shall
recommit the defendant. The court's
order placing the defendant on conditional release shall include
notice that the defendant's conditional release may be revoked
pursuant to the provisions of section 16-8-115.5.</M>

terms and conditions of such release to the executive director of
the department of human services and to the
director of any community mental health center which may be charged with
continued treatment of the defendant. The director of such mental
health center shall make written reports every three months to the
executive director of the department of human
services and to the district attorney for the judicial district
where the defendant was committed and to the district attorney for
any judicial district where the defendant may be required to
receive treatment concerning the treatment and status of the
defendant. Such reports shall include all known violations of the
terms and conditions of the defendant's release and any changes
in the defendant's mental status which would indicate that the
defendant has become ineligible to remain on conditional release
as defined in section 16-8-102 (4.5).</M>
  </T>
  <P N="(3)(c)"></P>
  <T>(c)<M>A defendant who has been conditionally released remains
under the supervision of the department of human
services until the committing court enters a final order of
unconditional release. When a defendant fails to comply with any
conditions of his release requiring him to establish, maintain,
and reside at a specific residence and his whereabouts have
therefore become unknown to the authorities charged with his
supervision or when the defendant leaves the state of Colorado
without the consent of the committing court, the defendant's
absence from supervision shall constitute escape, as defined in
section 18-8-208, C.R.S. Such offense occurs in the county in
which the defendant is authorized to reside.</M>

register with the local law enforcement agency of the jurisdiction in which the defendant
resides if the court finds that the chief officer of the institution in which the defendant

of the city, town, or city and county. If the defendant plans to reside outside of such
corporate limits, the defendant shall register at the office of the county sheriff of the

treatment issues. Garcia v. Carmel, 873 P.2d 1317 (Colo. 1994).</T>
   <P></P>
   <T>But no other circumstances are set forth in the statutes relating to the committing
court's
jurisdiction after the order of commitment is entered, and thus there is no jurisdiction
over
issues
involving the return of seized property. People v. Galves, 955 P.2d 582 (Colo. App.
1997).</T>
   <P></P>
   <T>
    <B>Probation, recommitment, and transfer are discretionary acts
clothed with governmental immunity.</B> Where the trial judge had
continuing jurisdiction under Colorado law both over appellant
upon his commitment to a state hospital following acquittal on
grounds of insanity and his transfer to the state penitentiary and
over the subject matter involved, the doctrine of judicial
immunity is applicable to the judge against allegations of
violations of the civil rights act. The supervision of the state
hospital and the staff psychiatrist were also clothed with governmental
immunity because the revocation of probation, recommitment, and transfer
were discretionary in nature. Franklin v. Meredith, 386 F.2d 958
(10th Cir. 1967).</T>
   <P></P>
   <T>
    <B>Implied authority to order recommitment.</B> The
statutory authority to issue a conditional release order
necessarily and implicitly includes the authority to
enforce that order by recommitment. Campbell v. District Court, 195 Colo. 304,
577 P.2d 1096 (1978).</T>
   <P></P>
   <T>
    <B>Automatic commitment not denial of due process.</B>
A defendant acquitted by reason of insanity is not denied due process of
law by an immediate and automatic commitment to a psychiatric facility,
so long as there are available to him procedures similar to those in this
section. People v. Chavez, 629 P.2d 1040 (Colo. 1981).</T>
   <P></P>
   <T>
    <B>Nor is six-month initial commitment period.</B>
Given the uncertainties and variables of psychiatric diagnosis and prognosis,
the legislative choice of a six-month period of initial commitment does
not violate due process, for in the absence of a showing that the time fixed
is unreasonable in length and unrelated to purpose a court must defer to
the general assembly's decision. People v. Chavez, 629 P.2d 1040 (Colo. 1981);
Glatz v. Kort, 650 F. Supp. 191 (D. Colo. 1984), aff'd, 807 F.2d 1514 (10th Cir. 1986).</T>
   <P></P>
   <T>
    <B>Defendant's liberty interest not violated by requirement in subsection (4)(a) that
he register as a sex offender as a condition of his conditional release</B> since the
requirement was in place prior to his conditional release. People v. Durapau, 12 COA 67, 280
P.3d 42.</T>
   <P></P>
   <T>
    <B>Since sex offender registration is not punitive,</B> requiring an offender who
pled not guilty by reason of insanity to register as a sex offender upon his or her
conditional release does not violate the principles of ex post facto. People v. Durapau, 12
COA 67, 280 P.3d 42.</T>
   <P></P>
   <T>
    <B>Release conditioned by criminal probation denies due process.</B>
A judgment which places one adjudged not guilty by reason of insanity
on criminal probation or, on his refusal to accept such terms, remands
him to indefinite custody violates his fourteenth amendment rights
under the United States constitution. Such a commitment is an invalid deprivation
of liberty without due process. Scheidt v. Meredith, 307 F. Supp. 63
(D. Colo. 1970).</T>
   <P></P>
   <T>
    <B>As such conditions may not be imposed on one not convicted of
crime.</B> Criminal probation is designed for the guilty and not for
those who are not guilty. An essential requirement is an adjudication
of guilt, and punitive aspects are clearly involved. The conditions
imposed upon a person who has been granted probationary release under
this section are, as a matter of practice, the same conditions imposed
upon a convicted criminal who has been placed on probation. The
imposition of such conditions on one who has not been convicted of
a crime is unconstitutional. Scheidt v. Meredith, 307 F. Supp. 63
(D. Colo. 1970).</T>
   <P></P>
   <T>
    <B>Unrelated criminal probationary conditions unconstitutional.</B>
The imposition of criminal probationary conditions which are not
related to the individual seeking release are unconstitutional.
Campbell v. District Court, 195 Colo. 304,
577 P.2d 1096 (1978).</T>
   <P></P>
   <T>
    <B>Conditional release of one restored to sanity may not be
conditioned on terms having no relation to his status</B> and which
were nonresponsive or irrelevant to the judgment of not guilty by
reason of insanity. Scheidt v. Meredith, 307 F. Supp. 63 (D. Colo. 1970).</T>
   <P></P>
   <T>
    <B>Court may impose nonpunitive terms such as out-patient care.</B>
The interests of the community and the individual are relevant to the
granting of a conditional release. It would be clearly proper to require
that petitioner accept psychiatric out-patient care or supervision,
but, terms which were designed to regulate the activities of convicted
criminals, and which are punitive in nature, cannot be imposed. Scheidt v.
Meredith, 307 F. Supp. 63 (D. Colo. 1970).</T>
   <P></P>
   <T>
    <B>However, there is no per se prohibition against admission of evidence
concerning specific conditions of release.</B>
Rather, admissibility of evidence is to be determined within
framework of rules of relevance in rules of evidence. Vialpando v. People, 727
P.2d 1090 (Colo. 1986).</T>
   <P></P>
   <T>
    <B>Under subsection (3),</B> a defendant who is conditionally
released remains under the supervision of the department of institutions until
the committing court enters a final order of unconditional release. People v.
McCoy, 821 P.2d 873 (Colo. App. 1991).</T>
   <P></P>
   <T>
    <B>Writ of habeas corpus is a proper remedy</B>
for persons committed to a state hospital after a plea
of not guilty by reason of insanity to challenge a lack
of treatment and to obtain a remedy addressing appropriate
treatment short of immediate release. Marshall v. Kort,
690 P.2d 219 (Colo. 1984).</T>
   <P></P>
   <T>
    <B>Court may terminate release to order examination.</B> Inasmuch as
defendant had been away from the hospital on a probationary release, the
hospital authorities would almost have to reexamine him in order to determine
his present mental condition and the trial court could terminate probationary
release and return him to the hospital for the period of time necessary for
reexamination. Bartosik v. People, 163 Colo. 267, 430 P.2d 83 (1967).</T>
   <P></P>
   <T>
    <B>No broad right of discovery.</B> Based on this section and
§§ 16-8-116 and 16-8-117 and on the special nonadversary nature of a
release
inquiry,
the participants in release proceedings do not have the broad right
of discovery as provided in the rules of civil procedure.
People v. District Court, 192 Colo. 225, 557 P.2d 414 (1976).</T>
   <P></P>
   <T>Under C.R.C.P. 81(a), the procedure in release hearings under this
section is so inconsistent and in conflict with the rules of civil
procedure as to make civil discovery rules inapplicable to release hearings. People v.

   <P></P>
   <T>

People v. Hilton, 902 P.2d 883 (Colo. App. 1995).</T>
   <P></P>
   <T>
    <B>Trial court acted properly in shifting burden of proving eligibility for
release to the defendant</B> where state introduced evidence that defendant was
not eligible for release because he had an abnormal mental condition.
People v. Hilton, 902 P.2d 883 (Colo. App. 1995).</T>
   <P></P>
   <T>
    <B>Burden of proof.</B> Where the superintendent
of the state hospital recommended the defendant's release from
commitment and a release hearing was held, but a jury denied
the defendant his release, and he appealed, the appellate
court reversed and remanded to the trial court with directions
to hold another hearing. The trial court asked the superintendent
for an updated report and this time the superintendent recommended
that the defendant remain committed. It was perfectly proper
for the trial court to order a reexamination of the defendant
in order to bring the evidence up to date. As a result the
superintendent rendered a contrary opinion, which the defendant
contested. Under the plain language of subsection (2)
the contestant defendant then had the burden of proof.
People v. District Court, 189 Colo. 151, 538 P.2d 469 (1975).</T>
   <P></P>
   <T>
    <B>Burden of proof on one seeking release.</B>
One who is contesting the recommendation of the custodial
institution has the burden of proving by a preponderance of the
evidence that he is not likely to be dangerous.
People v. Howell, 196 Colo. 408,
586 P.2d 27 (1978).</T>
   <P></P>
   <T>
    <B>It is not unconstitutional to require defendant
to bear burden of proof</B> that he will not be dangerous
in the reasonably foreseeable future in a proceeding under this section.
People v. Logan, 196 Colo. 573,
588 P.2d 870 (1979).</T>
   <P></P>
   <T>
    <B>Allocation of burden of proof to defendant permissible.</B>
In a case of contested eligibility for release the statutory allocation
of the burden of proof is permissible because: (1) There will have been
a judicial determination of probable cause to believe that the defendant
committed the acts charged against him as a crime; (2) there will have been
an adjudication that at the time of the commission of the offense the defendant
was legally insane; and (3) the chief officer of the institution to which
the defendant has been committed will have found him ineligible for release
by reason of a mental disease or defect likely to cause him to be dangerous
to himself, to others, or to the community, in the reasonably foreseeable future.

   <P></P>
   <T>
    <B>Jury's entitlement to hear all competent evidence relevant to the ultimate
issue</B> in the case may include evidence that bears on the likelihood of

or to the community in the reasonably foreseeable future. Vialpando v.
People, 727 P.2d 1090 (Colo. 1986).</T>

   <P></P>
   <T>
    <B>Medical report prepared at the time of defendant's plea was not

in person, to examine any reports of examination or other matter to be considered by the
court as bearing upon the determination, to introduce evidence, summon witnesses,
cross-examine witnesses for the other side or the court, and to make opening and closing
statements and argument. The court may examine or cross-examine any witness called by
the defendant or prosecuting attorney and may summon and examine witnesses on its own

(1)<M>If any defendant, confined in an institution for the care and treatment of persons
with behavioral or mental health disorders or intellectual and developmental disabilities
under the supervision of the executive director of the department of human services,
escapes from such institution, it is the duty of the chief officer to apply forthwith to the
district court for the county in which the hospital or institution is located for a warrant of
arrest directed to the sheriff of the county, commanding him or her forthwith to take all
necessary legal action to effect the arrest of the defendant and to return him or her
promptly to the institution. The fact of an escape becomes a part of the official record of
a defendant and must be certified to the committing court as part of the record in any
proceeding to determine whether the defendant is eligible for release from commitment
or eligible for conditional release.</M>

to return the defendant to the institution from which he or she escaped. The chief officer
is further authorized to effect the return at the expense of the state of Colorado and under
such terms and conditions as the chief officer deems suitable.</M>

of
fair determination without the personal participation of the defendant. However, a

If the motion is made by the defense, the defense shall provide to the prosecution notice
of
the filing of the motion at the time of filing, and if the defense requests a hearing, the
defense
shall provide the motion to the prosecution at the time the hearing is requested. The

   <P></P>
   <T>
    <B>Common-law rule.</B> It has long been the rule of the
common law that a person cannot be required to plead to an
indictment or be tried for a crime while he is so mentally
disordered as to be incapable of making a rational defense,
and he cannot be adjudged to punishment or executed while
so disordered as to be incapable of stating any reasons
that may exist why judgment should not be pronounced
or executed. Hampton v. Tinsley, 240 F. Supp. 213
(D. Colo. 1965), rev'd on other grounds, 355 F.2d
470 (10th Cir. 1966).</T>
   <P></P>
   <T>The heart of the common-law doctrine has been that
a suggestion of incompetency after sentence is an appeal
to the conscience and sound wisdom of the particular
tribunal which is asked to postpone sentence. Leick v.
People, 140 Colo. 564, 345 P.2d 1054 (1959).</T>
   <P></P>
   <T>
    <B>This section is constitutional.</B> Leick v. People,
140 Colo. 564, 345 P.2d 1054 (1959).</T>
   <P></P>
   <T>This section is not unconstitutional as depriving
a convicted person of due process of law, proceedings
to determine competency after conviction being purely
a matter of legislative regulation and subject to such
restrictions as the general assembly may impose. Leick v.
People, 140 Colo. 564, 345 P.2d 1054 (1959).</T>
   <P></P>
   <T>
    <B>This section meets due process requirements of the fourteenth amendment.</B>
The section involves weighty governmental interest, and because of the significant
consequences to due process that an error in making the determination of mental
competency would have, the lower "reason to believe" standard is an appropriate
threshold for commencing the determination of mental competency. Cappelli v.
Demlow, 935 P.2d 57 (Colo. App. 1996).</T>
   <P></P>
   <T>
    <B>No fourteenth amendment equal protection clause violation</B> merely because
of the lower "reason to believe" threshold for criminal commitment statute versus a
probable cause standard of civil commitment statutes. Cappelli v. Demlow, 935 P.2d 57
(Colo. App. 1996).</T>
   <P></P>
   <T>
    <B>This section does not implicate the fourth amendment.</B> Cappelli v.
Demlow, 935 P.2d 57 (Colo. App. 1996).</T>
   <P></P>
   <T>
    <B>Purpose of this section</B> is to ensure against a violation of due process that
would arise if a defendant who is not mentally competent were required to stand trial or
participate in other critical criminal procedures. Schwader v. District Court, 172 Colo.
474, 474 P.2d 607 (1970); Cappelli v. Demlow, 935 P.2d 57 (Colo. App. 1996).</T>
   <P></P>
   <T>
    <B>Subsection (1) of former § 16-8-110 declared unconstitutional as violation
of due process to the extent that it allowed an accused to be tried on the issue of insanity
notwithstanding a judicial finding that the accused is incompetent to proceed.</B>
Coolbroth v. District Court, 766 P.2d 670 (Colo. 1988).</T>
   <P></P>
   <T>
    <B>Subsection (2)(b) requires a trial court to consider defense counsel's motion
raising competency without disclosing that motion to the prosecution.</B> People v.
Roina, 2019 CO 20, 437 P.3d 919.</T>
   <P></P>
   <T>
    <B>The plain language of the statute provides that the trial court may consider the
defense's ex parte competency motion when the defense raises competency and seeks a
preliminary finding as to competency.</B> People v. Roina, 2019 CO 20, 437 P.3d 919.</T>
   <P></P>
   <T>Defense counsel's sealed motion raising defendant's competency was a request for
the court to order an initial competency evaluation of the defendant. Subsection (2)(b)
requires trial courts to consider these motions even though they may be characterized as
ex parte communications. The trial court erred in determining that it could review the
defense's motion only if it provided a copy to the prosecution. People v. Roina, 2019 CO
20, 437 P.3d 919.</T>
   <P></P>
   <T>
    <B>The general assembly made clear in § 16-8.5-103 that there is a distinction
between the preliminary finding as to competency and the competency hearing.</B>
People v. Roina, 2019 CO 20, 437 P.3d 919.</T>
   <P></P>
   <T>

ordering the competency evaluation, the period during which the defendant was under
observation is excluded from the speedy trial calculation. People v. Nagi, 2014 COA 12,

   <P></P>
   <T>
    <B>Amnesia, in and of itself, does not constitute incompetency.</B> The trial court
should engage in a fact-specific inquiry that encompasses a review of the totality of the
circumstances of a particular case. Although the review may include considerations as to
a defendant's memory loss, no particular set of factors is determinative. If a defendant's
amnesia renders him or her unable to understand the proceedings against him or her or to
assist in his or her own defense, then the defendant must be found incompetent. People

503 P.2d 1029 (1972).</T>
   <P></P>
   <T>Insanity at the time of the commission of the offense
is not a mitigating factor that relieves the accused of
punishment, but is a complete defense to the criminal
charge, and therefore the determination of sanity at the
time of the offense requires a full hearing, and the
accused must be able to understand and assist his counsel
in his defense. Parks v. Denver District Court, 180 Colo. 202,

   <T>
    <B>Determination prior to preliminary hearing.</B> The
right to counsel is a meaningless right unless the defendant
has the capacity to confer with his attorney regarding the
pending charges and the testimony presented at the preliminary

made as to his competency prior to a preliminary hearing.

   <P></P>
   <T>
    <B>Showing necessary to "raise the issue" of a defendant's competency after trial
has
commenced.</B>
Where trial court had an opportunity to observe defendant during first day of trial and
noted
that
defendant understood her competency was being
addressed and, without prompting, stated she wanted to continue the
trial, defense counsel's assertion of defendant's condition of methadone withdrawal did
not
create a

1987).</T>
   <P></P>
   <T>
    <B>Mere statement at time of sentencing that defendant's behavior at the time of the

App. 1999).</T>
   <P></P>
   <T>
    <B>Court correctly ruled that the issue of competency had not been properly
raised</B> where defense counsel refused to give specific reasons to support
his opinion that the defendant was incompetent and refused the court's offer
of an in camera hearing on the issue, the court had ample opportunity to
observe the defendant, and the defendant ably assisted in his case. People

1993).</T>
   <P></P>
   <T>
    <B>And alleged condition arose after trial where issue was
found against him.</B> Where, after conviction, defendant asserts
that he is incompetent and asks that sentence be postponed,
his application should show that such incompetency arose
subsequent to conviction, especially where the question
as to defendant's insanity was at issue and found against
him in the main trial. People v. Eldred, 103 Colo. 334,
86 P.2d 248 (1938).</T>
   <P></P>
   <T>
    <B>But court may initiate determination on its own
motion.</B> A trial court may on its own motion, where it
entertains a reasonable doubt of a defendant's competence,
initiate a determination thereof, notwithstanding a
failure to plead such incompetency in accordance with
this section. Leick v. People, 136 Colo. 535, 322 P.2d
674, cert. denied, 357 U.S. 922, 78 S. Ct. 1363, 2 L. Ed. 2d 1366 (1958).</T>
   <P></P>
   <T>If the court, at any stage of the proceedings, has a
reasonable doubt whether the defendant is so mentally disordered,
it should suspend the criminal proceedings and hold an inquiry
on the matter. Hampton v. Tinsley, 240 F. Supp. 213
(D. Colo. 1965), rev'd on other grounds, 355 F.2d 470 (10th Cir. 1966).</T>
   <P></P>
   <T>
    <B>And it is duty bound to do so when competency doubtful.</B>
When the trial court has a doubt as to the mental competence of a
defendant, then the court is duty bound upon its own motion to
hold a competency hearing on the matter. Bresnahan v. People,
175 Colo. 286, 487 P.2d 551 (1971).</T>
   <P></P>
   <T>It is not only the duty of defense counsel and the prosecution,
but also the obligation of the court, to raise the issue of the
competency of an accused to stand trial when facts dictate that
such a hearing should be held. Parks v. Denver District Court, 180 Colo. 202,
503 P.2d 1029 (1972).</T>
   <P></P>
   <T>A trial court has an independent obligation to raise the issue of a defendant's
competency
at any stage of a criminal proceeding if the court has reason to believe that he or she is
incompetent. People v. Hendricks, 972 P.2d 1041 (Colo. App. 1998),

   <P></P>
   <T>
    <B>Court and counsel to raise issue whenever competency in doubt.</B>
When a doubt is entertained about the mental competence of an accused, both
the court and counsel are duty bound to raise the issue and seek a reliable
determination of it before further proceedings are held. Jones v. District
Court, 617 P.2d 803 (Colo. 1980).</T>
   <P></P>
   <T>
    <B>And court's refusal to inquire possible abuse of discretion.</B>
Where defense attorney's representation to the court raised a substantial
issue on the defendant's competency to stand trial, the trial court's refusal
to make any inquiry into that issue or to receive any evidence in that regard
constituted an abuse of discretion. Jones v. District Court,
617 P.2d 803 (Colo. 1980).</T>
   <P></P>
   <T>
    <B>Failure to hold hearing on claimed incompetence violates due process.</B>
Due process is violated when a trial court does not afford an accused an adequate hearing
on
his
claimed incompetency to stand trial.
People v. Matthews, 662 P.2d 1108 (Colo. App. 1983).</T>
   <P></P>
   <T>
    <B>But, when a court can conduct a meaningful hearing retrospectively to evaluate
the competency of a defendant, such competency hearings do not violate due process
principles.</B> In determining whether a meaningful hearing can be held, a court should
consider: (1) the passage of time; (2) the availability of contemporaneous medical
evidence, including medical records and prior competency determinations; (3)
defendant's statements in the trial record; and (4) the availability of individuals and
witnesses who interacted with the defendant before and during trial, including the trial
judge, both counsel, and jail officials. People v. Corichi, 18 P.3d 807 (Colo. App. 2000).</T>
   <P></P>
   <T>
    <B>Even where competence issue raised by court.</B>
That the issue of defendant's competency is raised by the trial court, and not by the
defendant's
counsel, or by his advisory counsel, does not result in a weakening of the imperative that
he
be
afforded an adequate hearing on his competency.
People v. Matthews, 662 P.2d 1108 (Colo. App. 1983).</T>
   <P></P>
   <T>
    <B>And retrospective determination of competency does not cure the failure.</B>
The trial court's noncompliance with those statutory procedures set forth
in this section and § 16-8-111, which provide those safeguards necessary
to insure against the prosecution of an
incompetent defendant, constitutes error so prejudicial as to be characterized as one of
constitutional deprivation.
Retrospective determination of the defendant's mental competency during his trial will
not
cure
the error.
People v. Matthews, 662 P.2d 1108 (Colo. App. 1983).</T>
   <P></P>
   <T>
    <B>Motions to determine competency must include threshold requirements and trial
courts retain sufficient discretion to reject the rare competency motion that rests on
counsel's inadequate proffer.</B> Under the totality of the circumstances, including the
competency motion filed by defendant's counsel that was bereft of specific facts
supporting a good-faith doubt regarding defendant's competency, the trial court did not
abuse its discretion in rejecting the motion as inadequate. People v. Lindsey, 2020 CO
21, 459 P.3d 530.</T>
   <P></P>
   <T>
    <B>When duty to suspend proceeding arises.</B>
The duty in subsection (2)(a) to suspend the proceedings arises even if no more than a
"doubt" is
entertained as to a defendant's competency.
People v. Scherrer, 670 P.2d 18 (Colo. App. 1983).</T>
   <P></P>
   <T>
    <B>Determination may be initiated at any time.</B> Where
no proper allegation of incompetency relating to a time subsequent
to the alleged offense is entered, and nothing in the record prompts
the court to move in the matter, no prejudice results to a defendant,
since such proceedings may be initiated at any time. Leick v. People,
136 Colo. 535, 322 P.2d 674 (1958).</T>
   <P></P>
   <T>
    <B>Question of competency may be raised at any time,</B> but, if possible,

   <P></P>
   <T>
    <B>Prohibition proper to prevent criminal proceedings in violation
of section.</B> When a trial court and county court, before preliminary
hearing, plea or arraignment, lose authority under this section to proceed
further with criminal proceedings due to incompetency of defendant,
for a district court to certify the cause back to the county court for
further criminal proceedings is to act in excess of its jurisdiction, and
the remedy of prohibition is appropriate to prevent further proceedings.

   <P></P>
   <T>
    <B>Competency hearing was unnecessary.</B> Where the results of
commitment indicated that defendant was sane, though quite emotionally
disturbed, that his intelligence level was above average, and that his
thinking processes were clear and logical, and defendant's testimony
at the rule 35(b), Crim. P. hearing and his letters to his attorney
and to his relatives pending disposition of the case in the trial
court show that defendant's thoughts and expression of the same were
above average in quality and content for a person of his years, there
is no reason for the trial court to have had any doubt as to defendant's
competency and to have held a competency hearing on its own motion.

   <T>
    <B>Purpose of this section</B> is to ensure against a violation of due process that

    <B>Section 16-8.5-102 (2)(b) requires a trial court to consider defense counsel's
motion raising competency without disclosing that motion to the prosecution.</B>
People v. Roina, 2019 CO 20, 437 P.3d 919.</T>
   <P></P>
   <T>
    <B>The plain language of that section provides that the trial court may consider the
defense's ex parte competency motion when the defense raises competency and seeks a
preliminary finding as to competency.</B> People v. Roina, 2019 CO 20, 437 P.3d 919.</T>
   <P></P>
   <T>Defense counsel's sealed motion raising defendant's competency was a request for
the court to order an initial competency evaluation of the defendant. Section 16-8.5-102
(2)(b) requires trial courts to consider these motions even though they may be
characterized as ex parte communications. The trial court erred in determining that it
could review the defense's motion only if it provided a copy to the prosecution. People v.
Roina, 2019 CO 20, 437 P.3d 919.</T>
   <P></P>
   <T>
    <B>The general assembly made clear in this section that there is a distinction

   <T>
    <B>Court needs not await a specific request from defense.</B> People v. Thomas,
962
P.2d 263 (Colo. App. 1997).</T>
   <P></P>
   <T>Trial court acted properly in ordering competency evaluation based on a pretrial
motion
that raised doubts as to defendant's competency, then allowing testimony by evaluating
doctor to rebut defendant's claim of lack of mental capacity. People v. Thomas, 962 P.2d
263 (Colo. App. 1997).</T>
   <P></P>
   <T>
    <B>Showing necessary to "raise the issue" of a defendant's competency after
trial has commenced.</B>
Where trial court had an opportunity to observe defendant during first day of
trial and noted that defendant understood her competency was being addressed
and, without prompting, stated she wanted to continue the
trial, defense counsel's assertion of defendant's condition of methadone
withdrawal did not create a reason to presume mental incompetency. People v.
Morino, 743 P.2d 49 (Colo. App. 1987).</T>
   <P></P>
   <T>
    <B>The trial court's statement that defendant's motion for a competency
hearing was a "ploy" to delay the trial</B> was adequately supported by what
the judge learned in his judicial capacity during argument on pretrial
motions
concerning the defendant's competency, and such a statement does not
constitute the kind of prejudice required for recusal. People v. Seigler,
832 P.2d 980 (Colo. App. 1991), cert denied, 846 P.2d 189 (Colo. 1993).</T>
   <P></P>
   <T>
    <B>Court correctly ruled that the issue of competency had not been properly
raised</B> where defense counsel refused to give specific reasons to support
his opinion that the defendant was incompetent and refused the court's offer
of an in camera hearing on the issue, the court had ample opportunity to
observe the defendant, and the defendant ably assisted in his case. People
v. Seigler, 832 P.2d 980 (Colo. App. 1991), cert denied, 846 P.2d 189 (Colo.
1993).</T>
   <P></P>
   <T>
    <B>Determination of issue of insanity after sentence does
not require safeguards of a judicial proceeding,</B> since it
relates to the consequences of the offense and not to the guilt
of a defendant. Leick v. People, 140 Colo. 564, 345 P.2d 1054 (1959).</T>
   <P></P>
   <T>
    <B>Trial of incompetent violates due process.</B>
Subjecting an accused to trial when he or she is incompetent violates due process of law.
People v. Matthews, 662 P.2d 1108 (Colo. App. 1983).</T>
   <P></P>
   <T>
    <B>Trial of an incompetent defendant constitutes structural error and requires
reversal.</B> People v. Mondragon, 217 P.3d 936 (Colo. App. 2009).</T>
   <P></P>
   <T>
    <B>Failure to hold hearing on claimed incompetence violates due process.</B>
Due process is violated when a trial court does not afford an accused an adequate hearing
on
his
or her claimed incompetency to stand trial.
People v. Matthews, 662 P.2d 1108 (Colo. App. 1983).</T>
   <P></P>
   <T>
    <B>But, when a court can conduct a meaningful hearing retrospectively to evaluate
the competency of a defendant, such competency hearings do not violate due process
principles.</B> In determining whether a meaningful hearing can be held, a court should
consider: (1) the passage of time; (2) the availability of contemporaneous medical
evidence, including medical records and prior competency determinations; (3)
defendant's statements in the trial record; and (4) the availability of individuals and
witnesses who interacted with the defendant before and during trial, including the trial
judge, both counsel, and jail officials. People v. Corichi, 18 P.3d 807 (Colo. App. 2000).</T>
   <P></P>
   <T>
    <B>Even where competence issue raised by court.</B>
That the issue of defendant's competency is raised by the trial court, and not by the
defendant's
counsel, or by his advisory counsel, does not result in a weakening of the imperative that
he
be
afforded an adequate hearing on his competency.
People v. Matthews, 662 P.2d 1108 (Colo. App. 1983).</T>
   <P></P>
   <T>
    <B>Prohibition against prosecuting incompetent defendant is not restricted

617 P.2d 803 (Colo. 1980).</T>
   <P></P>
   <T>
    <B>Court to make inquiry where substantial issue as to competency.</B>
Where defense attorney's representation to the court raised a substantial
issue as to the defendant's competency to stand trial, trial court's refusal
to make any inquiry into that issue or to receive any evidence in that regard
constituted an abuse of discretion. Jones v. District Court,
617 P.2d 803 (Colo. 1980).</T>
   <P></P>
   <T>
    <B>It relates to a reprieve.</B> Postponement of execution
because of incompetency bears a close affinity not to trial for
a crime, but rather to reprieves of sentences in general. Leick
v. People, 140 Colo. 564, 345 P.2d 1054 (1959).</T>

   <T>The burden is upon the petitioner alleging incompetency to
produce sufficient evidence to overcome the presumption of validity
and regularity surrounding entry of his plea of guilty. Hampton v.
Tinsley, 240 F. Supp. 213 (D. Colo. 1965), rev'd on other grounds,
355 F.2d 470 (10th Cir. 1966).</T>
   <P></P>
   <T>The burden is on defendant to prove incompetency by a preponderance
of the evidence under pretrial statutory procedure, when a defendant
raises the issue of incompetency after the alleged commission of the
crime. Gomez v. District Court, 179 Colo. 299,
500 P.2d 134 (1972).</T>
   <P></P>
   <T>
    <B>Standards for assessing accused's incompetency.</B>
An accused's competency must be assessed with specific reference to the
nature of the proceeding with which he is confronted and the appropriate
level of understanding necessary for meaningful cooperation with his attorney.
Jones v. District Court, 617 P.2d 803 (Colo. 1980).</T>
   <P></P>
   <T>
    <B>And must allow defendant time to request hearing.</B>
Trial court exceeded its jurisdiction when it made a preliminary finding
of competency and simultaneously ordered the petitioner's attorney to present
his motions on capital punishment issues without affording the petitioner
the opportunity, within a time designated by the court, to request a statutory
hearing on a final determination of competency in accordance with this section.
Jones v. District Court, 617 P.2d 803 (Colo. 1980).</T>
   <P></P>
   <T>A final determination of competency cannot be made by a trial court without first
affording
a
defendant the opportunity to challenge its preliminary finding.
People v. Matthews, 662 P.2d 1108 (Colo. App. 1983).</T>
   <P></P>
   <T>By failing to immediately notify the defendant of preliminary finding of competency,
and
failing to set a time within which the defendant can request a hearing to challenge its
preliminary
finding,
the trial court exceeded its jurisdiction and abused its discretion.
People v. Matthews, 662 P.2d 1108 (Colo. App. 1983);
People v. Arkadie, 692 P.2d 1145 (Colo. App. 1984).</T>
   <P></P>
   <T>
    <B>Evidence of defendant rebuts presumption of sanity.</B>
When evidence of insanity after commission of a crime is
produced by defendant, the presumption that he was
sane disappears, so that, if the people are to prevail,
they must produce evidence of sanity to rebut that of insanity
produced by the defendant. Gomez v. District Court, 179 Colo. 299,
500 P.2d 134 (1972).</T>
   <P></P>
   <T>
    <B>And it was error not to find incompetency.</B> Where no
evidence had been introduced by prosecution to dispute that
offered by petitioner that he was incompetent and incapable
of conducting his defense in a rational and reasonable manner,
trial court erred in not directing determination of incompetency.
Gomez v. District Court, 179 Colo. 299,
500 P.2d 134 (1972).</T>
   <P></P>
   <T>
    <B>Defendant's competence is an issue of fact and the trial court's findings will not
be disturbed if adequately supported by evidence in the record.</B> There was
sufficient
evidence to support the trial court's finding of competence where, although defendant
had
probably experienced a brief delusional episode during the trial, defendant had failed to
prove by a preponderance of the evidence that she suffered from a mental disease or
defect that rendered her incapable of understanding the nature and course of the
proceedings or made her incapable of participating or assisting in her defense. People v.
Corichi, 18 P.3d 807 (Colo. App. 2000).</T>
   <P></P>
   <T>
    <B>Considerable latitude is allowed by the courts in
admitting evidence</B> which has a tendency to throw light
on the mental condition of the defendant after the imposition
of sentence provided the proof tends to prove or disprove
the issue involved. Garrison v. People, 151 Colo. 388, 378
P.2d 401 (1963).</T>
   <P></P>
   <T>If evidence of a general type is otherwise competent, relevant
and material, it is not inadmissible solely because it occurred prior
to the time judgment and sentence entered in the criminal proceeding,
or because it relates to his mental condition prior to such time.
Garrison v. People, 151 Colo. 388, 378 P.2d 401 (1963).</T>
   <P></P>
   <T>Every act of the defendant's life relevant to the issue is
admissible in evidence when the defense of insanity, general or
partial, is set up. Garrison v. People, 151 Colo. 388, 378 P.2d
401 (1963).</T>
   <P></P>
   <T>
    <B>Evidence of prior mental illness relevant.</B>
In a sanity trial evidence of a prior mental illness or abnormal conduct
is relevant to the ultimate issue in the case, as such evidence renders
the claimed inference of insanity more probable than it would be without
the evidence. People v. Mack, 638 P.2d 257 (Colo. 1981).</T>
   <P></P>
   <T>
    <B>Second competency determination not required.</B>
Although placing an accused on trial while he is incompetent violates due
process of law, neither due process nor the defendant's right to effective
assistance of counsel requires the court to grant a request for a second
competency determination after the accused already has been granted an adequate
hearing on his claimed incompetency. People v. Mack, 638 P.2d 257 (Colo. 1981).</T>
   <P></P>
   <T>Defendant failed to establish a due process violation or an abuse of discretion by the
trial court in not ordering a second competency examination. People v. Stephenson, 165
P.3d 860 (Colo. App. 2007).</T>
   <P></P>
   <T>
    <B>Upon receiving an incomplete second evaluation, a court should order that</B>
(1) the evaluator render an opinion based on the available information, if possible,
despite
the defendant's noncooperation or (2) the defendant be returned to the appropriate facility
for further observation so that a competency opinion can be rendered. People v. Presson,
2013 COA 120M, 315 P.3d 198.</T>
   <P></P>
   <T>
    <B>Court erred in proceeding to determine defendant's competency to stand
trial</B> when the second competency evaluation did not contain the statutorily required
diagnosis, prognosis, and opinion, and the court declined to return defendant to the
facility to complete the evaluation. People v. Presson, 2013 COA 120M, 315 P.3d 198.</T>
   <P></P>
   <T>The error was not harmless because defendant was unfairly deprived of a second
contemporaneous evaluation, to which defendant was statutorily entitled; the court
explicitly relied on defendant's refusal to cooperate with the second evaluator in finding
defendant competent; evidence of defendant's competency was not overwhelming; and a
retrospective competency determination would not cure the error. People v. Presson,
2013
COA 120M, 315 P.3d 198.</T>
   <P></P>
   <T>
    <B>A trial court has the discretion to order a competency examination, and the
statute does not restrict this discretion to formal examinations.</B> The trial court did
not abuse its discretion by relying on a medical examination in lieu of a formal
competency examination. Bloom v. People, 185 P.3d 797 (Colo. 2008) (decided under
repealed § 16-8-111).</T>
   <P></P>
   <T>
    <B>Error to exclude cross-examination of medical witness.</B>
In a post-conviction proceeding to determine the present mental
condition of a defendant, refusal to permit cross-examination
of a medical witness, who had testified that defendant was presently
insane, as to his previous service on the commission which had
determined defendant to be a mental incompetent, is erroneous.
Garrison v. People, 151 Colo. 388, 378 P.2d 401 (1963).</T>
   <P></P>
   <T>
    <B>Judicial review.</B> Certain trial procedure safeguards
are not applicable to the process of sentencing. This principle
applies more forcefully to an effort to transplant every trial
safeguard to a determination of incompetency after conviction.
To require judicial review every time a convicted defendant
suggests incompetency would make the possibility of carrying
out a sentence depend upon fecundity in making suggestion after
suggestion of incompetency. Leick v. People, 140 Colo. 564,
345 P.2d 1054 (1959).</T>
   <P></P>
   <T>
    <B>Trial court applied the incorrect legal standards in finding defendant competent
to stand trial and, thus, abused its discretion.</B> Trial court improperly based
competency determination solely on defendant's factual understanding of proceedings
and
cognitive ability with no consideration to whether defendant's perceptions and
understandings were grounded in reality. People v. Mondragon, 217 P.3d 936 (Colo.
App. 2009).</T>
   <P></P>
   <T>
    <B>Motions to determine competency made under § 16-8.5-102 must include
threshold requirements and trial courts retain sufficient discretion to reject the rare
competency motion that rests on counsel's inadequate proffer.</B> Under the totality of
the circumstances, including the competency motion filed by defendant's counsel that
was bereft of specific facts supporting a good-faith doubt regarding defendant's
competency, the trial court did not abuse its discretion in rejecting the motion as
inadequate. People v. Lindsey, 2020 CO 21, 459 P.3d 530.</T>

  <T>(d)<M>If a defendant is in the department's custody for purposes of the competency
evaluation ordered pursuant to this article 8.5 and the defendant has completed the
competency evaluation and the evaluator has concluded that the defendant is competent
to
proceed, the department may return the defendant to a county jail or to the community, as
determined by the defendant's bond status. If the evaluator has concluded that the
defendant is incompetent to proceed and that inpatient restoration services are not
clinically appropriate, and outpatient restoration services are available to the defendant in
the community, the department shall notify the court and the court liaison, and the
department shall develop a discharge plan and a plan for community-based restoration
services in coordination with the community restoration services provider. The court
shall
hold a hearing within seven days after receiving the notice, at which the department shall
provide to the court the plan for community-based restoration services, and the court may
enter any appropriate orders regarding the custody of the defendant and his or her bond
status. The department shall advise the defendant of the date and time of the court
hearing. If the department is returning the defendant to a county jail, the county sheriff in
the jurisdiction where the defendant must return shall take custody of the defendant
within seventy-two hours after receiving notification from the department that the
defendant's evaluation is completed. At the time the department notifies the sheriff, the
department shall also notify the court and the court liaison that the department is
returning
the defendant to the custody of the jail.</M>

personnel providing ancillary services, such as testing and radiological services.
Statements
made by the defendant in the course of the evaluation shall be protected as provided in
section 16-8.5-108. If the defendant does not cooperate with the competency evaluator
and
other personnel providing ancillary services and the lack of cooperation is not the result
of
a developmental disability or a mental disability, the fact of the defendant's
noncooperation
with the competency evaluator and other personnel providing ancillary services may be
admissible in the defendant's competency or restoration hearing to rebut any evidence
introduced by the defendant with regard to the defendant's competency.</M>
  </T>
  <P N="(3)"></P>
  <T>(3)<M>To aid in forming an opinion as to the competency of the defendant, it is
permissible in the course of an evaluation under this section to use confessions and
admissions of the defendant and any other evidence of the circumstances surrounding the
commission of the offense, as well as the medical and social history of the defendant, in
questioning the defendant. When the defendant is noncooperative with the competency
evaluator or personnel providing ancillary services, an opinion of the competency of the
defendant may be rendered by the competency evaluator based upon confessions,
admissions,
and any other evidence of the circumstances surrounding the commission of the offense,
as
well as the known medical and social history of the defendant, and the opinion may be
admissible into evidence at the defendant's competency or restoration hearing.</M>

evaluator is aware that any court within the previous five years has found the defendant
is
incompetent to proceed and there is a substantial probability that with restoration services
the defendant will not attain competency within the reasonably foreseeable future, the
evaluator shall provide an opinion regarding the probability of restoration pursuant to
this
subsection (5)(e)(I) and, when the opinion is that there is a substantial probability of

why the defendant's circumstances are different from the prior court's finding;</M>

  <T>(C)<M>When the defendant is diagnosed with a moderate to severe intellectual or
developmental disability, acquired or traumatic brain injury, or dementia, which either
alone or together with a co-occurring mental illness affects the defendant's ability to gain
or maintain competency, the evaluator shall provide an opinion as to whether there is a
substantial probability that the defendant with restoration services will attain competency
within the reasonably foreseeable future. When the opinion is that there is a substantial
probability of attaining competency, the evaluator shall specifically state whether the
evaluator believes there are unique or different services outside the standard competency
restoration curriculum developed by the department that the defendant may need in order
to be restored to competency within the reasonably foreseeable future.</M>

identify those instances of findings of incompetency as a part of the review required
pursuant to subsection (5)(f) of this section. The evaluator shall provide an opinion as to
whether there is a substantial probability that the defendant with restoration services will
attain competency within the reasonably foreseeable future and maintain competency
throughout the case.</M>
  </T>
  <P N="(5)(e)(II)"></P>
  <T>(II)<M>A recommendation as to whether inpatient restoration services are clinically
appropriate to restore the defendant to competency. If inpatient restoration services are
not clinically appropriate, the department must detail the outpatient and out-of-custody
restoration services available to the defendant. For evaluation reports filed on or after
January 1, 2021, the recommendations must be based upon the restoration placement
guideline developed pursuant to section 16-8.5-121, prior to its repeal.</M>
  </T>
  <P N="(5)(f)"></P>
  <T>(f)<M>If available within the records of the department, a description of all

  <T>(h)<M>The competency evaluator's opinion as to whether the defendant meets the
criteria for certification pursuant to article 65 of title 27 or whether the defendant is
eligible for services pursuant to article 10 of title 25.5 or article 10.5 of title 27, including
the factors considered in making either determination.</M>

failure to warn or protect a specific person or persons, including those identifiable by
their association with a specific location or entity, against the violent behavior of a
defendant being evaluated by the competency evaluator, and any competency evaluator
must not be held civilly liable for failure to predict such violent behavior, except where

restoration
treatment the court shall set a hearing within thirty-five days of receiving the report on
the
issue of whether there is a substantial probability that the defendant will be restored to
competency within the reasonably foreseeable future and, in the case of a finding
pursuant
to section 16-8.5-105 (5)(e)(I)(D), maintain competency through the adjudication of the
case. At the hearing, there is a presumption that the defendant will not attain competency
within the reasonably foreseeable future. A party attempting to overcome that
presumption must prove by a preponderance of the evidence that there is a substantial
probability that restoration efforts will be successful within the reasonably foreseeable
future. At the conclusion of the hearing when there is an opinion pursuant to section
16-8.5-105 (5)(e)(I)(D), if the court finds that there is not a substantial probability that

foreseeable future, then the court shall order restoration education for an initial period of
time not to exceed ninety-one days as provided for in this section and review of the case

future
and maintain competency through the adjudication of the case, and the court shall

recognizance bond and the defendant is committed for inpatient restoration, the court
must make findings of fact that extraordinary circumstances exist to overcome the
presumption of a release and the clinical recommendation for outpatient treatment by

sheriff of the jurisdiction where the defendant is to be returned and the court liaison.
Within seventy-two hours after receipt of the notice, the sheriff shall return the defendant
to the jail. When a defendant is transferred to the physical custody of the sheriff, the
department shall work with the sheriff and any behavioral health providers in the jail to
ensure that the jail has the necessary information to prevent any decompensation by the
defendant while the defendant is in jail, which must include medication information

    <B>Annotator's note.</B> Since § 16-8.5-111 is similar to repealed §
16-8-112, relevant cases construing that provision have been included in the annotations
to
this section.</T>
   <P></P>
   <T>
    <B>Purpose of section.</B> This section considers the interests
of both society and the individual accused and strikes a fair balance.
A person who is found to be incompetent is treated and confined only
to the extent necessary for the protection of society. Parks
v. Denver District Court, 180 Colo. 202,
503 P.2d 1029 (1972).</T>
   <P></P>
   <T>
    <B>Commitment does not deny defendant due process.</B> The fact that
the defendant may be committed to an institution for an indefinite period
of time, before trial and pending the regaining of competency, affords and
does not deny the defendant due process. Schwader v. District Court,
172 Colo. 474, 474 P.2d 607 (1970).</T>
   <P></P>
   <T>
    <B>A finding of incompetence to stand trial only results in an
abatement of the criminal proceedings.</B>
Parks v. Denver District Court, 180 Colo. 202, 503 P.2d 1029 (1972).</T>
   <P></P>
   <T>
    <B>Court retains jurisdiction during confinement.</B> During confinement
the court which commits the accused retains jurisdiction to oversee his
commitment and to protect his constitutional rights and should do so.
Parks v. Denver District Court, 180 Colo. 202,
503 P.2d 1029 (1972).</T>
   <P></P>
   <T>
    <B>And it is the trial judge's duty to make periodic checks
to determine the status and condition of an incompetent</B> who has
criminal charges pending against him under any valid statute
and who has been committed after a finding of incompetence to
stand trial. Parks v. Denver District Court, 180 Colo. 202,
503 P.2d 1029 (1972).</T>
   <P></P>
   <T>
    <B>During commitment, there can be no final judgment
subject to appeal.</B> Where defendant was committed following
a determination that he became incompetent subsequent to alleged
offense, and the issue raised by a plea of not guilty remains
unresolved until defendant is determined to be able to stand trial,
there can be no final judgment from which an appeal can be taken,
as the litigation has not yet been terminated on its merits. Rupert v.
People, 156 Colo. 277, 398 P.2d 434 (1965).</T>
   <P></P>
   <T>
    <B>Section does not preclude the release on bail of a person who is
determined to be incompetent and charged with a violent crime.</B> People v.
White, 819 P.2d 1096 (Colo. App. 1991).</T>
   <P></P>
   <T>
    <B>The court of appeals can order a limited remand to the district court for
restoration proceedings pursuant to this section</B> for future determination of motions
to dismiss counsel and dismiss the appeal. People v. Liggett, 2018 COA 94M, -- P.3d
--.</T>

  </CATCH-LINE>
(1)<M>If a defendant committed to the custody of the department for evaluation or for
restoration treatment meets the constitutional requirements for the administration of
involuntary medication, the defendant's treating physician may petition the court for an order
requiring that the defendant accept the treatment or, alternatively, that the medication be
forcibly administered to the defendant. The department shall, prior to the hearing on the
petition, deliver a copy of the petition to the court that committed the defendant to the
custody of the department, the prosecuting attorney, and the defendant's legal representation
in the criminal case, if such representation exists, and to the defendant directly if he or she
does not have legal representation. A physician shall assess and document the defendant's
mental status prior to the administration of medication.</M>
  <P N="(2)"></P>
  <T>(2)<M>A petition for involuntary treatment shall be heard in the court of the jurisdiction
where the defendant is located. The department shall promptly deliver a copy of the order
granting or denying the petition to the court that committed the defendant to the custody of
the department, the prosecuting attorney, and the defendant's legal representation in the
criminal case, if such representation exists, and to the defendant directly if he or she does not
have legal representation.</M>
  </T>
  <P N="(3)"></P>
  <T>(3)<M>If the committing court elects to transfer venue for medication hearings to the
court of the jurisdiction in which the defendant is located, the committing county shall
reimburse the county in which the proceeding is heard for the reasonable costs incurred in
conducting the proceeding. Alternatively, the district attorney for the committing county, or
in any county or any city and county having a population exceeding fifty thousand persons
the county attorney for the committing county, may prosecute the proceeding as the
proponent of the physician's petition.</M>
  </T>
  <P N="(4)"></P>
  <T>(4)<M>If a defendant committed to the custody of the department for evaluation or for
restoration treatment is ordered by a court to accept treatment as set forth in subsection (1)
of this section and is subsequently returned to jail for pending court proceedings, the county
jail may require the defendant to continue to receive the same court-ordered treatment that
was administered by the department before the defendant was discharged from inpatient care,
or, alternatively, appropriate medical personnel provided by the jail may forcibly administer
such court-ordered medication to the defendant.</M>

included in the

   <P></P>
   <T>
    <B>This section as amended in 1989 gives the district attorney the authority
to initiate the termination of criminal proceedings against an incompetent
defendant.</B> The statute does not, however, give the district attorney the
power to dictate whether the defendant will be released or civilly committed
once the trial court determines that there is not a substantial probability
that the defendant will be restored to competency in the foreseeable future.
People v. Zapotocky, 869 P.2d 1234 (Colo. 1994).</T>
   <P></P>
   <T>
    <B>Trial court incorrectly declared this statute to be an unconstitutional
violation of due process</B> where it erroneously believed that the defendant
has
a right to dismissal of criminal charges if it does not appear reasonably
likely that he will be competent to stand trial in the future. People v.
Zapotocky, 869 P.2d 1234 (Colo. 1994).</T>
   <P></P>
   <T>
    <B>The decision to request dismissal of pending criminal charges is within
the district attorney's discretion</B> and the decision may not be controlled
or limited by judicial intervention. Therefore, transferring the decision to
dismiss pending criminal proceedings against incompetent defendants from the
trial court to the district attorney is consistent with the traditional
powers
of the trial court and the prosecutor. People v. Zapotocky, 869 P.2d
1234 (Colo. 1994).</T>
   <P></P>
   <T>
    <B>Since under the pre-1989 and post-1989 versions of subsection (2), a court
cannot terminate criminal proceedings against an incompetent defendant until a
finding of indefinite incompetency is made,</B> and the trial court did not
make such a finding until after the statute was amended, application of the
amended statute did not violate the ex post facto clauses of the United
States constitution or Colorado constitution. People v. Zapotocky, 869 P.2d

    <B>Method for compelling attendance of out-of-state witnesses.</B>
This uniform act provides a method whereby, among states
that have adopted the act, a court of one state may certify the
need for the appearance and testimony of a material witness
residing in another state and thereby invoke the authority
of the court in the resident state to compel the witness's
attendance in the certifying court. Hence, at least under
the circumstances specified in the statute, a Colorado court
may now compel the attendance of out-of-state witnesses.
People v. McCabe, 37 Colo. App. 181, 546 P.2d 1289 (1975).</T>
   <P></P>
   <T>
    <B>Payment for witnesses is the obligation of the state.</B> In
concluding that the courts lack the ability to compel the
attendance of out-of-state witnesses for an indigent
defendant, a court's reliance upon the silence of the uniform
act as to the source of any money to be paid to the witness
was misplaced in Colorado. The failure of the uniform act
to address this issue does not support this conclusion since
the statutes and rules of criminal procedure both create the
obligation and provide for payment.
People v. McCabe, 37 Colo. App. 181, 546 P.2d 1289 (1975).</T>
   <P></P>
   <T>
    <B>The provisions of this part 2 do not extend to authorizing a court to subpoena a
witness who is residing outside the United States.</B> The district court erred in
granting a motion under the provisions of rule 15 of the Colorado rules of criminal
procedure to depose a witness residing in Mexico. The rule requires that the deposition
be conducted in the presence of the court and requires the court to subpoena the witness.
The court does not have jurisdiction to subpoena a witness who resides in another
country
because the provisions of this part 2 extend only to other states that have adopted a

The right of a person who is accused of an offense other than a
noncriminal traffic infraction or offense, or other than a municipal charter, municipal
ordinance, or county ordinance violation as provided in section 16-10-109 (1), to have a trial
by jury is inviolate and a matter of substantive due process of law as distinguished from one
of "practice and procedure". The people shall also have the right to refuse to consent to a
waiver of a trial or sentencing determination by jury in all cases in which the accused has the
right to request a trial or sentencing determination by jury.</SECTION-TEXT>

    <B>Fundamental right to trial by jury in criminal cases is paramount
constitutional
right</B> guaranteed by the sixth amendment to the United States constitution and
§ 23 of art. II,
Colo. Const. People v. Evans, 44 Colo. App. 288, 612 P.2d 1153 (1980).</T>
   <P></P>
   <T>
    <B>A person does not have a right to a jury trial</B> upon being found in
contempt of court if the person is not subject to more than six months
incarceration upon issuance of such citation. People v. Barron, 677 P.2d 1370
(Colo. 1984); Kourlis v. Port, 18 P.3d 770 (Colo. App. 2000).</T>
   <P></P>
   <T>
    <B>This section extends a statutory right to a jury trial only to violations of state
statutes</B> not contempt charges. People v. Shell, 148 P.3d 162 (Colo. 2006).</T>
   <P></P>
   <T>
    <B>Death qualified juries are not more prone to convict than to acquit</B>
and do not deny a defendant his right to an impartial jury. People v. Manier,
184 Colo. 44,
518 P.2d 811 (1974).</T>
   <P></P>
   <T>
    <B>Defendant may waive his right to jury trial;</B> however, that waiver must
be understandingly, voluntarily, and deliberately made, and a determination
of waiver must be a matter of certainty and not implication. People v.
Evans, 44 Colo. App. 288, 612 P.2d 1153 (1980).</T>
   <P></P>
   <T>
    <B>But defendant must personally express waiver.</B>
Where, the prosecution conceded that prior to the time defendant requested
a jury trial he had not personally expressed a waiver of his right to trial
by a jury, trial court, which,
in reviewing the question of whether to grant a jury trial, questioned defendant
concerning his understanding relative to counsel's waiver of his rights
the previous day and which concluded that because defendant had concurred
in counsel's request the waiver was valid, did not comport with the requirement
of Crim. P. 23(a)(5) because the waiver must be expressed
by defendant personally at the time that the waiver is attempted. People
v. Evans, 44 Colo. App. 288, 612 P.2d 1153 (1980).</T>
   <P></P>
   <T>
    <B>Under unitary trial provision, defendant does not possess a statutory right to a
jury trial on the merits and the affirmative defense of insanity</B> if a plea of not guilty
by reason of insanity was entered and stipulated to by the prosecution. People v. Laeke,
2012 CO 13M, 271 P.3d 1111, cert. denied, 568 U.S. 829, 133 S. Ct. 109, 184 L. Ed. 2d

   <P></P>
   <T>
    <B>Valid waiver of jury trial does not require extensive, on-the-record
advisements</B> of the kind set out in United States v. Robertson, 45 F. 3d 1423 (10th
Cir.
1995). People v. Thompson, 121 P.3d 273 (Colo. App. 2005).</T>
   <P></P>
   <T>
    <B>Defendant voluntarily waived jury.</B> Where, when the jury was assembled
in the courtroom ready for trial, defendants' counsel orally announced
that defendants had decided to waive their right to a jury trial,
and the court inquired of each defendant if that was his desire and both
indicated in the affirmative, and, as a further precaution, the court
then insisted that a written waiver of jury trial be prepared and be signed
by each defendant and counsel, which was done, it will be presumed
that defendants understandingly, voluntarily, and deliberately decided
to waive the jury. People v. Fowler, 183 Colo. 300, 516 P.2d 428 (1973).</T>
   <P></P>
   <T>Where the record of the trial court discloses that the trial judge
orally advised the defendant of his right to a jury, that the defendant read
and signed a written waiver, and that he failed to give any indication
to the trial court that his waiver was not voluntary, the record was substantial evidence
to support the findings that the waiver was voluntary. People v. Simms, 185 Colo. 214,
523 P.2d 463 (1974).</T>
   <P></P>
   <T>
    <B>Waiver precludes defendant's complaint that judge rules on evidence
and renders verdict.</B> Where the defendant voluntarily and with advice
of counsel waived a jury trial, defendant in such circumstances cannot be
heard to complain when he creates a situation which necessarily makes
the trial judge both the one who decides the admissibility of evidence
and the one who renders the verdict. People v. Thompson, 182 Colo. 198,
511 P.2d 909 (1973).</T>
   <P></P>
   <T>
    <B>Colorado constitution does not afford criminal defendants the right to
waive jury</B> and be tried by the court. People v. District Court, 843 P.2d 6
(Colo. 1992);
People v. District Court, 953 P.2d 184 (Colo. 1998).</T>
   <P></P>
   <T>
    <B>A court exceeds its jurisdiction if it allows a defendant to waive his or her right
to a jury trial over the objection of the district attorney</B> based on defendant's claim
that his due process rights would be violated by testifying and that he would be subject to
impeachment about his past criminal convictions and his ties to drug use. It is not a due
process violation to be subject to impeachment about prior criminal convictions; the
choice to testify or not is part of adversarial trial process and does not create an unfair
trial for the defendant. People v. McKeel, 246 P.3d 638 (Colo. 2010).</T>
   <P></P>
   <T>
    <B>In construing the provisions of this section with § 18-1-406 (2),
granting the defendant the right to waive a jury trial,</B> due process compels
conclusion that prosecution alone cannot compel
trial by jury
where defendant may not receive a fair trial. People v. District Court, 843
P.2d 6 (Colo. 1992).</T>
   <P></P>
   <T>
    <B>Provisions of this section which require the people's consent as a
prerequisite to defendant's waiver of trial by jury held facially
constitutional;</B> however as applied may violate an accused's right to due
process. People v. District Court, 843 P.2d 6 (Colo. 1992).</T>
   <P></P>
   <T>
    <B>Unqualified prosecution consent requirement to defendant's waiver of
trial
by jury may violate defendant's constitutional right to due process</B> where
defendant contends that such trial would constitute an unfair proceeding
before a biased jury. People v. District Court, 843 P.2d 6 (Colo. 1992).</T>
   <P></P>
   <T>
    <B>It is incumbent upon a criminal defendant, in seeking waiver of jury
trial, to raise due process concerns with the trial court;</B> trial court may
evaluate whether a defendant's due process rights are
violated only after the defendant makes a showing that an inability to waive
trial by jury infringes on defendant's due process rights. People v.
District Court, 843 P.2d 6 (Colo. 1992).</T>
   <P></P>
   <T>
    <B>In determining whether defendant's right to a fair trial would be violated
by denying defendant's waiver of jury trial, trial court may consider</B> the
extent to which a change in venue may cure bias or prejudice against the
defendant. People v. District Court, 843 P.2d 6 (Colo. 1992).</T>
   <P></P>
   <T>
    <B>Due process does not require the prosecution to consent to a waiver of a jury
trial</B> in a trial for possession of a weapon by a prior offender merely because the jury
will hear evidence of a prior offense even if one of the prior offenses was for a similar
weapons offense. People v. District Court, 953 P.2d 184 (Colo. 1998).</T>

In all criminal cases where the
panel of jurors is exhausted by challenge or otherwise, and whether any
juror has been selected and sworn or not, the court may order the issuance
of a venire for
any number of jurors not exceeding twenty-four, returnable forthwith, out of which
persons so ordered to be summoned it is lawful to impanel a jury for the trial of
any criminal case. Should the jurors thus summoned be insufficient, by reason of
challenges or otherwise, to form an impartial jury, the court may make further
orders for
additional jurors, returnable forthwith, until a full jury is obtained.</SECTION-TEXT>

    <B>Right to impartial jury.</B>
It is fundamental to the right to a fair trial that a defendant be provided
with an impartial jury. Nailor v. People, 200 Colo. 30, 612 P.2d 79 (1980).</T>
   <P></P>

   <P></P>
   <T>
    <B>A defendant has a fundamental right to a fair trial by a panel of
impartial
jurors,</B> and, to protect that right, the trial court must exclude prejudiced
or biased persons from the jury. People v. Ferrero, 874 P.2d 468
(Colo. App. 1993).</T>
   <P></P>
   <T>
    <B>However, the trial court may consider a potential juror's assurances that
the juror can fairly and impartially serve on the case</B> in determining
whether
that juror will be able to set aside a preconceived notion and render an
impartial verdict according to the law and the evidence admitted at trial.

   <T>
    <B>Neither the prosecution nor the defendant is granted any right in this
jurisdiction, by constitution, statute, or rule, to shape the composition of the jury through
the use of peremptory challenges.</B> The defendant could not have been harmed by the
deprivation of any such right. Vigil v. People, 2019 CO 105, 455 P.3d 332.</T>
   <P></P>
   <T>Trial court did not abuse its discretion in denying challenge for cause. It was the trial
court's role to assess and decide whether the juror could assess the victim's testimony like
any other witness's testimony even though the juror had a prior relationship with the
victim's family. Vigil v. People, 2019 CO 105, 455 P.3d 332.</T>
   <P></P>
   <T>
    <B>A trial court should do one of three things if a prospective juror indicates an
unwillingness to apply the law:</B> (1) Dismiss the juror for cause; (2) conduct
rehabilitative questioning following up on the juror's concerning statements before
denying the challenge for cause; or (3) make findings on the record explaining why the
juror's statements indicating an unwillingness or inability to follow the law should be
disregarded in light of other seemingly inconsistent statements. People v. Marciano, 2014
COA 92M, 411 P.3d 831.</T>
   <P></P>
   <T>
    <B>Standard of review is "abuse of discretion".</B> Phrases used in prior case law
such as "clear abuse of discretion" and "gross abuse of discretion" are deemed to express
this
standard and have the same meaning. Carrillo v. People, 974 P.2d 478 (Colo. 1999);
People v. Vecchiarelli-McLaughlin, 984 P.2d 72 (Colo. 1999);
People v. Martinez, 18 P.3d 831 (Colo. App. 2000); People v. Dashner, 77 P.3d 787
(Colo. App. 2003).</T>
   <P></P>
   <T>The trial court did not abuse its discretion for denying a challenge for cause when
there was reasonable evidence that the juror would be impartial. Therefore, the appellate
court erred when it overturned a conviction on the basis that the juror thought that being
charged was evidence of guilt because subsequent questioning demonstrated to the trial
court that the juror would base his decision on "the facts". People v. Young, 16 P.3d 821
(Colo. 2001).</T>
   <P></P>
   <T>The trial court did not abuse its discretion in denying a challenge for cause where, in
a case involving a homosexual defendant charged with sexual assault, the prospective
juror initially stated she had a religious objection to homosexuality. It was within the
court's discretion to rely on the prospective juror's later statements that, based on the
evidence presented, she would decide whether the defendant committed an illegal act
rather than judge him on his sexual preference. People v. Hoskay, 87 P.3d 194 (Colo.
App. 2003); People v. Simon, 100 P.3d 487 (Colo. App. 2004).</T>
   <P></P>
   <T>
    <B>It is within the trial court's prerogative to give considerable weight to a potential
juror's statement</B> that he or she can fairly and impartially serve on the case. People
v. Montoya, 942 P.2d 1287 (Colo. App. 1996);
People v. Young, 16 P.3d 821 (Colo. 2001).</T>
   <P></P>
   <T>
    <B>When the trial court grants the prosecution's for-cause challenge of a
prospective juror, reversal is not required when the claim is that the court abused its
discretion.</B> Because the prospective juror did not sit in judgment of the case, that
ruling could not have deprived the defendant of his constitutional right to a fair and
impartial jury; and because neither the prosecution nor the defendant is granted any right
in this jurisdiction, by constitution, statute, or rule, to shape the composition of the jury
through the use of peremptory challenges, the defendant could not have been harmed by
the deprivation of any such right. Vigil v. People, 2019 CO 105, 455 P.3d 332.</T>
   <P></P>
   <T>
    <B>Absence of qualification is basis for challenge, not absolute prohibition.</B>
The failure of a prospective juror to meet a qualification for jury service
operates as a basis of a challenge for cause, rather than as an absolute
prohibition to service; accordingly, that challenge is waived if counsel
does not use reasonable diligence on voir dire to determine if a challenge
for cause exists. People v. Crespin, 635 P.2d 918 (Colo. App. 1981).</T>
   <P></P>
   <T>Failure of prospective juror to meet a qualification for jury service operates as a basis
of a challenge for cause rather than as an absolute prohibition to service. People v.
Orozco,
49 P.3d 1212 (Colo. App. 2002).</T>
   <P></P>
   <T>
    <B>Reversal of a criminal conviction for other than structural error is not required
absent an express legislative mandate or</B> an appropriate case-specific
outcome-determinative analysis. Allowing a defendant fewer peremptory challenges than
authorized or than exercised by the prosecution is not structural error requiring reversal.

    <B>Trial court did not abuse its discretion</B> in denying challenge of
potential juror for cause. Juror admitted that she had read about the case

might not be entirely truthful or accurate, and the juror stated that he had not formed an
opinion about defendant's guilt or innocence. People v. Medina, 72 P.3d 405 (Colo.

   <P></P>
   <T>Trial court did not abuse its discretion in denying defendant's challenge for cause
where defense counsel asked during voir dire whether anyone believed it would be
impossible to be fair if defendant did not testify and juror stated that it would and that it
might upset her, but not so much as to affect her decision-making. The trial court found
that the juror indicated she would do what the court instructed her to do even though she
might not like it. People v. Frantz, 114 P.3d 34 (Colo. App. 2004).</T>
   <P></P>
   <T>The court did not abuse its discretion in denying defendant's challenge for cause.

   <P></P>
   <T>Under the totality of the circumstances, trial court's denial of challenge for cause was

through questioning. Marko v. People, 2018 CO 97, 432 P.3d 607.</T>
   <P></P>
   <T>
    <B>Similarly, trial court did not abuse its discretion</B> in
excusing a potential juror for cause when the potential juror
expressed a particular aversion to serving as a juror in a sexual

People v. Schmidt, 885 P.2d 312 (Colo. App. 1994).</T>
   <P></P>
   <T>
    <B>Trial court did not abuse its discretion in granting challenge for cause</B> when
the potential juror expressed an opinion that he thought the law was unfair because court
reasoned that based on juror's opinion of the law, there was a question as to whether the

   <P></P>
   <T>
    <B>No abuse of discretion for denying challenge for cause.</B> Although the

fair to the defendant. People v. Garrison, 2012 COA 132M, 303 P.3d 117.</T>
   <P></P>
   <T>
    <B>Court did not err in not dismissing for cause two jurors</B> who specifically

   <P></P>
   <T>
    <B>It is incumbent upon challenging party to clearly state on the record the

   <P></P>
   <T>Trial court did not abuse its discretion in disallowing one of defense

   <T>
    <B>Grant of challenge for cause within discretion of trial court.</B>
The ultimate decision of whether or not to grant a challenge for cause is
one for the trial court's sound discretion, since the factors of credibility

The need for a careful evaluation of the competence of potential jurors

jury selection procedures. Morgan v. People, 624 P.2d 1331 (Colo. 1981).</T>
   <P></P>

   <P></P>
   <T>Trial courts have considerable discretion in ruling on challenges for cause, because

    <B>This section controls over court rule.</B>
Peremptory challenges, while not constitutionally required, are deemed to be an
effective means of securing a more impartial and better qualified jury and, as
such, are an important right of an
accused. While also having an incidental effect on trial procedure, this
section is primarily an expression of policy concerning this right of the
accused, a substantive matter, and, thus, controls
over Crim. P. 24(d). People v. Hollis, 670 P.2d 441 (Colo. App. 1983).</T>
   <P></P>
   <T>
    <B>Although the statute refers to the number of challenges in capital cases, it does
not define "capital case".</B> By contrast, Crim. P. 24(d)(1) does define the term. The
rule and the statute, therefore, do not "conflict" in the sense of being irreconcilable or
necessarily incompatible with each other, and the rule can be given effect without
producing a result irreconcilable with the plain language of the statute. People v.
Reynolds,
159 P.3d 684 (Colo. App. 2006).</T>
   <P></P>
   <T>
    <B>There is no conflict between the number of peremptory challenges provided by
this section and Crim. P. 24(d)(4) regarding nonreduction of peremptory challenges
where there has been a waiver.</B> Where counsel waives a peremptory challenge,
counsel does not lose that challenge and can still take advantage of all available
peremptory challenges to which the party is entitled, so long as, after waiver, at least one
new juror is called into the jury box. People v. Terhorst, 2015 COA 110, 360 P.3d 239.</T>
   <P></P>
   <T>
    <B>Denial of right to use all challenges is reversible error.</B>
The denial of the right of a party to use all of his peremptory challenges
creates a jury
which is not a statutory tribunal and therefore constitutes reversible error.
People v. Haines, 37 Colo. App. 302, 549 P.2d 786 (1976).</T>
   <P></P>
   <T>
    <B>Although right to peremptory challenges is not constitutional,</B> failure to
allow defendant peremptory challenges as provided in this section violates defendant's
due process rights. People v. Vieyra, 169 P.3d 205 (Colo. App. 2007).</T>
   <P></P>
   <T>
    <B>Trial court need not remind defendant of remaining peremptory challenges</B>
because it is counsel's duty, and not a responsibility of the court, to track such challenges.
People v. Vieyra, 169 P.3d 205 (Colo. App. 2007).</T>
   <P></P>
   <T>
    <B>Defendant failed to prove beyond a reasonable doubt that statute is
unconstitutional as applied to defendants jointly tried,</B> as peremptory
challenges are not constitutionally required and statute is rationally related
to a legitimate state interest. People v. Gardenhire, 903 P.2d 1159 (Colo.
App. 1995).</T>
   <P></P>
   <T>
    <B>Statute does not unconstitutionally discriminate against a person facing life
imprisonment as a result of a habitual criminal conviction.</B> Because class 1 felonies
are the most serious offenses, the general assembly could rationally perceive that
additional procedural protections are warranted. People v. Turley, 18 P.3d 802

    <B>Time for determining the number of peremptory challenges</B> is the time voir

rule in effect at the time voir dire is conducted.

   <P></P>
   <T>
    <B>Reversal of a criminal conviction for other than structural error is not required
absent an express legislative mandate or</B> an appropriate case-specific
outcome-determinative analysis. Allowing a defendant fewer peremptory challenges than
authorized or than exercised by the prosecution is not structural error requiring reversal.

   <T>
    <B>Trial court's failure to excuse juror for cause was harmless.</B> Defendant used
a peremptory challenge to correct the court's failure to remove the juror. But the record
did not reflect that a biased or incompetent juror served on the jury, and therefore
defendant could not establish he was harmed by the trial court's erroneous failure to
excuse the juror for cause. People v. Oliver, 2020 COA 97, 474 P.3d 207.</T>
   <P></P>
   <T>
    <B>Prejudicial error</B> occurred when a defendant was required to exercise a
peremptory challenge under this section to remove a suspect juror following
trial court's improper denial of defendant's challenge for cause where
defendant exhausted all available peremptory challenges on the other jurors.

   <T>
    <B>Prejudice is shown if defendant exhausts all of his peremptory challenges

   <P></P>
   <T>
    <B>No error occurred when trial court properly denied defendant's motion for cause
challenge to a juror who would base her decision on the evidence presented at trial and
who would follow the court's instructions concerning the presumption of innocence;</B>
defendant cannot claim prejudice for his choice not to excuse the juror by use of a
peremptory challenge. Morrison v. People, 19 P.3d 668 (Colo. 2000); People v.
Honeysette,
53 P.3d 714 (Colo. App. 2002).</T>
   <P></P>
   <T>
    <B>Where the trial court improperly removed jurors for cause and the prosecution
subsequently used all of its peremptory challenges, the prosecution enjoyed an unfair
tactical advantage in determining the makeup of the jury, detrimentally affecting the
rights of the defendant and requiring a new trial.</B> Improperly dismissing some
jurors
for cause has the effect of granting additional peremptory challenges to the prosecution.
It is irrelevant that the defendant has full ability to use his peremptory challenges. The
prosecution's relatively greater ability to remove jurors it views as objectionable is
independently prejudicial to the defendant's rights, and the court will presume prejudice
to the defendant. People v. Lefebre, 5 P.3d 295 (Colo. 2000), overruled in People v.
Novotny, 2014 CO 18, 320 P.3d 1194.</T>

The court may direct that a sufficient number of jurors in
addition to the regular jury be called and impaneled to sit as alternate jurors. Alternate
jurors in the order in which they are called shall replace jurors who, prior to the time the
jury retires to consider its verdict, become unable or disqualified to perform their duties.
Alternate jurors shall be drawn in the same manner, shall have the same qualifications,
shall be subject to the same examination and challenges, shall take the same oath, and
shall have the same functions, powers, facilities, and privileges as the regular jurors. An
alternate juror shall be discharged when the jury retires to consider its verdict or at such
time as determined by the court. When alternate jurors are impaneled, each side is
entitled to one peremptory challenge in addition to those otherwise allowed by law. In a
case in which a class 1, 2, or 3 felony, as described in section 18-1.3-401 (1)(a)(IV) and
(1)(a)(V), C.R.S., is charged, and in a case in which a level 1 or level 2 drug felony as
described in section 18-1.3-401.5, C.R.S., is charged, and in any case in which a felony
listed in section 24-4.1-302 (1), C.R.S., is charged, the court shall impanel at least one

liability and in which the state constitution has provided a criminal defendant the right to
a
unanimous jury verdict. People v. Hall, 60 P.3d 728 (Colo. App. 2002).</T>
   <P></P>
   <T>
    <B>The use of a sealed verdict in prosecution for aggravated robbery
was not improper.</B> People v. Herrera, 182 Colo. 302, 512 P.2d 1160 (1973).</T>
   <P></P>
   <T>
    <B>Retrial of defendant on kidnapping charge, after the first trial was declared a
mistrial without objection from either party, did not violate statute requiring the verdict
of
the jury to be unanimous</B> or the defendant's right to due process because the federal
constitution does not guarantee a defendant a unanimous verdict of either guilty or not
guilty. People v. Barton, 58 P.3d 1075 (Colo. App. 2002).</T>
   <P></P>
   <T>
    <B>Unanimity is required only with respect to ultimate issue of defendant's
guilt</B> or innocence of the crime charged and not with respect to alternative
means by which the crime was committed. People v. Taggart, 621 P.2d 1375 (Colo.
1981);
People v. Vigil, 678 P.2d 554 (Colo. App. 1983); People v. Marquez, 692 P.2d 1089
(Colo.
1984); People v. Davis, 2017 COA 40M, 415 P.3d 838.</T>
   <P></P>
   <T>If the court has not required the prosecution to elect the transaction on which it relies
for conviction, to ensure jury unanimity, the jury must be instructed that to convict the
defendant it must unanimously agree that the defendant committed the same act or
committed all the acts within the period charged. People v. Rivera, 56 P.3d 1155 (Colo.
App. 2002); People v. Gookins, 111 P.3d 525 (Colo. App. 2004).</T>
   <P></P>
   <T>Failure of trial court to give unanimity instruction constitutes plain error if that
failure results in confusion whether jurors' conviction was based upon a true unanimity
or whether different incidents formed the basis for the conclusion of individual jurors. In
cases involving multiple acts, unanimity instruction assures that the jury does not base its
conviction upon some jurors finding that one act was committed while others rely on a
different act. People v. Devine, 74 P.3d 440 (Colo. App. 2003).</T>
   <P></P>
   <T>
    <B>When evidence of several acts is presented at trial, any one of which could form
the basis of the offense, the court must either:</B> (1) Require the prosecution to elect
the act that it's relying upon for the conviction, or (2) instruct the jury that they must
unanimously agree on a specific act defendant committed that serves as the basis for the
conviction. Quintano v. People, 105 P.3d 585 (Colo. 2005); People v. Childress, 2012
COA 116, 409 P.3d 365, rev'd on other grounds, 2015 CO 65M, 363 P.3d 155.</T>
   <P></P>
   <T>The prosecution presented several acts that could have constituted child abuse, so an
election or a modified unanimity instruction was required. People v. Childress, 2012
COA
116, 409 P.3d 365, rev'd on other grounds, 2015 CO 65M, 363 P.3d 155.</T>
   <P></P>
   <T>The defendant did not waive her unanimity argument but forfeited it. It was not plain
error by the trial court for not requiring an election or giving a modified unanimity
instruction. People v. Wester-Gravelle, 2020 CO 64, 465 P.3d 570.</T>
   <P></P>
   <T>
    <B>Consideration of lesser charge permitted without acquittal of greater
charge.</B> Acquittal of a greater charge by a unanimous vote of the jury
is not necessary before the jury can consider a lesser included offense.
People v. McGregor, 635 P.2d 912 (Colo. App. 1981).</T>
   <P></P>
   <T>
    <B>The jury instruction for felony menacing which did not specify a particular
victim,</B> coupled with the comments of the prosecutor, invited the jury to convict
without
regard to the identity of the victim, making it impossible to determine whether the jury
unanimously convicted defendant on the basis of menacing the same victim. People v.
Simmons, 973 P.2d 627 (Colo. App. 1998).</T>
   <P></P>
   <T>
    <B>The court did not commit plain error when it failed to instruct the jury that it
must unanimously agree on the underlying felony for the first degree burglary
conviction.</B> Because the jury unanimously found defendant guilty of attempted
aggravated robbery, the finding satisfied the intent requirement of first degree burglary as
well as any requirement that the jury agree unanimously to the underlying offense.
Therefore, the court's failure to give a unanimity instruction was not plain error because
there was no reasonable possibility that any error contributed to defendant's conviction.
People v. Linares-Guzman, 195 P.3d 1130 (Colo. App. 2008).</T>
   <P></P>
   <T>
    <B>Jurors must unanimously agree on how the prosecution disproved affirmative
defense of self-defense.</B> The trial court abused its discretion in permitting the
prosecution to prove felony menacing without instructing the jury that it must
unanimously agree on which exception to self-defense it relied. People v. Mosely, 2019
COA 143, -- P.3d --.</T>
   <P></P>
   <T>
    <B>Jurors do not need to unanimously agree on a particular exception to
self-defense.</B> People v. Roberts-Bicking, 2021 COA 12, -- P.3d --.</T>
   <P></P>
   <T>
    <B>It was not plain error for the unanimity instruction to refer only to sexual assault
when the jury was also instructed on the lesser included offense of unlawful sexual
contact.</B> The better practice would be to have the instruction refer to both, but based
on the rest of the instructions and the closing arguments, the jury could infer that
unanimity applied to both offenses. People v. Abdulla, 2020 COA 109M, -- P.3d --.</T>

offense or any other municipal charter, municipal ordinance, or county ordinance offense
which is neither criminal nor punishable by imprisonment under any counterpart state
statute
shall not constitute a petty offense. No child under the age of eighteen years shall be
entitled

trial, in writing, and tenders to the court a jury fee of twenty-five dollars unless the fee is
waived by the judge because of the indigence of the defendant. The jury shall consist of three
jurors unless a greater number, not to exceed six, is requested by the defendant in said jury
demand. If the charge is dismissed or the defendant is acquitted of the charge or if the

   <T>Where defendant was a juvenile charged with theft under the Longmont

    <B>A first-time charge of driving while ability impaired is not a petty offense.</B>
The general assembly's placement of numerous alcohol and drug-related offenses in a
single
statute demonstrates an intention not to treat first-time driving while ability impaired
offenses as petty offenses. The penalties are dependent upon circumstances that may not
be
known by the court at the time of arraignment. The penalties for a first-time offense may
easily exceed those of a petty offense under this section. Therefore, defendants are not

Evidence that a witness made a prior inconsistent statement is admissible
if the statement is inconsistent, the witness is given an opportunity to
explain or deny the statement or is available for recall, the statement
purports to relate to a matter within the witness's personal knowledge, and
the evidence offered to prove that the prior inconsistent statement was

confrontation right.

    <B>Inability to remember statement deemed denial thereof.</B>

there appears to be any variance
between the statements in the indictment, complaint, or information and
the evidence offered in proof thereof, of any given
name or surname, or both given name and surname, or

or in the name or description of any matter or thing whatsoever therein
named or described, such variance is not grounds for the acquittal of the
defendant, unless the court before which such trial be had finds such
variance is material to the merits of the case or may be prejudicial to the
defendant. No indictment, information, felony complaint, or complaint shall
be deemed insufficient nor shall the trial, judgment,

the people's evidence clearly established that the check was not duly signed by an
officer of the corporation, but was in fact a forgery, which offense defendant was not

  </CATCH-LINE>
(1)<M>The general assembly hereby finds and declares
that sexual offenses are a matter of grave statewide concern.
These frequently occurring offenses are aggressive and assaultive
violations of the well-being, privacy, and security of the
victims, are severely contrary to common notions of proper
behavior between people, and result in serious and long-lasting
harm to individuals and society. These offenses often are not
reported or are reported long after the offense for many reasons,
including: The frequency with which the victims are vulnerable,
such as young children who may be related to the perpetrator; the
personal indignity, humiliation, and embarrassment involved in the
offenses themselves; and the fear of further personal indignity,
humiliation, and embarrassment in connection with investigation
and prosecution. These offenses usually occur under circumstances
in which there are no witnesses except for the accused and the
victim, and, because of this and the frequent delays in reporting,
there is often no evidence except for the conflicting testimony.
Moreover, there is frequently a reluctance on the part of others
to believe that the offenses occurred because of the inequality
between the victim and the perpetrator, such as between the child
victim and the adult accused, or because of the deviant and
distasteful nature of the charges. In addition, it is recognized
that some sex offenders cannot or will not respond to treatment
or otherwise resist the impulses which motivate such conduct and
that sex offenders are extremely habituated. As a result, such
offenders often commit numerous offenses involving sexual deviance
over many years, with the same or different victims, and often,
but not necessarily, through similar methods or by common design.
The general assembly reaffirms and reemphasizes that, in the
prosecution of sexual offenses, including in proving the corpus
delicti of such offenses, there is a greater need and propriety
for consideration by the fact finder of evidence of other relevant
acts of the accused, including any actions, crimes, wrongs, or
transactions, whether isolated acts or ongoing actions and whether
occurring prior to or after the charged offense. The general
assembly finds that such evidence of other sexual acts is
typically relevant and highly probative, and it is expected that
normally the probative value of such evidence will outweigh any
danger of unfair prejudice, even when incidents are remote from
one another in time.</M>
  <P N="(2)"></P>
  <T>(2)<M>This section applies to prosecution for any offense involving unlawful sexual
behavior as defined in section 16-22-102 (9), or first degree murder, as defined in section
18-3-102 (1)(d), C.R.S., in which the underlying felony on which the first degree murder
charge is based is the commission or attempted commission of sexual assault, as described

   <T>
    <B>Section not circumscribed by statute of limitation.</B> This section establishes
the criteria for admission of testimony relating to similar acts and should
not be circumscribed by a statute of limitation on sexual offenses. Adrian v.
People, 770 P.2d 1243 (Colo. 1989) (overruling Bigcraft v. People, 70 P. 417 (Colo.
1902);
Curtis v. People, 211 P. 381 (Colo. 1922); Abbott v. People, 299 P. 1053 (Colo. 1931);
People v. Denious, 196 P.2d 257 (Colo. 1948)).</T>
   <P></P>
   <T>
    <B>Guilt of one offense may not be proven by guilt of another.</B> It is
a fundamental concept of criminal law that an accused is not to be convicted
of one offense by proof that he is guilty of another. People v. Martin,
43 Colo. App. 44, 602 P.2d 873 (1979).</T>
   <P></P>
   <T>
    <B>"Acts or transactions" need not be criminal in nature.</B>
Subsection (1) refers to "acts or transactions", not to offenses or crimes,
and thus permits admission of evidence of events, not necessarily criminal
in nature, for the limited purposes specified. People v. Opson, 632 P.2d
602 (Colo. App. 1980);
People v. Girtman, 695 P.2d 759 (Colo. App. 1984).</T>
   <P></P>
   <T>
    <B>Admissibility of prior criminal transactions discretionary.</B>
The trial court has substantial discretion in deciding
the admissibility of evidence of a prior criminal transaction, and
only where there is an abuse of discretion will the ruling of the
trial court be disturbed. Pigford v. People, 197 Colo. 358,
593 P.2d 354 (1979);
People v. Delgado, 890 P.2d 141 (Colo. App.
1994).</T>
   <P></P>
   <T>
    <B>Evidence of prior criminal transactions not admissible where
defendant was acquitted of similar act.</B>
The doctrine of collateral estoppel prevents the introduction
of evidence of similar transactions for which a defendant has
been acquitted. People v. Arrington, 682 P.2d 490 (Colo. App. 1983).</T>
   <P></P>
   <T>
    <B>Collateral estoppel does not bar the introduction of prior act evidence relating to
charges of which defendant was previously acquitted</B> when it is presented in a
subsequent action where the admission of the evidence is governed by a lower standard
of
proof than the acquittal. People v. Wallen, 996 P.2d 182 (Colo. App. 1999) (disagreeing
with People v. Arrington, 682 P.2d 490 (Colo. App. 1983)).</T>
   <P></P>
   <T>
    <B>Evidence admissible that defendant did not commit other similar act.</B>
If all the similar acts and circumstances, taken together, may support a finding that the
same
person was probably involved in both
transactions, then evidence that the defendant did not commit the
second transaction is relevant and admissible. People v. Flowers, 644 P.2d 916 (Colo.
1982),
appeal
dismissed for want of substantial federal
question, 459 U.S. 803, 103 S. Ct. 25, 74 L. Ed. 2d 41 (1982).</T>
   <P></P>
   <T>
    <B>Admissibility decided on case-by-case basis.</B>
Admissibility of defensive similar offense evidence must be decided on a case-by-case
basis,
according to general relevancy considerations.
People v. Flowers, 644 P.2d 916 (Colo. 1982), appeal dismissed
for want of substantial federal question,
459 U.S. 803, 103 S. Ct. 25, 74 L. Ed. 2d 41 (1982);
People v. Montoya, 703 P.2d 606 (Colo. App. 1985).</T>
   <P></P>
   <T>
    <B>Exclusionary rule inapplicable when defendant offers similar offense
evidence.</B>
When a defendant offers similar offense evidence for
defensive reasons, the concerns which gave rise initially to
the exclusionary rule are no longer relevant. People v. Flowers, 644 P.2d 916
(Colo. 1982), appeal dismissed for want of substantial federal question, 459 U.S.
803, 103 S. Ct. 25, 74 L. Ed. 2d 41 (1982);
People v. Rollins, 892 P.2d 866 (Colo. 1995).</T>
   <P></P>
   <T>
    <B>Evidence of prior similar episodes is proper in sexual assault cases,</B>
regardless of whether the evidence of similar episodes relates to acts with persons other
than
the complaining witness and even if a prima facie case of the defendant's intent is first
established. People v. Pigford, 40 Colo. App. 523, 580 P.2d 820 (1978), aff'd, 197 Colo.
358, 593 P.2d 354 (1979); People v. Allen, 42 Colo. App. 345, 599 P.2d 264 (1979).</T>
   <P></P>
   <T>Evidence of prior similar transactions is admissible to prove, among other
things, plan, scheme, design, and motive, and this is particularly so in sexual
assault cases. People v. Vollentine, 643 P.2d 800 (Colo. App. 1982);
People v. Montoya, 703 P.2d 606 (Colo. App. 1985);
People v. Mosley, 167 P.3d 157 (Colo. App. 2007);
People v. Bondsteel, 2015 COA 165, 442 P.3d 880, aff'd, 2019 CO 26, 439 P.3d 847.</T>
   <P></P>
   <T>
    <B>Length of time between two acts.</B> In addition to the degree of
similarity between the earlier act and the act in question and the
relevance of the similar act, the trial court should consider the length of
time between the
two acts when deciding whether to admit evidence of a similar sexual
offense. An offense committed six years earlier is somewhat remote in time
and, considered in light of all the other evidence, would be unduly prejudicial
if admitted. People v. Wells, 754 P.2d 420 (Colo. App. 1987),
rev'd on other grounds, 776 P.2d 386 (Colo. 1989).</T>
   <P></P>
   <T>Considering the circumstances, prior incidents of sexual abuse
were not too remote
when there was interval of ten to twelve years between the childhood abuse
and the charges for which the defendant was being charged.
The defendant and the victim's mother were divorced during that period
and the defendant had had no contact with the victim for four years
and only limited contact with her thereafter.
People v. Fell, 832 P.2d 1015 (Colo. App. 1991).</T>
   <P></P>
   <T>There are few absolute rules on the number of years that can separate
two instances of conduct without destroying the evidentiary value of one.
People v. Adrian, 744 P.2d 768 (Colo. App. 1987),
aff'd, 770 P.2d 1243 (Colo. 1989);
People v. Fell, 832 P.2d 1015 (Colo. App. 1991).</T>
   <P></P>
   <T>
    <B>Offenses committed approximately ten to twelve years earlier are not too
remote in time</B> where the defendant and victim's mother were divorced and the
defendant had had no contact with the victim for four years and only
limited contact with her thereafter. Therefore, the prior incidents of sexual
abuse were not too remote in time, and, consequently, no undue prejudice to
defendant resulted from their admission. People v. Fell, 832 P.2d 1015 (Colo.
App. 1991).</T>
   <P></P>
   <T>The general assembly has expressed a policy of favoring the admission of other acts
evidence even when the incidents are remote from one another in time. People v. Shores,
2016 COA 129, 412 P.3d 894.</T>
   <P></P>
   <T>
    <B>Evidence of prior similar transactions is admissible</B> in cases of
sexual assault on a child if such evidence is offered to show a common
plan, scheme, design, identity, modus operandi, motive, guilty
knowledge, or intent. People v. Adrian, 744 P.2d 768 (Colo. App. 1987),
aff'd, 770 P.2d 1243 (Colo. 1989);
People v. Snyder, 874 P.2d 1076 (Colo. 1994);
People v. Nara, 964 P.2d 578 (Colo. App. 1998)
(decided under law in effect prior to the 1996 repeal and reenactment).</T>
   <P></P>
   <T>The testimony regarding prior similar acts by four witnesses was logically relevant to
defendant's identity and intent, apart from any inference of propensity, thus trial court did
not abuse its discretion in admitting it. People v. Larson, 97 P.3d 246 (Colo. App. 2004).</T>
   <P></P>
   <T>Trial court did not abuse discretion in admitting evidence of prior incident of sexual
assault on a child where incident had occurred eight years earlier, the evidence was
introduced only to prove identity, and the jury was instructed that identity was the only
purpose for which the evidence could be considered. People v. Apodaca, 58 P.3d 1126
(Colo. App. 2002).</T>
   <P></P>
   <T>
    <B>To refute the defense of recent fabrication,</B>
evidence of prior similar transactions is admissible in cases
of sexual assault on a child. People v. Duncan, 33 P.3d 1180 (Colo. App. 2001).</T>
   <P></P>
   <T>
    <B>To be admissible, the prior act evidence must</B> relate to a material fact, be
logically relevant, and be independent of the intermediate inference of bad character and
its
probative value must outweigh the danger of unfair prejudice. People v. Wallen, 996
P.2d
182 (Colo. App. 1999).</T>
   <P></P>
   <T>
    <B>This section, as reenacted in 1996, contains no language that erodes those
requirements or the requirement that the defendant engaged in the prior act.</B> Even
when evidence of prior similar transactions is introduced in prosecutions specifically
mentioned in this section, an analysis under C.R.E. 404(b) is still necessary. People v.
Martinez, 36 P.3d 154 (Colo. App. 2001).</T>
   <P></P>
   <T>
    <B>While it is error for the trial court to rule that this section supercedes previous
authority regarding the admissibility of prior similar transactions evidence,</B> reversal
is not required if the record supports the court's admission of such evidence under the
appropriate standard. People v. Martinez, 36 P.3d 154 (Colo. App. 2001).</T>
   <P></P>
   <T>
    <B>Prerequisites and factors to be considered by the trial court</B> in determining
whether to admit evidence of similar transactions are listed in State v. Janes, 942 P.2d
1331 (Colo. App. 1997).</T>
   <P></P>
   <T>
    <B>Evidence of prior similar transactions is admissible</B> in cases of sexual
assault regardless of the age of the victim. People v. Fell, 832 P.2d 1015 (Colo. App.
1991);
People v. Leonard, 872 P.2d 1325 (Colo. App. 1993).</T>
   <P></P>
   <T>
    <B>In order to introduce evidence of other sexual acts committed by the defendant,
the prosecution must satisfy, in addition to the requirements of this section, C.R.E.
404(b)
and the four-part test established in People v. Spoto.</B> People v. Underwood, 53 P.3d
765 (Colo. App. 2002); People v. Baker, 178 P.3d 1225 (Colo. App. 2007).</T>
   <P></P>
   <T>
    <B>Before admitting evidence of other crimes, wrongs, or acts, the other act
evidence must satisfy C.R.E. 404(b) and the test in People v. Spoto, 795 P.2d 1314
(Colo. 1990).</B> People v. Villa, 240 P.3d 343 (Colo. App. 2009); People v. Glasser,
293
P.3d 68 (Colo. App. 2011).</T>
   <P></P>
   <T>
    <B>Evidence of prior similar transactions</B> is admissible when used to prove
identity and motive and to rebut a defense of fabrication by a victim. Evidence
introduced under the requirements of this section and C.R.E. 404(b) that fails to satisfy
these requirements may be disregarded as harmless error if the error is not one of
constitutional dimension and the defendant fails to show a reasonable probability that the
inadmissible detail contributed to his or her conviction. People v. Whitlock, 2014 COA
162, 412 P.3d 667.</T>
   <P></P>
   <T>
    <B>Trial courts have no obligation to determine that evidence of other acts offered
under C.R.E. 404(b) and this section satisfies the doctrine of chances to also satisfy the
second and third prongs of the four-part admissibility test articulated in People v.
Spoto.</B> Although the doctrine of chances provides one theory pursuant to which
other acts evidence may satisfy these two components of that four-part analysis, trial
courts have discretion to assess the relevance of other acts evidence under People v.
Spoto apart from the doctrine of chances. People v. Jones, 2013 CO 59, 311 P.3d 274.</T>
   <P></P>
   <T>
    <B>Defendant does not necessarily have the right to cross-examine a witness in an
evidentiary hearing pursuant to this section.</B> People v. Baker, 178 P.3d 1225 (Colo.
App. 2007).</T>
   <P></P>
   <T>
    <B>Prosecutor's comment that evidence of prior similar transactions between
the sexual assault victim and the defendant, her father, explained the
victim's response to two
assaults and her failure to report them earlier is not improper</B>
considering the testimony of the victim and the limiting instructions given
by the trial court regarding the proper use of the similar transaction
evidence. People v. Fell, 832 P.2d 1015 (Colo. App. 1991).</T>
   <P></P>
   <T>
    <B>Evidence of similar transactions in an incest case</B> is admissible where
there is sufficient and substantial similarity between the transactions and
offense charged even though there were differences in the type of sexual
activity. The evidence is also admissible on the issue of motive, and the
trial court was not required to define motive for the jury. People v.
Leonard, 872 P.2d 1325 (Colo. App. 1993).</T>
   <P></P>
   <T>
    <B>Where the similar transaction to be admitted is complex, requiring
several steps to completion, a single prior act may be sufficient to
demonstrate a common plan.</B> In such a case, the risks of abuse may be
reduced by requiring that the methods used in the commission of the acts being
compared must be both similar to each other and dissimilar from the methods
generally used in such an offense. People v. Delgado, 890 P.2d 141 (Colo. App.
1994).</T>
   <P></P>
   <T>
    <B>A contemporaneous limiting instruction is not required</B> to permit
evidence of similar transactions to be considered by the jury where the trial
court instructed in the general charge to the jury that they consider the
evidence only to show common plan, scheme, or design and where the
prosecution was allowed to wait until the close of the case to elect which
specific transactions it was prosecuting. People v. Cordova, 854 P.2d 1337
(Colo. App. 1992), aff'd, 880 P.2d 1216 (Colo. 1994).</T>
   <P></P>
   <T>
    <B>Failure to give limiting instruction does not always constitute plain error.</B>
The court must examine all of the particular facts to determine if plain error was
committed. People v. Underwood, 53 P.3d 765 (Colo. App. 2002).</T>
   <P></P>
   <T>
    <B>Trial court's failure to issue a limiting instruction in its final instruction to the
jury was not plain error.</B> The error was not substantial, did not affect defendant's
substantial rights, and the error did not undermine the fairness of the trial to a significant
degree. The court issued a limiting instruction at the time of the introduction of the
evidence and the court's final instructions reminded the jury about that instruction even
though it was not specific to the particular evidence. People v. Everett, 250 P.3d 649
(Colo.
App. 2010).</T>
   <P></P>
   <T>
    <B>To prove common plan, scheme, or design.</B>
Evidence of prior sexual episodes with the victim which goes to prove a
common plan, scheme, or design, is admissible under subsection (1). People
v. Whitesel, 200 Colo. 362, 615 P.2d 678 (1980).</T>
   <P></P>
   <T>Evidence of prior sexual episode with a different victim that goes to prove a
common plan and a pattern of using a particular technique to accomplish a particular end
is admissible under subsection (1). People v. Shores, 2016 COA 129, 412 P.3d 894.</T>
   <P></P>
   <T>
    <B>Statute mandates that, at time of reception into evidence and again in
general charge to the jury,</B> the trial court shall direct the jury as to
the limited purpose for which such evidence is admitted. People
v. Roberts, 738 P.2d 380 (Colo. App. 1986).</T>
   <P></P>
   <T>
    <B>Language of subsection (3) is mandatory</B> and the trial judge may not
omit the instructions, even though the defendant objects to them as prejudicial
rather than prophylactic. People v. Opson, 632 P.2d 602 (Colo. App. 1980).</T>
   <P></P>
   <T>
    <B>Defendant denied fair trial by introduction of prejudicial testimony.</B>
Where testimony given in answer to a prosecutor's question revealed an unsavory
situation of a highly prejudicial character and was without probative value
relevant to the offenses charged, and where no limiting instructions were
given, defendant was denied a fair trial. People v. Martin, 43 Colo. App.
44, 602 P.2d 873 (1979).</T>

   <P></P>
   <T>
    <B>Trial court did not abuse its discretion when it joined two sexual assault cases
against defendant involving two victims, his daughters.</B> The evidence from each
case
would have been admissible in the other case, the evidence was material to defendant's
intent and common plan, and the evidence made it more likely defendant committed the
crimes. Defendant's claim that he would have testified in one case, but not the other,
making joinder improper did not rise to the level of prejudice. Defendant was still able to
show the jury a police interview in which he claimed the same intoxication defense he
claimed he would have testified to had the charges involving the other victim been tried
separately. People v. Curtis, 2014 COA 100, 350 P.3d 949.</T>
   <P></P>
   <T>
    <B>Trial court did not abuse its discretion in admitting evidence regarding prior
similar acts.</B> The testimony was logically relevant to defendant's identity and intent,
apart from any inference of propensity; the probative value of the evidence was not
substantially outweighed by the danger of unfair prejudice; and the court gave detailed
instructions to the jury multiple times that articulated the proper use of the evidence.

   <P></P>
   <T>
    <B>Court properly admitted previous incident evidence based on imprecise offer of

   <P></P>
   <T>
    <B>Trial court could not admit evidence of alleged sexual assault under this section
then in effect before prosecution presented prima facie case to jury.</B> Yet child's
out-of-court statements could not establish a prima facie case warranting submission to
the
jury because, under § 13-25-129(1)(b), the statements were not admissible without
the
corroborative evidence. People v. Nara, 964 P.2d 578 (Colo. App. 1998) (decided under
law
in effect prior to the 1996 repeal and reenactment).</T>
   <P></P>
   <T>As a result of the interplay of § 13-25-129 and this section then in effect,
alleged
victim's out-of-court statements could not be corroborated by similar acts, and those
statements could not provide the prima facie case necessary for admission of evidence of
the

disposition of a felony, misdemeanor, petty offense, traffic offense, or traffic infraction
and does not pay all amounts assessed in full on the date of the assessment, the defendant
shall pay to the clerk of the court an additional time payment fee of twenty-five dollars.
The time payment fee may be assessed once per case; except that, if amounts owed in the
case have still not been paid in full one
year after the date of the assessment, the fee may be assessed annually until the defendant
has fully satisfied his or her financial obligation in the case. In addition, there may be
assessed against a defendant a late penalty fee of ten dollars each time a payment toward
the fines, fees, costs, surcharges, or other amounts owed is not received on or before the
date due. If the court determines that the defendant does not have the financial resources
to pay a time payment fee or a late penalty fee, the court may waive or suspend a time
payment fee or a late penalty fee. Amounts collected are credited first against the time
payment and any late penalty fees assessed under this subsection (1), then against any
fines, and finally against any costs. The time payment fee and late penalty fee described
in this subsection (1) do not apply to a person under the jurisdiction of the juvenile court

   <P></P>
   <T>Trial court erred by proceeding to sentencing without a presentence investigation
report
("PSIR"). The plain language of this section requires the preparation of a PSIR before
sentencing, unless both the defendant and the prosecution agree to proceed to sentencing
without the benefit of such a report. Here, the prosecution specifically requested that a
PSIR
be prepared, and objected to the court's proceeding to sentencing without one. The
prosecution thus did not waive the statutory requirement that the PSIR be prepared
before
the imposition of sentence. People v. Gretz, 973 P.2d 110 (Colo. App. 1998).</T>

sentence, is to be advised by a written report from the probation officer of
any prior criminal record of the defendant and of such information about his
characteristics, his financial condition, and circumstances affecting his behavior,

determining the advisability of granting probation, or as may be helpful in

   <T>
    <B>Remand for presentation of evidence in rebuttal to report.</B>
Where the presentence report is issued to counsel immediately prior to sentencing, and
the
trial court's refusal to continue the sentencing
hearing to another day unduly abridges the defendant's
rights to present evidence in rebuttal to the information and recommendations
contained in the report, his sentence must be vacated and the case
remanded for resentencing after a full sentencing hearing.
People v. Wright, 672 P.2d 518 (Colo. 1983).</T>
   <P></P>
   <T>
    <B>Court erred in relying for sentencing purposes upon information and evidence

2004).</T>
   <P></P>
   <T>
    <B>Error by the court to proceed to sentencing defendant without report was
harmless</B> where defendant refused to be interviewed by probation officer, neither

defendant failed to allege on appeal how he was prejudiced by absence of report. People

Logan v. People ex rel. Alamosa County, 138 Colo. 304, 332 P.2d 897 (1958).</T>
   <P></P>
   <T>
    <B>Trial court could impose restitution under this section and § 17-2-201 as a
condition of parole,</B> even though the restitution provisions
of § 16-11-204.5 did not apply since the defendant
pleaded guilty to theft by receiving and was not sentenced to probation. People v.
Schmidt,
700
P.2d 925 (Colo. App. 1985).</T>
   <P></P>
   <T>
    <B>Sentence of incarceration precludes order of restitution,</B> but at time of
sentencing,
court may set amount of restitution for later
consideration by parole board when board sets conditions for parole under §
17-2-201.
People v. Powell, 748 P.2d 1355 (Colo. App. 1987).</T>
   <P></P>
   <T>
    <B>This section does not authorize the court to impose restitution</B> unless
authorized pursuant to another statutory provision. People v. Young, 710 P.2d
1140 (Colo. App. 1985) (decided prior to 1996 amendment to subsection (4)).</T>
   <P></P>
   <T>
    <B>Subsection (4), as amended in 1996, requires courts to impose restitution at the
time
of sentencing,</B> even where a defendant is sentenced to incarceration. People v.
Tipton,
973 P.2d 713 (Colo. App. 1998); People v. Apodaca, 998 P.2d 25 (Colo. App. 1999).</T>
   <P></P>
   <T>
    <B>When an offense requires proof of the identity of a particular victim, the court
may
not order restitution to another.</B> Defendant who pled guilty to a single count of theft
in
return for a dismissal of other counts may not be ordered to pay restitution to the victims
in
the counts that were dismissed. People v. Armijo, 989 P.2d 224 (Colo. App. 1999).</T>
   <P></P>
   <T>
    <B>A codefendant is jointly responsible for restitution</B> when he is also a
complicitor in the crime. People v. Fichtner, 869 P.2d 539 (Colo. 1994).</T>
   <P></P>
   <T>
    <B>Codefendants were participants and complicitors in the same criminal
acts,</B> therefore, each is responsible for the damage he caused and also for
the damage caused by the other. People v. Fichtner, 869 P.2d 539 (Colo.
1994).</T>
   <P></P>
   <T>
    <B>The sentencing court is required to fix the defendant's criminal
liability for restitution</B> by considering the victim's actual monetary
losses and, where appropriate, to temper the defendant's restitution
obligation by considering his financial ability to pay and his duty of
support owed to his dependents and any other outstanding family
responsibilities. The statutory scheme, in other words, does not require
the sentencing court to determine a defendant's criminal liability for
restitution in accordance with the strict rules of damages applicable to a
civil case. People v. Johnson, 780 P.2d 504 (Colo. 1989);
People v. Duran, 991 P.2d 313 (Colo. App. 1999).</T>
   <P></P>
   <T>
    <B>An order of restitution becomes part of the sentence</B> which, in
accordance with Crim. P. 32(c), is part of the judgment of conviction.
When a court orders a defendant, over his objection, to pay restitution
to the victim or
the victim's family as part of the judgment of conviction for a felony, the
order of restitution is appealable pursuant to the statutory procedures
applicable to the appellate review of a felony sentence.
People v. Johnson, 780 P.2d 504 (Colo. 1989).</T>
   <P></P>
   <T>
    <B>An order increasing the amount of restitution has the effect of increasing the
punishment originally imposed.</B> Therefore, because restitution is a part of the
criminal
sentence, once a legal sentence is imposed and a defendant has begun serving it, an
increase
in the amount of restitution ordered also violates the constitutional prohibition against
double
jeopardy. People v. Shepard, 989 P.2d 183 (Colo. App. 1999).</T>
   <P></P>
   <T>
    <B>Statute provides no right to offender to present evidence of ability to
pay restitution during revocation hearing</B> when hearing is based on other
grounds. People v. McCarty, 851 P.2d 181 (Colo. App. 1992).</T>
   <P></P>
   <T>
    <B>Order requiring defendant to pay restitution for one-half of
the value of property missing from the truck involved in defendant's
conviction for theft by receiving was improper.</B> There was no
evidence linking the defendant's conduct of theft by receiving the
stolen truck and the missing personal property from the truck. The
trial court's order, based on speculation, was improper. People v.
Randolph, 852 P.2d 1282 (Colo. App. 1992).</T>
   <P></P>
   <T>
    <B>Although a trial court may establish restitution pursuant to
this section,</B> it may not establish the method of payment for
restitution. People v. Randolph, 852 P.2d 1282 (Colo. App. 1992);
People v. Strock, 931 P.2d 538 (Colo. App. 1996).</T>
   <P></P>
   <T>The manner and time of payment of restitution is exclusively within the jurisdiction
of the parole board. People v. Strock, 931 P.2d 538 (Colo. App. 1996).</T>
   <P></P>
   <T>
    <B>The general assembly did not intend to give absolute
discretion to a court</B> to comply or not to comply with what appear to
be mandatory requirements of a presentence report. People v.
Valencia, 888 P.2d 319 (Colo. App. 1994),
aff'd, 906 P.2d 115 (Colo. 1995).</T>
   <P></P>
   <T>
    <B>The record of the sentencing hearing must include at least a summary of the
information relied upon by the sentencing court but not contained in the presentence
report.</B> Absent such a record, no meaningful appellate review of the sentence is
possible. People v. Pourat, 100 P.3d 503 (Colo. App. 2004).</T>
   <P></P>
   <T>
    <B>Because the trial court did not set forth any reasons for its
waiver of statutory requirements,</B> the defendant's presentence report
did not comport with the requirements of this section. People v.
Valencia, 888 P.2d 319 (Colo. App. 1994).</T>
   <P></P>
   <T>
    <B>Prior to sentencing, the court must grant the defendant an opportunity to
make a statement on his or her own behalf.</B> The proper remedy for failing to
allow the defendant to make a statement is resentencing. People v. Marquantte, 923 P.2d
180 (Colo. App. 1995); People v. Perea, 74 P.3d 326 (Colo. App. 2002).</T>
   <P></P>
   <T>
    <B>Failure to afford defendant an opportunity to speak amounts to plain error where
the court did not directly address the defendant or personally invite him to speak.</B>
The court's inquiry whether "other people in the court" wanted to speak was clearly
directed to the nonparties in attendance, not to the defendant. People v. Smalley, 2015
COA 140, 369 P.3d 737.</T>
   <P></P>
   <T>
    <B>However, the right of allocution is a statutory right, not a constitutional one, and
reversal is not required if the failure to provide the defendant an opportunity to make a
statement prior to sentencing is harmless.</B> If a trial court imposes the minimum
sentence permitted and does not have discretion to impose a lesser sentence, the lack of a
statement in allocution does not affect the sentence and is harmless. People v. Martinez,
83 P.3d 1174 (Colo. App. 2003).</T>
   <P></P>
   <T>
    <B>Defendant's right of allocution was not improperly withheld</B> where court
asked defense counsel if defendant wished to make a statement to the court,
but counsel proceeded to argument. People v. Loyd, 902 P.2d 889 (Colo. App.
1995).</T>
   <P></P>
   <T>
    <B>When the court dispenses with the presentence report,</B> the probation
department, within seventy-two hours prior to the sentencing hearing,
should provide the prosecuting attorney and defense counsel, or the
defendant if unrepresented, with a copy of the victim impact statement
setting forth the amount of the victim's claimed monetary damages and the
amount of restitution for which the defendant may be responsible. At the
sentencing hearing the
defendant must be given the opportunity to controvert the victim's claimed
monetary damages. People v. Johnson, 780 P.2d 504 (Colo. 1989).</T>
   <P></P>
   <T>
    <B>"Victim" construed.</B>
The transfer of stolen property to a bona fide purchaser necessarily victimizes
the purchaser since his interests must yield to the title of the rightful
owner. Therefore, the bona fide purchaser of
stolen property was a victim for purposes of ordering restitution and the
trial court properly included in the amount of restitution an amount to
reimburse the purchaser, an antique dealer, for
expenses for restoration of the property. People v. Schmidt, 700 P.2d 925
(Colo. App. 1985).</T>

    <B>Subsection (4) limitation inapplicable to deferred sentence revocation
proceeding.</B>
Since the five-day limitation specified in subsection (4) is not a procedural safeguard
required in

requirement
imposed on the probation officer, it is not within the contemplation of § 16-7-403

App.
1997).</T>
   <P></P>
   <T>To toll the probation period until probation revocation proceedings are completed, it
is
sufficient that: (1) A probation officer issue a summons requiring the probationer to
appear
in court; (2) a probation officer arrest the probationer; (3) a complaint be filed for the
revocation of probation; or (4) a report be filed by a probation officer or a verified
complaint
by any person, together with a request for an arrest warrant. People v. Galvin, 961 P.2d

   <T>
    <B>Subsection (5) does not specify particular format for complaint alleging
violation
of probation.</B> The constitutional sufficiency of notice to a probationer that is
written,

sufficiently
fulfilled the central function of informing the probationer of the alleged basis for
revocation. The original revocation complaint served on the probationer did not specify
that the revocation was based upon conviction for a murder the probationer committed
while on probation, but instead included the original charges filed. The probationer
received constitutionally sufficient written notice, however, in a motion to continue the
revocation hearing that explicitly identified the murder conviction as a ground for
revocation. People v. Robles, 209 P.3d 1173 (Colo. App. 2009).</T>

    <B>Scope of probationer's constitutional rights.</B>
Upon a probation revocation hearing the probationer is not entitled

28 (1969); People v. Atencio, 186 Colo. 76, 525 P.2d 461 (1974).</T>
   <P></P>
   <T>While the defendant is entitled to certain procedural
due process rights at a probation revocation hearing, he is
not entitled to the full panoply of constitutional guarantees
available to one who has not been convicted of a crime, and thus
cannot complain of the admission of illegally seized evidence.
People v. Wilkerson, 189 Colo. 448, 541 P.2d 896 (1975).</T>
   <P></P>
   <T>
    <B>The following "minimum requirements of due process" at parole or
probation revocation hearings are required:</B> (1) Written notice of the
claimed violations of probation; (2) disclosure to the probationer of evidence
against him; (3) opportunity to be heard in person and to present
witnesses and documentary evidence; (4) the right to confront and cross-examine
adverse witnesses (unless the hearing officer specifically finds good cause
for not allowing confrontation); (5) a "neutral and detached" hearing body
such as a traditional parole board, members of which need not be judicial
officers or lawyers; and (6) a written statement by the fact finders as to
the evidence relied on and reasons for revoking probation. People v.

    <B>Issue preclusion does not apply to bar the right of a defendant to a trial</B>
where
defendant had been charged with the crime of driving with a revoked license, which
constituted both a violation of his probation and a new criminal act. Defendant did not
have
a full and fair opportunity to litigate the issue in the probation revocation hearing. A
determination of guilt or innocence in a probation revocation hearing would undermine
the
function of the criminal trial process. Byrd v. People, 58 P.3d 50 (Colo. 2002).</T>
   <P></P>
   <T>Probation revocation hearings are held for different purposes, governed by different

    <B>Continuance of hearing not reversed absent abuse of discretion.</B>
A finding of good cause for a continuance is within the discretion of the

People v. Marrow, 638 P.2d 842 (Colo. App. 1981).</T>
   <P></P>
   <T>
    <B>Abuse not found.</B>
Where a court ordered a continuance in view of the late filing of an amended
complaint against defendant and the defendant's need for additional time
to respond to the allegations in the amended complaint, there was no abuse
of discretion. People v. Marrow, 638 P.2d 842 (Colo. App. 1981).</T>
   <P></P>
   <T>
    <B>What constitutes prejudice in denial of continuance at hearing.</B>
When a continuance of a sentencing hearing for revocation of probation is denied, the
trial
court
will not be held to have abused its discretion
unless the defendant demonstrates prejudice resulting
from the failure to continue. Where the defendant subsequently pleads guilty to the
charge
for
which probation was revoked, he fails to establish prejudice.

probation has been breached, even though the breaching conduct also may have
constituted
a criminal offense. People v. Moses, 64 P.3d 904 (Colo. App. 2002).</T>
   <P></P>
   <T>
    <B>Burden of establishing violation.</B> Where an alleged violation of a condition
of
probation is a criminal
offense, the prosecution has the burden of establishing the violation
beyond a reasonable doubt. People v. Carr, 185 Colo. 293,
524 P.2d 301 (1974).</T>
   <P></P>

    <B>Subsection (3) is based on a defendant's being subsequently convicted of a
crime, not receiving a judgment of conviction.</B> People v. Blackwell, 2016 COA 136,
409 P.3d 558.</T>
   <P></P>
   <T>
    <B>Under subsection (3), once the prosecution shows that a defendant has not paid
restitution, the burden shifts to the defendant</B> to show that he or she was unable to
pay. People v. Roletto, 2015 COA 41, 370 P.3d 190.</T>
   <P></P>
   <T>
    <B>Beyond reasonable doubt standard of proof.</B> An adult
charged with a probation violation which constitutes a criminal
offense has the right to demand that the people's charge
that he committed the crime relied upon as a probation violation
be proved "beyond a reasonable doubt".

   <P></P>
   <T>
    <B>Defendant's plea constitutes a conviction within the meaning of subsection
(3).</B> Court does not have to find reasonable doubt that defendant violated the law
because the court's acceptance of defendant's guilty plea amounted to a conviction and a
violation of the terms of defendant's deferred judgment. People v. Blackwell, 2016 COA
136, 409 P.3d 558.</T>
   <P></P>
   <T>
    <B>Presumption that court applied proper standard of proof.</B> Although
the court did not articulate the standard of proof it applied in
revoking probation, the court is entitled to a presumption that it
applied the proper standard. People v. Carr, 185 Colo. 293,
524 P.2d 301 (1974).</T>
   <P></P>
   <T>
    <B>Plea of not guilty by reason of insanity not allowed in
probation revocation hearing.</B>
A court, in permitting a plea of "not guilty by reason of insanity" in
a probation revocation hearing, exceeds its jurisdiction, as a plea
of not guilty by reason of insanity is not a proper means
of testing competency at a probation revocation hearing.
People ex rel. Gallagher v. District Court, 196 Colo. 499,

   <P></P>
   <T>
    <B>Formal procedures and rules of evidence not employed.</B>
One of the critical differences between criminal trials and probation
revocation hearings is that formal procedures and rules of evidence
are not employed. People v. Atencio, 186 Colo. 76,
525 P.2d 461 (1974).</T>
   <P></P>
   <T>
    <B>Hearing may be informally conducted.</B> Where a hearing to
revoke probation is called for by statute, it may be informally conducted.
Gehl v. People, 161 Colo. 535, 423 P.2d 332 (1967).</T>
   <P></P>
   <T>A hearing must be held on a petition to revoke probation.
But the hearing may be informally conducted, and the court may take
into consideration all factors normally taken into account during sentencing.

   <P></P>
   <T>
    <B>Two-month delay in scheduling of hearing for probation
revocation under subsection (4) did not violate defendant's due
process rights.</B> Much of the delay was caused by defendant's failure
to inform his defense counsel or the court of his whereabouts, and
final two months of delay do not constitute a sufficient time
interval to warrant a conclusion that the delay was excessive.
Defendant has failed to demonstrate that he has suffered any other
prejudice. People v. Newman, 867 P.2d 94 (Colo. App. 1993).</T>
   <P></P>
   <T>
    <B>Proper sanction for violation of subsection (4)</B>
is release of the probationer from custody, and not dismissal of the petition.

People v. Newman, 867 P.2d 94 (Colo. App. 1993).</T>
   <P></P>
   <T>If an alleged probation violator has been held in custody up to the statutory
time limit and has not had a hearing, he must be immediately released from
custody, but the complaint may remain pending
or be refiled. Only custody is forfeited if a hearing is not held in time. People v. Clark,
654
P.2d
847 (Colo. 1982).</T>
   <P></P>
   <T>
    <B>Speedy disposition of revocation petition applies to juveniles.</B>
The speedy disposition of a revocation petition, guaranteed to adults under
subsection (4), must be extended to juveniles. People in Interest of D.M.,
650 P.2d 1350 (Colo. App. 1982).</T>
   <P></P>
   <T>
    <B>Delay attributable to court calendar congestion</B>
may be a permissible cause for delay under subsection (4).
People in Interest of D.M., 650 P.2d 1350 (Colo. App. 1982).</T>
   <P></P>
   <T>
    <B>Prosecution has burden of proving that docket congestion is sufficiently
egregious</B> as to be good cause for the delay. People in Interest of D.M.,
650 P.2d 1350 (Colo. App. 1982).</T>
   <P></P>
   <T>
    <B>Fifteen-day limitation applies to deferred sentence revocation hearing.</B>
Since the 15-day limitation imposed by subsection (4) is a procedural safeguard required
for
probation revocation hearings, it applies to a
deferred sentence revocation pursuant to § 16-7-403.
People v. Schoonover, 654 P.2d 1340 (Colo. App. 1982).</T>
   <P></P>
   <T>
    <B>It is not bound by strict rules of evidence.</B> In a proceeding to
determine whether probation should be revoked, the court will not be bound
by the strict rules of evidence. The probation officer was subject
to cross-examination regarding the hearsay evidence which he offered,
and such was not an abuse of discretion by the trial court.
Holdren v. People, 168 Colo. 474, 452 P.2d 28 (1969).</T>

   <P></P>
   <T>A probation violation may be established by hearsay testimony if the offering
witness
is subject to cross-examination. People v. Moses, 64 P.3d 904 (Colo. App. 2002).</T>

   <T>Triple hearsay may be sufficient to prove a violation of a condition of probation as

    <B>Permitting probation officer to testify about hearsay was harmless beyond a

   <P></P>
   <T>
    <B>Since defendant knew that failure to meet conditions of probation might
constitute extraordinary aggravating circumstances</B> which would justify
sentencing beyond the presumptive range, the court was justified in doubling
of presumptive range of sentence when defendant met neither the community
service
nor the restitution condition of probation. Montoya v. People, 864 P.2d 1093
(Colo. 1993).</T>
   <P></P>
   <T>
    <B>Where the only witness lacks personal knowledge of the essential
incriminating facts supporting the revocation of probation,</B> the probationer
cannot be provided the fair opportunity to rebut as required by the statute.
People in Interest of T.M.H., 821 P.2d 895 (Colo. App. 1991).</T>
   <P></P>
   <T>
    <B>Defendant had a fair opportunity to rebut hearsay evidence offered at parole
revocation hearing.</B> Although the probation officer did not know the identity of the
sheriff deputy that said that defendant's roommate had said defendant did not live at their
residence any longer, defendant did know the identity of his roommate. Defendant, thus,
had an opportunity to rebut the statement of his roommate. People v. Ruch, 2013 COA
96, 374 P.3d 485, rev'd on other grounds, 2016 CO 35, 379 P.3d 309.</T>
   <P></P>
   <T>
    <B>After acceptance of an Alford plea, court can revoke probation for failure to
complete counseling that requires defendant to admit guilt.</B> Prior to accepting plea,
court must advise defendant of direct consequences of the conviction to satisfy due
process
concerns. Possibility that required counseling could not be completed and that probation
would be revoked if the defendant did not admit guilt, is a collateral consequence of the
guilty plea. People v. Birdsong, 958 P.2d 1124 (Colo. 1998).</T>
   <P></P>
   <T>
    <B>The trial court's finding that the defendant did not
participate or cooperate in a sex offender treatment program</B> was
supported by evidence demonstrating that the defendant's test
results, interviews, and behavior in the program entrance process
convinced the treatment program's personnel that the defendant was
not motivated for treatment, was not giving straightforward answers
to questions, was not prepared to accept responsibility for his
crime, and was not amenable to outpatient treatment. People v.
Ickler, 877 P.2d 863 (Colo. 1994).</T>
   <P></P>
   <T>
    <B>Exclusionary rule not applied in probation revocation hearing.</B>
The overwhelming majority of cases from state and federal jurisdictions have
refused to apply the exclusionary rule to improperly seized evidence in
probation revocation hearings. People v. Atencio, 186 Colo. 76,
525 P.2d 461 (1974).</T>
   <P></P>
   <T>In the absence of egregious police misconduct, the exclusionary rule is
inapplicable to probation revocation proceedings. People v. Ressin, 620
P.2d 717 (Colo. 1980).</T>
   <P></P>
   <T>
    <B>And the general assembly clearly expressed its intent to have
all probative evidence considered</B> at the hearing on probation
revocation, even if that evidence would be excluded in a criminal trial.
People v. Atencio, 186 Colo. 76,
525 P.2d 461 (1974).</T>
   <P></P>
   <T>Subsection (3) is merely a codification of the general
policy that the exclusionary rule does not apply to
improperly seized evidence in probation revocation hearings.
People v. Wilkerson, 189 Colo. 448, 541 P.2d 896 (1975).</T>
   <P></P>
   <T>
    <B>The U.S. supreme court's decision in Crawford v. Washington, 541 U.S. 36
(2004),
does not change the rule that a probation violation can be established by hearsay
evidence, so long as the offering witness is subject to cross-examination.</B> The right
to confrontation in a probation revocation hearing flows from the due process clause, not
the confrontation clause upon which the Crawford court relied. People v. Turley, 109
P.3d
1025 (Colo. App. 2004).</T>
   <P></P>
   <T>
    <B>Defendant deprived of due process right of confrontation during revocation
hearing.</B> There was no good cause to deny confrontation or find that the
prosecution's hearsay evidence was substantially reliable. The hearsay evidence was
unreliable, consisting of double or triple hearsay, and did not fall within any recognized
exception to the hearsay rule. People v. Loveall, 203 P.3d 540 (Colo. App. 2008), aff'd,
231 P.3d 408 (Colo. 2010).</T>
   <P></P>
   <T>
    <B>Defendant not deprived of due process right of confrontation during revocation
hearing.</B> Because defendant conceded that he had not made the necessary restitution
payments, the court's belief that jobs were generally available was peripheral to the
contested issue; therefore, the newspaper was not used to prove that defendant had
violated his probation. People v. Roletto, 2015 COA 41, 370 P.3d 190.</T>
   <P></P>
   <T>
    <B>"Convicted" defined.</B> For the purposes of probation
revocation under subsection (3) of this section, the term convicted
means convicted upon trial, not when all appellate remedies are
exhausted.

   <P></P>
   <T>
    <B>But gross official misconduct in gathering evidence not sanctioned.</B>
Although the exclusionary rule per se does not apply to probation
revocation hearings, gross official misconduct in gathering evidence
for a probation revocation will not be sanctioned where an unreasonable
search or seizure is such as to shock the conscience of the court. The
court will not permit such conduct to be the basis of a state-imposed
sanction. People v. Atencio, 186 Colo. 76,
525 P.2d 461 (1974).</T>
   <P></P>
   <T>While the exclusionary rule per se is inapplicable
to probation revocation hearings, gross official misconduct by
law enforcement officers is not condoned. People v. Wilkerson, 189
Colo. 448, 541 P.2d 896 (1975).</T>
   <P></P>
   <T>
    <B>Court not bound to apply original sentence upon revocation of probation.</B>
Because suspension of a sentence is in conjunction with, rather than contradistinction to,
the imposition of a statutorily prescribed alternative to imprisonment, the sentencing
court's resentencing options upon revocation were dictated by statutory provisions
governing revocation of probation. Fierro v. People, 206 P.3d 460 (Colo. 2009).</T>
   <P></P>
   <T>
    <B>Revocation without notice improper.</B> A trial judge has no
power to impose sentence upon the basis of a violation of the conditions
of probation in the absence of any notice to the probationer that his
probation had been extended beyond the original period. Such a
sentence violates concepts of fundamental fairness and
due process. Jesseph v. People, 164 Colo. 312, 435 P.2d 224 (1967).</T>
   <P></P>
   <T>
    <B>Where probation conditioned upon child support, finding of ability
to pay required</B> before revocation, and such finding should be made by the
trial court. People v. Silcott, 177 Colo. 451, 494 P.2d 835 (1972).</T>
   <P></P>
   <T>
    <B>Requiring the court to either revoke or continue probation within five days of
the
hearing on revocation is a directory provision, not jurisdictional.</B> There is no basis
for reversing the court's revocation of probation when the defendant consented to a
hearing outside the statutory time period and the timing did not affect the fairness of the
proceeding or cast doubt on the reliability of the outcome. People v. Heimann, 186 P.3d
77
(Colo. App. 2007).</T>
   <P></P>
   <T>
    <B>Failure to follow statutory procedure voids revocation.</B>
The statutory procedure for hearing and revocation was not followed and
no evidence was presented to show that defendant had violated any of
the terms of his probation. Defendant's application for
counsel to initiate appeal proceedings was not inconsistent with
probation. Snook v. People, 169 Colo. 95, 453 P.2d 806 (1969).</T>
   <P></P>
   <T>
    <B>District court did not advise defendant of the charges against him and the
possible penalties pursuant to subsection (2) or comply with § 18-1.3-1010 (2).</B>
The court's lack of advisement and failure to follow the statutes constitutes plain error
and requires reversal of the probation revocation. People v. Helms, 2016 COA 90, 396
P.3d 1133.</T>
   <P></P>
   <T>
    <B>Revocation held fundamentally unfair.</B> It was fundamentally unfair
to accept child support payments for a period of six months and then use as a
ground for revocation of probation defendant's failure to make payments
prior to that period. People v. Silcott, 177 Colo. 451, 494 P.2d 835 (1972).</T>
   <P></P>
   <T>
    <B>Authority of court to impose sentence upon revocation.</B> Upon revocation,
the trial court has full authority to impose a sentence within the minimum and
maximum term provided by statute for the crime. Gehl v. People, 161 Colo.
535, 423 P.2d 332 (1967).</T>
   <P></P>
   <T>
    <B>Consecutive sentencing</B>
is an appropriate mechanism for imposing a distinct punishment for each
of two criminal acts. People v. Lorenzo, 644 P.2d 50 (Colo. App. 1981).</T>
   <P></P>
   <T>The words "which might have originally been imposed or granted"
in subsection (5) mean that the later imposition of sentence shall be done in accordance
with
the
law applicable at the time defendant was
originally placed on probation, and they do not mandate
concurrent rather than consecutive sentencing. People v. Lorenzo, 644 P.2d
50 (Colo. App. 1981).</T>
   <P></P>
   <T>
    <B>Time on probation need not be credited against sentence.</B>
The granting of probation is not the imposition of sentence or its
equivalent, and time served on probation need not be credited against
a sentence imposed upon revocation. Gehl v. People, 161 Colo. 535, 423 P.2d
332 (1967).</T>

   <P></P>
   <T>
    <B>A penitentiary sentence is more severe than a reformatory sentence</B> under
Colorado law because
it carries the stigma of a felony. Petsche v. Clingan, 273 F.2d 688 (10th Cir.
1960).</T>
   <P></P>
   <T>
    <B>Sentence to reformatory within discretion of judge.</B> Where a defendant is
less than 21
years of age at the time of sentence, a trial judge is vested with a discretion
to sentence him to the
reformatory or the state penitentiary. McKinney v. People, 138 Colo. 294, 332
P.2d 895 (1958).</T>
   <P></P>
   <T>Under this section persons convicted of a crime punishable by imprisonment in
the penitentiary who are
under the age of 21 years may, in the discretion of the court, be sentenced to
the state reformatory
or to the penitentiary, as the best interest of the person and of the public
may require. Roy v. Tinsley,
142 Colo. 241, 350 P.2d 564 (1960).</T>
   <P></P>
   <T>The question of sentence, once there is a conviction, is left to the
discretion of the court; this
was clearly the intent of the general assembly. Bitner v. Tinsley, 151 Colo.
367, 378 P.2d 203 (1963).</T>
   <P></P>
   <T>The choice of place of confinement is within
the sound discretion of the court, just as is the length
of term of imprisonment. People v. Weihs, 187 Colo. 124,
529 P.2d 317 (1974).</T>
   <P></P>
   <T>
    <B>Court not bound by probation reports.</B> A probation officer's finding or
recommendation that a
defendant would benefit from probation does not require the trial court to
grant probation, or to
sentence defendant to an indeterminate term in the state reformatory. Bitner
v. Tinsley, 151 Colo.
367, 378 P.2d 203 (1963).</T>
   <P></P>
   <T>
    <B>And sentence stands unless discretion is abused.</B> It is the trial court,
having the opportunity
to examine a petitioner and the probation reports, who is best equipped to
determine where he should be
required to serve his sentence, and in the absence of a showing of abuse of
judicial discretion the sentence
must stand. Bitner v. Tinsley, 151 Colo. 367, 378 P.2d 203 (1963).</T>
   <P></P>
   <T>
    <B>This section read with statute fixing penalty for crime.</B> In considering
whether
a sentence is within the provisions of the statute fixing the penalty for the
commission
of a crime, this section which provides for commitment to the reformatory in
certain cases is
fully applicable and applies when the pertinent facts are present. Rivera v.
People, 128 Colo.
549, 265 P.2d 226 (1953); Stilley v. Tinsley, 153 Colo. 66, 385 P.2d 677
(1963).</T>
   <P></P>
   <T>
    <B>It refers to age of defendant at time of sentence</B> and not to the time of
the commission
of an offense. McKinney v. People, 138 Colo. 294, 332 P.2d 895 (1958).</T>
   <P></P>
   <T>
    <B>Application of this section is limited to those persons who are of the full
age of 18 (now 21)
years at the time of sentence.</B> Gallegos v. Tinsley, 139 Colo. 157, 337 P.2d
386 (1959).</T>
   <P></P>
   <T>The age of a defendant on the date of the commission of the crime is not
determinative of
the punishment to be imposed, but rather his age at the time of sentence is
controlling. Maes
v. Tinsley, 143 Colo. 405, 353 P.2d 586, cert. denied, 364 U.S. 923, 81
S. Ct. 292, 5 L. Ed. 2d 264 (1960).</T>
   <P></P>
   <T>
    <B>It does not apply to class one felonies.</B> This section has at all times
contained the
exception pertaining to persons convicted of crimes involving the penalty of
imprisonment for
life (now class one felonies). Thompson v. People, 136 Colo. 336, 316 P.2d
1043 (1957);
Maes v. Tinsley, 143 Colo. 405, 353
P.2d 586, cert. denied, 364 U.S. 923, 81 S. Ct. 292, 5 L. Ed. 2d 264 (1960).</T>
   <P></P>
   <T>
    <B>Where court is bound by jury sentencing.</B> Where jury found defendant
guilty of
first-degree murder and fixed penalty at imprisonment for life, court had no
discretion but
to give sentence accordingly. People ex rel. Dunbar v. District Court, 180
Colo. 107,
502 P.2d 420 (1972).</T>
   <P></P>
   <T>
    <B>Absent statute, minor punishable as adult.</B> Unless there is a statute
which makes mandatory
a sentence, in the case of a minor, other than that applicable to adults, an
offense committed
by a minor is punishable in the same manner as though committed by an adult.
Gallegos v. Tinsley,
139 Colo. 157, 337 P.2d 386 (1959).</T>
   <P></P>
   <T>
    <B>Court may sentence juvenile as an adult.</B>
The district court has the authority to sentence a juvenile charged as an
adult to the department of corrections for the term of imprisonment authorized
for adults.
Rocha v. People, 713 P.2d 350 (Colo. 1986).</T>
   <P></P>
   <T>
    <B>The court's statutory authority to sentence a defendant</B> to the department of
corrections does not expressly include the authority to dictate the conditions of
confinement. The management, supervision, and control of department facilities are
exclusively vested in its director. People v. Harris, 934 P.2d 882 (Colo. App. 1997).</T>
   <P></P>
   <T>
    <B>Trial court lacks jurisdiction</B> to order that a juvenile, sentenced as
an adult, be placed in a therapeutic program within the department of
institutions (now human services). The executive director of the department
of corrections has the sole authority to determine where an offender serves his
or her sentence. White v. Adamek, 907 P.2d 735 (Colo. App. 1995).</T>
   <P></P>
   <T>
    <B>The legislative intent of this section is to give the executive director
of the department of corrections ultimate responsibility for placing of
inmates in particular facilities.</B> Thus, the court could recommend
sentencing to an out-of-state facility, but it could not order such placement.
People v. Brack, 821 P.2d 928 (Colo. App. 1991).</T>
   <P></P>
   <T>
    <B>A county court is bound by this section in the sentencing of minors.</B>
Latham v. People, 136 Colo. 252, 317 P.2d 894, 334 P.2d 437 (1957).</T>
   <P></P>
   <T>
    <B>Court may not disregard legislative sentencing mandates.</B>
A court is not free to disregard the legislative mandate of
§§ 16-11-201 and 16-11-308 and this section, even when it appears to
dictate a sentence
which the court considers inappropriate to a particular case. People ex
rel. Gallagher v. District Court, 632 P.2d 1009 (Colo. 1981).</T>
   <P></P>
   <T>
    <B>A sentence providing for incarceration in an institution other than that
provided by law is void</B> as beyond the jurisdiction of the sentencing court.
Stilley v. Tinsley, 153 Colo. 66, 385 P.2d 677 (1963).</T>
   <P></P>
   <T>
    <B>Habeas corpus is a proper remedy to afford relief from a void sentence,</B>
but not from an
erroneous sentence. Stilley v. Tinsley, 153 Colo. 66, 385 P.2d 677 (1963).</T>
   <P></P>
   <T>A judgment and sentence to the penitentiary for any term, when the law
requires a reformatory confinement, is a void judgment and habeas corpus is a
proper remedy to afford relief. Rivera v. People, 128 Colo. 549, 265 P.2d 226
(1953);
Barrett v. People, 136 Colo. 144, 315 P.2d 192 (1957);
Petsche v. Clingan, 273 F.2d 688 (10th Cir. 1960);
Stilley v. Tinsley, 153 Colo. 66, 385 P.2d 677 (1963).</T>
   <P></P>
   <T>
    <B>Sentence valid.</B> Where it is within the discretion of a trial court to
sentence a defendant to the
reformatory or to the penitentiary and the sentence is to the penitentiary, and within the
minimum
and
maximum term of years authorized, the sentence is valid. Bartell v. People,
137 Colo. 300, 324 P.2d 378 (1958).</T>
   <P></P>
   <T>
    <B>Penitentiary sentence was not abuse of discretion.</B> Where the sentence of
one convicted of a crime to the state reformatory or to the penitentiary rests
in the discretion of the trial court, a petition for a writ of habeas corpus is
properly denied where the record discloses that the petitioners, who were 18
years of age, had four previous convictions for various offenses and the
probation officer recommended sentences to the penitentiary rather than to the
state reformatory, and petitioners were so sentenced. Roy v. Tinsley, 142
Colo. 241, 350 P.2d 564 (1960).</T>
   <P></P>
   <T>
    <B>Reformatory sentence in county different from court is proper.</B>
Jurisdiction is conferred upon the court to impose the sentence in a
reformatory and although the reformatory may be in another county from that in
which the particular justice conducts proceedings, whatever authority is
essential to commitment therein is necessarily implied. Aranda v. Patterson,
146 Colo. 424, 361 P.2d 782 (1961).</T>

where the defendant was released on an appeal bond and, like an offender in community
corrections on non-residential status, she was able to carry on a wide range of activities
open to persons who have never been convicted of any crime, such as obtaining

  <T>(a)<M>Ensuring public safety and respecting the rights of victims are paramount
concerns of the citizens of Colorado;</M>
  </T>
  <P N="(1)(b)"></P>

examination of, and recommendations regarding, the criminal and juvenile justice
systems;</M>
  </T>
  <P N="(1)(c)"></P>

significant percentage of the state budget for incarceration of offenders;</M>
  </T>
  <P N="(1)(d)"></P>
  <T>(d)<M>The number of offenders projected to be sentenced in the future will require
that
an even greater percentage of the state budget be dedicated to incarceration;</M>
  </T>
  <P N="(1)(e)"></P>
  <T>(e)<M>The rate of recidivism is high, resulting in the return of many offenders to the
justice system with additional significant expense;</M>

  <P N="(1)(f)"></P>
  <T>(f)<M>It is in the interest of the people of the state of Colorado to maintain public

through the most cost-effective use of limited criminal justice resources;</M>

  <T>(g)<M>Many factors may contribute to an offender's criminal behavior, including
but not limited to substance abuse and substance use disorders, behavioral or mental
health disorders, poverty, child abuse, domestic violence, and educational deficiencies.
Factors contributing to criminal conduct and re-victimization are frequently not
addressed adequately within the justice system.</M>
  </T>
  <P N="(1)(h)"></P>
  <T>(h)<M>Appropriate intervention in a child's life through the juvenile justice system
or
prevention programs may limit or prevent future criminal conduct;</M>
  </T>
  <P N="(1)(i)"></P>
  <T>(i)<M>It is in the best interest of the public to engage in a comprehensive,
evidence-based analysis of the circumstances and characteristics of the offenders being
sentenced to the department of corrections, the alternatives to incarceration, the
effectiveness
of prevention programs, and the effectiveness of the criminal code and sentencing laws
in
securing public safety.</M>
  </T>
  <P N="(2)"></P>
  <T>(2)<M>Therefore, the general assembly declares that a commission comprised of
experts in criminal justice, corrections, mental and behavioral health, drug abuse, victims'

  </CATCH-LINE>
The general assembly hereby declares that substance abuse, specifically the
abuse of alcohol and controlled substances, is a major problem in the criminal
justice
system of the state of Colorado and in the entire nation. Substance abuse
is a significant factor in the commission of crimes and it is a significant
factor in impeding the rehabilitation of persons convicted of crimes
which results in an increased rate of recidivism. Therefore, the general
assembly hereby resolves to curtail the disastrous effects of substance
abuse in the criminal justice system by providing for consistency in
the response to substance abuse throughout the criminal justice system and
to improve and standardize substance abuse treatment for offenders at each
stage of the criminal justice system and to provide punitive
measures for offenders who refuse to cooperate with and respond to
substance abuse treatment while such offenders are involved with the
criminal justice system.</SECTION-TEXT>

  </CATCH-LINE>
(1)<M>The judicial department, the department of
corrections, the state board of parole, the division of criminal
justice of the department of public safety, and the department of
public health and environment shall cooperate to develop
and implement the following:</M>
  <P N="(1)(a)"></P>
  <T>(a)<M>A standardized procedure for the assessment of the use of controlled
substances by offenders, which procedure shall include the administration
of a chemical test of such offender for the presence of
controlled substances or alcohol, or such other test of the
offender for the presence of controlled substances or alcohol as deemed
appropriate by the supervising agency. The assessment procedure developed
pursuant to this paragraph (a) shall provide an evaluation of the extent of
an offender's abuse of substances, if any, and
recommend treatment which is appropriate to the needs of the particular
offender.</M>
  </T>
  <P N="(1)(b)"></P>
  <T>(b)<M>A system of programs for education and treatment of abuse of
substances which can be utilized by offenders who are placed on
probation, incarcerated with the department of corrections, placed on
parole, or placed in community corrections. The programs developed
pursuant to this paragraph (b) shall be as flexible as possible so that
such programs may be utilized by each particular offender to the extent
appropriate to that offender. The programs developed pursuant to this
paragraph (b) shall be structured in such a manner that the programs
provide a continuum of education and treatment programs for each offender as he
proceeds
through the criminal justice system and may include, but shall not be
limited to, attendance at self-help groups, group counseling,
individual counseling, outpatient treatment, inpatient treatment, day care,
or
treatment in a therapeutic community. Also, such programs shall be
developed in such a manner that, to the extent possible, the programs may
be accessed by all offenders in the criminal justice system. Any programs
developed pursuant to this paragraph (b) shall include a system of
periodic
or random chemical testing for the presence
of controlled substances or alcohol, or such other testing as provided in
paragraph (a) of this subsection (1). The frequency of such testing
shall
be that which is appropriate to the particular
offender in accordance with the offender's assessment performed pursuant to
paragraph (a) of this subsection (1).</M>
  </T>
  <P N="(1)(c)"></P>
  <T>(c)<M>A system of punitive sanctions for offenders who test positive for
the use of substances subsequent to the initial test
and after being placed in an education or treatment program. The sanctions
developed pursuant to this paragraph (c) should allow for appropriate
responses by the criminal justice system to each occurrence of a positive
test by an offender, each of which shall become a permanent part of the
offender's record.</M>

(1)<M>The general assembly finds that, to protect the public and to work toward the
elimination of sexual offenses, it is necessary to comprehensively evaluate, identify, treat,
manage, and monitor adult sex offenders who are subject to the supervision of the
criminal justice system and juveniles who have committed sexual offenses who are
subject to the supervision of the juvenile justice system.</M>
  <P N="(2)"></P>
  <T>(2)<M>Therefore, the general assembly declares that it is necessary to create a
program that establishes evidence-based standards for the evaluation, identification,
treatment, management, and monitoring of adult sex offenders and juveniles who have
committed sexual offenses at each stage of the criminal or juvenile justice system to
prevent offenders from reoffending and enhance the protection of victims and potential
victims. The general assembly does not intend to imply that all offenders can or will

    <B>Even assuming that the department of corrections has authority to classify as a

    <B>The word "history" in the definition of "sex offender" can include the

engaged in soliciting for child prostitution, pandering of a child, procurement of a child
for
sexual exploitation, and inducement of child prostitution. The trial court therefore
appropriately sentenced the defendant to treatment under the provisions of this article
and
required the defendant to register as a sex offender pursuant to § 18-3-412.5.

   <B>Standards for identification and evaluation of adult sex offenders.</B>
(I)<M>The board shall develop, prescribe, and revise, as appropriate, a standard
procedure to evaluate and identify adult sex offenders, including adult sex offenders with
developmental disabilities. The procedures shall provide for an evaluation and
identification of the adult sex offender and recommend management, monitoring, and
treatment based upon existing research and shall incorporate the concepts of the
risk-need-responsivity or another evidence-based correctional model. There is currently
no way to ensure that adult sex offenders with the propensity to commit sexual offenses
will not reoffend. Because there are adult sex offenders who can learn to manage
unhealthy patterns and learn behaviors that can lessen their risk to society in the course of
ongoing treatment, management, and monitoring, the board shall develop a procedure for
evaluating and identifying, on a case-by-case basis, reliably lower-risk sex offenders
whose risk to sexually reoffend may not be further reduced by participation in treatment
as described in paragraph (b) of this subsection (4). The board shall develop and
implement methods of intervention for adult sex offenders, which methods have as a
priority the physical and psychological safety of victims and potential victims and which
are appropriate to the assessed needs of the particular offender, so long as there is no
reduction in the safety of victims and potential victims.</M>

  </T>
  <P N="(4)(b)(I)"></P>
  <T>(b)<M></M>
   <B>Guidelines and standards for treatment of adult offenders.</B>
(I)<M>The
board shall develop, implement, and revise, as appropriate, guidelines and standards to
treat adult sex offenders, including adult sex offenders with intellectual and
developmental disabilities, incorporating in the guidelines and standards the concepts of
the risk-need-responsivity or another evidence-based correctional model, which
guidelines and standards can be used in the treatment of offenders who are placed on
probation, incarcerated with the department of corrections, placed on parole, or placed in
community corrections. Programs implemented pursuant to the guidelines and standards
developed pursuant to this subsection (4)(b) must be as flexible as possible so that the
programs may be accessed by each adult sex offender to prevent the offender from
harming victims and potential victims. Programs must include a continuing monitoring
process and a continuum of treatment options available to an adult sex offender as he or
she proceeds through the criminal justice system. Treatment options must be determined
by a current risk assessment and evaluation and may include, but need not be limited to,
group counseling, individual counseling, family counseling, outpatient treatment,
inpatient treatment, shared living arrangements, or treatment in a therapeutic community.
Programs implemented pursuant to the guidelines and standards developed pursuant to
this subsection (4)(b) must, to the extent possible, be accessible to all adult sex offenders
in the criminal justice system, including those offenders with behavioral, mental health,
and co-occurring disorders. The procedures for evaluation, identification, treatment, and
monitoring developed pursuant to this subsection (4) must be implemented only to the
extent that money is available in the sex offender surcharge fund created in section
18-21-103 (3).</M>
  </T>

surcharge fund created pursuant to section 18-21-103 (3), C.R.S., among the judicial
department, the department of corrections, the division of criminal justice in the
department of public safety, and the department of human services. In addition, the
board
shall coordinate the expenditure of moneys from the sex offender surcharge fund with
any
moneys expended by any of the departments described in this paragraph (c) to identify,
evaluate, and treat adult sex offenders and juveniles who have committed sexual
offenses.
The general assembly may appropriate moneys from the sex offender surcharge fund in
accordance with the plan.</T>

  <T>(d)<M></M>
   <B>Risk assessment screening instrument.</B> The board shall consult on,
approve, and revise, as necessary, the risk assessment screening instrument developed by
the division of criminal justice to assist the sentencing court in determining the likelihood
that an adult sex offender will commit one or more of the offenses specified in section
18-3-414.5 (1)(a)(II), C.R.S., under the circumstances described in section 18-3-414.5
(1)(a)(III), C.R.S. In carrying out this duty, the board shall consider research on adult
sex offender risk assessment and shall consider as one element the risk posed by an adult
sex offender who suffers from psychopathy or a personality disorder that makes the
person more likely to engage in sexually violent predatory offenses. If a defendant is
found to be a sexually violent predator, the defendant shall be required to register
pursuant to article 22 of this title and shall be subject to community notification pursuant
to part 9 of article 13 of this title.</T>
  <P N="(4)(e)(I)"></P>
  <T>(e)<M></M>
   <B>Evaluation of policies and procedures - report.</B> (I)<M>The board
shall
research, either through direct evaluation or through a review of relevant research articles
and sex offender treatment empirical data, and analyze, through a comprehensive review
of evidence-based practices, the effectiveness of the evaluation, identification, and
treatment policies and procedures for adult sex offenders developed pursuant to this
article. This research shall specifically include, but need not be limited to, reviewing and
researching reoffense and factors that contribute to reoffense for sex offenders as defined
in this article, the effective use of cognitive behavioral therapy to prevent reoffense, the
use of polygraphs in treatment, and the containment model for adult sex offender
management and treatment and its effective application. The board shall revise the
guidelines and standards for evaluation, identification, and treatment, as appropriate,
based upon the results of the board's research and analysis. The board shall also develop
and prescribe a system to implement the guidelines and standards developed pursuant to
paragraph (b) of this subsection (4).</M>

   <B>Criteria for measuring progress in treatment.</B> (I)<M>Pursuant to
section
18-1.3-1009, C.R.S., concerning the criteria for release from incarceration, reduction in
supervision, and discharge for certain adult sex offenders, the board, in collaboration
with
the department of corrections, the judicial department, and the state board of parole, shall
develop and revise, as appropriate, criteria for measuring an adult sex offender's progress
in treatment. The criteria shall assist the court and the state board of parole in
determining whether an adult sex offender may appropriately be released from
incarceration pursuant to section 18-1.3-1006 (1), C.R.S., or whether the adult sex
offender's level of supervision may be reduced pursuant to section 18-1.3-1006 (2)(a) or
18-1.3-1008, C.R.S., or whether the adult sex offender may appropriately be discharged
from probation or parole pursuant to section 18-1.3-1006 or 18-1.3-1008, C.R.S. At a
minimum, the criteria shall be designed to assist the court and the state board of parole in
determining whether the adult sex offender could be appropriately supervised in the
community if he or she were released from incarceration, released to a reduced level of
supervision, or discharged from probation or parole. The criteria shall not limit the
decision-making authority of the court or the state board of parole.</M>
  </T>
  <P N="(4)(f)(II)"></P>
  <T>(II)<M>The board, in collaboration with the department of corrections, the judicial
department, and the state board of parole, shall establish standards for community entities
that provide supervision and treatment specifically designed for adult sex offenders who
have developmental disabilities. At a minimum, the standards shall determine whether
an
entity would provide adequate support and supervision to minimize any threat that the
adult sex offender may pose to the community.</M>
  </T>
  <P N="(4)(g)"></P>
  <T>(g)<M></M>
   <B>Living arrangements for adult sex offenders - recommendations.</B>
The
board shall research, analyze, and make recommendations that reflect best practices for
living arrangements for and the location of adult sex offenders within the community,
including but not limited to shared living arrangements. At a minimum, the board shall
consider the safety issues raised by the location of sex offender residences, especially in
proximity to public or private schools and child care facilities, and public notification of
the location of sex offender residences. The board shall adopt and revise as appropriate
such guidelines as it may deem appropriate regarding the living arrangements and
location of adult sex offenders and adult sex offender housing. The board shall
accomplish the requirements specified in this paragraph (g) within existing
appropriations.</T>
  <P N="(4)(h)(I)"></P>
  <T>(h)<M></M>
   <B>Data collection from treatment providers.</B> (I)<M>If the department
of
public safety acquires sufficient funding, the board may request that individuals or
entities providing sex-offender-specific evaluation, treatment, or polygraph services that
conform with standards developed by the board pursuant to paragraph (b) of this
subsection (4) submit to the board data and information as determined by the board at the
time that funding becomes available. This data and information may be used by the board
to evaluate the effectiveness of the guidelines and standards developed pursuant to this
article; to evaluate the effectiveness of individuals or entities providing
sex-offender-specific evaluation, treatment, or polygraph services; or for any other
purposes consistent with the provisions of this article.</M>
  </T>
  <P N="(4)(h)(II)"></P>
  <T>(II)<M>The board shall develop a data collection plan, including associated costs, in
consultation with the research and evaluation professionals on the board and within the
department of public safety. The board shall report on the data collection plan to the
judiciary committees of the general assembly, or any successor committees, as part of its
annual report presented pursuant to section 16-11.7-109 (2) in January 2017. By July 1,
2017, the board shall revise the guidelines and standards for approved providers
developed pursuant to paragraphs (b) and (j) of this subsection (4) to require evaluators,
treatment providers, and polygraph examiners to collect data pursuant to the data
collection plan. If the board determines that it will be unable to complete the revision of
the guidelines and standards by July 1, 2017, the board shall report to the judiciary
committees of the general assembly, or any successor committees, a projected completion
date as part of its annual report presented pursuant to section 16-11.7-109 (2) in January
2017.</M>

   <B>Standards for identification and evaluation of juvenile offenders.</B>
The
board shall develop, prescribe, and revise, as appropriate, a standard procedure to
evaluate and identify juveniles who have committed sexual offenses, including juveniles
with developmental disabilities. The procedure shall provide for an evaluation and
identification of the juvenile offender and recommend behavior management,
monitoring, treatment, and compliance and shall incorporate the concepts of the
risk-need-responsivity or another evidence-based correctional model based upon the
knowledge that all unlawful sexual behavior poses a risk to the community and that
certain juveniles may have the capacity to change their behavior with appropriate
intervention and treatment. The board shall develop and implement methods of
intervention for juveniles who have committed sexual offenses, which methods have as a
priority the physical and psychological safety of victims and potential victims and that
are appropriate to the needs of the particular juvenile offender, so long as there is no
reduction in the safety of victims and potential victims.</T>

and developmental disabilities, incorporating in the guidelines and standards the
concepts of the risk-need-responsivity or another evidence-based correctional model,
which guidelines and standards may be used for juvenile offenders who are placed on
probation, committed to the department of human services, placed on parole, or placed in
out-of-home placement. Programs implemented pursuant to the guidelines and standards
developed pursuant to this subsection (4)(j) must be as flexible as possible so that the

felony and many misdemeanor sex offenders from living within its boundaries, but draws
no distinctions based upon the nature of the offense, the treatment the offender has
received, the risk that he or she will reoffend against children, and the evaluation and

whether a prisoner's freedom has been restrained in a manner that imposes atypical and
significant hardship, the court must carefully examine the conditions of the prisoner's
confinement, including the duration and degree of prisoner's restrictions as compared

    <B>Requiring a sex offender as a condition of his supervised release to successfully
complete a sex offender treatment program, including a sexual history polygraph</B>
requiring him to answer questions regarding whether he had committed sexual crimes for
which he was never charged violated his fifth amendment privilege against
self-incrimination. United States v. Von Behren, 822 F.3d 1139 (10th Cir. 2016).</T>
   <P></P>
   <T>Because the answers to the mandatory questions could focus an investigation on the
offender and also because his confession to the past crimes could potentially be used
against him at trial, the offender faces at least some authentic danger of
self-incrimination by answering some of the questions in the polygraph. United States v.
Von Behren, 822 F.3d 1139 (10th Cir. 2016).</T>
   <P></P>
   <T>The government's threat to revoke an offender's supervised release for his failure to
answer potentially incriminating questions rises to the level of unconstitutional
compulsion. A threat to revoke one's probation for properly invoking one's fifth
amendment privilege is the type of compulsion the state may not constitutionally impose.

recommend behavior management, monitoring, and treatment and include a procedure
for when a treatment provider recommends that an offender does not need treatment. The
board shall develop and implement methods of intervention for domestic violence
offenders that have as a priority the physical and psychological safety of victims and

committed a crime, the underlying factual basis of which has been found by the court on
the record to include an act of domestic violence, and who are placed on probation,
placed on parole, or placed in community corrections or who receive a deferred judgment
and sentence. The programs developed pursuant to this subparagraph (II) shall be as
flexible as possible so that the programs may be utilized by each offender to prevent the
offender from harming victims and potential victims. The programs shall be structured
in
such a manner that they provide a continuing monitoring process as well as a continuum
of treatment programs for each offender as that offender proceeds through the criminal
justice system and may include, but shall not be limited to, group counseling, individual
counseling, outpatient treatment, or treatment in a therapeutic community. Also, the
programs shall be developed in such a manner that, to the extent possible, the programs
may be accessed by all offenders in the criminal justice system.</M>

in compliance with the standards adopted pursuant to subsections (4)(a)(I) and (4)(a)(II)
of this section. The application and review process must consist of the following three
parts:</M>
  </T>
  <P N="(4)(a)(III)(A)"></P>
  <T>(A)<M>The board shall develop separate application and review processes for
standards that apply to the criminal justice component, such as criminal history record
checks, for individual treatment providers and treatment programs. Applications for the
criminal justice components, including fingerprints, must be submitted to the board. The
board shall forward the fingerprints to the Colorado bureau of investigation for use in
conducting a state criminal history record check and for transmittal to the federal bureau
of investigation for a national criminal history record check. The information obtained
from the state and national criminal history record check may be used by the board to

application and review process.</M>

review process, the board shall publish at least annually a list of approved providers. The
board shall forward the list to the office of the state court administrator, the department
of public safety, the department of human services, and the department of corrections.
The board shall update the list of approved providers and forward as changes are made.</M>
  </T>
  <P N="(4)(a)(III)(D)"></P>
  <T>(D)<M>Notwithstanding any action taken by the department of regulatory agencies
against a treatment provider, the board may take action against a treatment provider
including, but not limited to, removing a treatment provider from the approved provider
list. The board may determine the requirements for a treatment provider's name to be
placed on the list after his or her name has been removed from the list pursuant to this
subsection (4)(a)(III).</M>
  </T>
  <P N="(4)(a)(III.5)"></P>
  <T>(III.5)<M>Develop a treatment provider renewal process for the continued
placement of a person on the approved provider list published pursuant to
sub-subparagraph (C) of subparagraph (III) of this paragraph (a);</M>

  <T>(IV)<M>Research and analyze the effectiveness of the treatment evaluation and
treatment procedures and programs developed pursuant to this article. The board shall
also develop and prescribe a system for implementation of the guidelines and standards
developed pursuant to subparagraphs (I) and (II) of this paragraph (a) and for tracking
offenders who have been evaluated and treated pursuant to this article. In addition, the
board shall develop a system for monitoring offender behaviors and offender adherence
to
prescribed behavioral changes. The results of such tracking and behavioral monitoring
shall be a part of any analysis made pursuant to this subparagraph (IV).</M>
  </T>
  <P N="(4)(b)"></P>
  <T>(b)<M>After the guidelines and standards required pursuant to subsections
(4)(a)(I) and (4)(a)(II) of this section are adopted, the board shall refer any complaints or
grievances against domestic violence offender treatment providers to the department of
regulatory agencies for resolution. Notwithstanding any other law or administrative rule,
the resolution of any complaint or grievance referred by the board pursuant to this
subsection (4)(b) shall be based on such standards. All complaints and grievances shall
be
reviewed by the appropriate board pursuant to part 2 of article 245 of title 12, whose
decision shall be based on accepted community standards as described in subsections
(4)(a)(I) and (4)(a)(II) of this section and the prohibited activities as defined in section
12-245-224 (1). The department of regulatory agencies shall provide notice of the
disciplinary action to the board.</M>

The general assembly finds and declares that, based upon
the findings and recommendations of the 1999 interim committee to study the treatment
of persons with mental illness in the Colorado criminal justice system, detecting
behavioral or mental health disorders in persons in the criminal justice system is a
difficult process with no current statewide standards or requirements. The lack of a
standardized screening process to detect persons with behavioral or mental health
disorders in the criminal justice system is a significant impediment to consistent
identification, diagnosis, treatment, and rehabilitation of all offenders with behavioral or
mental health disorders, ultimately resulting in an increased rate of recidivism. Therefore,
the general assembly resolves to create a standardized screening process to be utilized at
each stage of the criminal justice system to identify persons with behavioral or mental
health disorders.</SECTION-TEXT>

  <P N="(1)(a)"></P>
  <T>(a)<M>Colorado's citizens who are living with mental health and substance use
disorders are overrepresented in the criminal justice system, and they are at a
significantly greater risk of incurring criminal justice involvement, longer terms of

general public;</M>
  </T>
  <P N="(1)(b)"></P>
  <T>(b)<M>Colorado must make a commitment to ensure that all individuals within the
criminal justice system are treated fairly and humanely, regardless of their behavioral

  <P N="(2)"></P>
  <T>(2)<M>The general assembly further finds that:</M>
  </T>
  <P N="(2)(a)"></P>

  <T>(3)<M>The general assembly therefore finds that it is critical to create a network of

court liaison program must provide a method for collaboration and consultation among
behavioral health providers, district attorneys, and defense attorneys about available
community-based behavioral health services and supports, competency evaluations,
restoration to competency services, and other relevant decisions and issues facing
individuals with mental health or co-occurring behavioral health conditions who are

    <B>Annotator's note.</B> Since § 16-12-101 is similar to repealed
§ 39-7-27, CRS 53, and laws antecedent to CSA, C. 48, § 500, relevant
cases construing those provisions have been included in the annotations to this section.</T>
   <P></P>
   <T>
    <B>Common-law right to review recognized by statute.</B> In Colorado
the common-law right of the defendant to obtain appellate review of criminal
proceedings was given statutory recognition and standing as far back as 1861 by
the territorial legislature. Krutka v. Spinuzzi, 153 Colo. 115, 384 P.2d 928 (1963).</T>
   <P></P>
   <T>
    <B>A trial de novo conducted by the district court is not a review of the county
court judgment;</B> it is an entirely new proceeding. Bovard v. People, 99 P.3d 585
(Colo. 2004).</T>
   <P></P>
   <T>
    <B>Only in cases tried de novo by the district court will the district court judgment
be subject to direct appeal.</B> Justifiably, then, the defendant may seek direct appeal
when the district court enters its judgment from a de novo trial. Bovard v. People, 99
P.3d 585 (Colo. 2004).</T>
   <P></P>
   <T>
    <B>Certiorari review does not suffice as an appellate review from a final judgment
of the district court.</B> Bovard v. People, 99 P.3d 585 (Colo. 2004).</T>
   <P></P>
   <T>
    <B>Section gives one appeal as a matter of right.</B> Under this section,
one convicted of crime is entitled as a matter of right to one appeal, but where
such appeal is dismissed for want of prosecution, he is not entitled
as a matter of right to a second.
Caviness v. People, 27 Colo. 283, 60 P. 565 (1900).</T>
   <P></P>
   <T>
    <B>Nothing in this section prohibits a direct
appeal of a probation revocation order under C.A.R. 1.</B>
People v. Carr, 185 Colo. 293, 524 P.2d 301 (1974).</T>
   <P></P>
   <T>
    <B>Appellate review may not discriminate on account of poverty.</B> A
state is not required by the federal constitution to provide appellate courts or a
right to appellate review at all. But a state that does grant appellate review cannot
do so in a way that discriminates against some convicted defendants on account of their
poverty. In re Patterson, 136 Colo. 401, 317 P.2d 1041 (1957).</T>
   <P></P>
   <T>
    <B>Appeals in criminal cases are a matter of right.</B> In re Patterson, 136
Colo. 410, 317 P.2d 1041 (1957);
In re Griffin, 152 Colo. 347, 382 P.2d 202 (1963).</T>
   <P></P>
   <T>
    <B>Because this section creates a statutory right of appeal of a conviction, the
common law doctrine of abatement ab initio applies if defendant dies after filing the
appeal but before the appeal can be decided.</B> However, the order of restitution
entered against defendant at the time of conviction created a civil judgment and was not
subject to abatement but could be appealed by defendant's estate. People v. Daly, 313
P.3d 571 (Colo. App. 2011).</T>
   <P></P>
   <T>
    <B>When a defendant dies while his criminal conviction is pending on direct
appeal, the doctrine of abatement ab initio extinguishes a restitution order entered as part
of his sentence.</B> People v. Johnson, 2020 COA 124, -- P.3d -- (holding contrary to
People v. Daly annotated above).</T>
   <P></P>
   <T>
    <B>An indigent defendant is entitled to obtain a free
transcript when necessary to exercise the right of appeal.</B>
People v. Shearer, 181 Colo. 237, 508 P.2d 1249 (1973).</T>
   <P></P>
   <T>
    <B>Appeal without benefit of counsel is unconstitutional.</B> Where
the merits of the one and only appeal an indigent has as of right are decided without
benefit of counsel, an unconstitutional line has been drawn between rich and poor.
In re Griffin, 152 Colo. 347, 382 P.2d 202 (1963).</T>
   <P></P>
   <T>
    <B>The supreme court is authorized as a matter of procedure to fix
the time within which an appeal could issue.</B> Johnson v. People,
140 Colo. 256, 344 P.2d 181 (1959), cert. denied, 361 U.S. 943, 80 S. Ct. 409,
4 L. Ed. 2d 364 (1960).</T>
   <P></P>
   <T>
    <B>Statute as basis for jurisdiction.</B> See People v. Young, 139 Colo. 357, 339
P.2d
672 (1959).</T>
   <P></P>
   <T>
    <B>Waiver of right to appeal.</B> A defendant cannot waive the right to challenge
an illegal sentence because there cannot be a valid agreement to an illegal sentence.
Such a sentence cannot validly be imposed and renders the plea agreement with its
resulting guilty plea invalid. People v. Bottenfield, 159 P.3d 643 (Colo. App. 2006).</T>

convictions - legislative intent.</M>
  </CATCH-LINE>
(1)<M>The general assembly urges
the Colorado supreme court to adopt an expedited process to review class 1
felony convictions where the death penalty has been
imposed and any order by the district court granting or denying
postconviction relief in such cases. It is the general assembly's
intent that the Colorado supreme court give priority to cases in
which a sentence of death has been imposed over other cases before
the court, except to the extent of any conflict with the
requirement that the court give the highest priority to
enforcement actions brought in accordance with section 20 (1) of
article X of the state constitution.</M>
  <P N="(2)"></P>
  <T>(2)<M>In any direct appeal of any
class 1 felony case in which a conviction is entered and in which a sentence of
death is imposed prior to the date upon which the Colorado
supreme court adopts rules implementing the unitary system of
review established by part 2 of this article, all challenges to any such
conviction or sentence, with the exception of any newly discovered
evidence or any claim of ineffective assistance of counsel, shall be included
in the brief of the person challenging such conviction or sentence, as such
brief is defined by rule 28 of the Colorado appellate rules, at the time such
brief is filed with the supreme court of the state of Colorado. Any issue
which is not raised in the manner prescribed in this section shall be deemed
to be irrevocably waived by the person challenging such conviction or
sentence. The failure of such person to file a brief within any time limits
ordered by the supreme court of the state of Colorado shall constitute an
irrevocable waiver of all issues which could have been raised in such brief.</M>

prosecution.</M>
  </CATCH-LINE>
(1)<M>The prosecution may appeal any decision of a court in a criminal case upon any
question of law. Any order of a court that either dismisses one or more counts of a charging
document prior to trial or grants a new trial after the entry of a verdict or judgment shall
constitute a final order that shall be immediately appealable pursuant to this subsection (1).
If any act of the general assembly is adjudged inoperative or unconstitutional in any criminal
case, it is the duty of the district attorney of the judicial district in which the court making
such decision is situated to appeal on behalf of the people of the state of Colorado, unless
the same issue of constitutionality is already pending before a reviewing court in another
case. Nothing in this section shall authorize placing the defendant in jeopardy a second time
for the same offense. No docket fee shall be required of the people upon an appeal under
this section. The procedure to be followed in filing and prosecuting appeals under this
section shall be as provided by applicable rule of the supreme court of Colorado. However,
if a statute providing for the imposition of the death penalty is adjudged inoperative or
inapplicable for any reason, such adjudication shall constitute a final order that shall be
immediately appealable to the supreme court of Colorado, notwithstanding any statute or
court rule to the contrary.</M>
  <P N="(2)"></P>
  <T>(2)<M>The prosecution may file an interlocutory appeal in the supreme court from a
ruling of the trial court granting a motion made in advance of trial by the defendant for the
return of property and to suppress evidence or granting a motion to suppress an extrajudicial
confession or admission if the prosecution certifies to the judge who granted such motion and
to the supreme court that the appeal is not taken for the purposes of delay and the evidence
is a substantial part of the proof of the charge pending against the defendant. The
prosecution may also file an interlocutory appeal in the supreme court from a ruling of the
trial court granting a motion in limine pertaining to the matters described in this subsection
(2), or from a ruling on a motion made pursuant to section 18-1-202 (11), C.R.S., challenging
the place of trial or from a ruling on a motion to disqualify a district attorney pursuant to
section 20-1-107, C.R.S.</M>

§ 39-7-26, CRS 1963, § 39-7-27, CRS 53, CSA, C 48, § 500, relevant
cases construing those provisions have been included in the annotations

   <P></P>
   <T>
    <B>Appeal by people to review judgment of acquittal did not exist at common
law</B> or when the state constitution was adopted in 1876. Krutka v. Spinuzzi,
153 Colo. 115, 384 P.2d 928 (1963).</T>
   <P></P>
   <T>
    <B>Purpose of appeal.</B> Appeals are not allowed for the mere purpose
of delay, or to present purely abstract legal questions, however, important
or interesting, but to correct errors injuriously affecting the right of some
party to the litigation. Miller v. Reeder, 157 Colo. 134, 401 P.2d 604 (1965).</T>
   <P></P>
   <T>The purpose of appellate review is essentially twofold: to settle the
controversy, and to provide explanation of and to give
clarity to questions of law by means of published opinions. People
v. Kirkland, 174 Colo. 362, 483 P.2d 1349 (1971);
People v. May, 182 Colo. 29, 511 P.2d 22 (1973).</T>
   <P></P>
   <T>
    <B>An appeal does not lie at the instance of the state unless clearly
authorized by this section.</B> People v. Zobel, 54 Colo. 284, 130 P. 837 (1913).</T>
   <P></P>
   <T>
    <B>Prosecution may file direct appeal as to a question of law following the
dismissal of all charges without prejudice at the prosecution's request following trial
court's evidentiary ruling that rendered the prosecution unable to proceed to trial.</B>
The finality of judgment requirement of C.A.R. 1 was satisfied when all charges were
dismissed and the case was ended. People v. Gabriesheski, 262 P.3d 653 (Colo. 2011).</T>
   <P></P>
   <T>
    <B>The plain text of the statute allows the prosecution to appeal dismissal of a
count
when other counts remain against the defendant.</B> People v. Collins, 32 P.3d 636

   <P></P>
   <T>
    <B>The prosecution may appeal a dismissal of a count prior to trial even when the
appeal is not based on a question of law.</B> People v. Collins, 32 P.3d 636 (Colo.
App.
2001).</T>
   <P></P>
   <T>
    <B>As where there is a question to decide for future guidance of trial courts.</B>
Where,
on appeal in behalf of the state, there is no proper question to decide for guidance of trial
courts
in the future, the appeal will be dismissed. People v. Denver Athletic Club, 63
Colo. 189, 164 P. 1158 (1917).</T>
   <P></P>
   <T>
    <B>Or where a legislative act has been held invalid.</B> An appeal may be issued
on behalf of the people to review court judgments holding legislative acts inoperative
or unconstitutional. People v. Bristol, 92 Colo. 325, 20 P.2d 309 (1933).</T>
   <P></P>
   <T>
    <B>Or question of law.</B> This section permits appeals on behalf of the people
to review decisions of the trial court upon questions of law arising in any criminal case.
People
v. Spinuzzi, 149 Colo. 391, 369 P.2d 427 (1962).</T>
   <P></P>
   <T>The people are limited on appeal to questions of law. People v. Ware, 187 Colo. 28,
528 P.2d 224 (1974).</T>
   <P></P>
   <T>Because subsection (1) authorizes the people to appeal any decision of the trial court
in a criminal case upon any question of law, C.A.R. 4(b)(2) requires an appellate court to
issue a written decision. People v. Wilburn, 2013 COA 135, 343 P.3d 998.</T>
   <P></P>
   <T>Prosecution's appeal, which raises no questions of law, is improper
under this section. People v. Chmielewski, 187 Colo. 268,
529 P.2d 1337 (1975).</T>
   <P></P>
   <T>
    <B>Or where complaint dismissed for lack of indictment.</B> Under this section
an
appeal will lie on behalf of the people to review a judgment of a justice dismissing
a complaint charging defendants with commission of a misdemeanor on the
ground that the prosecution was not instituted by indictment or information. People
v. Read, 132 Colo. 390, 288 P.2d 347 (1955).</T>
   <P></P>
   <T>
    <B>An order granting a new trial is a final order pursuant to this section, therefore,
prosecution must file its appeal within 45 days of the order.</B> People v. Curren, 228
P.3d 253 (Colo. App. 2009).</T>
   <P></P>
   <T>
    <B>Appropriateness of exclusion of witnesses a question of law.</B>
Whether the sanction imposed by the trial court -- exclusion of the
witnesses -- for
failure to comply with Crim. P. 16 (pt.II)(c), was appropriate under
the facts and circumstances of this case matter within the sound discretion
of the trial court, and an appropriate question of law under this section.
People v. Lyle, 200 Colo. 236, 613 P.2d 896 (1980).</T>
   <P></P>
   <T>
    <B>Trial court's interpretation of phrase in statute under which defendant was
charged is a question of law reviewable under this section.</B> People v. Miller, 97
P.3d 171 (Colo. App. 2003).</T>
   <P></P>
   <T>
    <B>Appropriateness and validity of technically defective notice of appeal</B>
is a question of law. People v. Bost, 770 P.2d 1209 (Colo. 1989).</T>
   <P></P>
   <T>
    <B>The prosecution can appeal a court's ruling on a defendant's Crim. P. 35 motion
challenging a sentence.</B> People v. Hunsaker, 2013 COA 5, 411 P.3d 36, aff'd, 2015
CO 46, 351 P.3d 388.</T>
   <P></P>
   <T>
    <B>The prosecution can appeal the court's imposed sentence when the basis for the
challenge is that the court applied the wrong sentencing range.</B> The prosecution can
appeal questions of law, and the statutory interpretation of the correct sentencing range is
a question of law. Hunsaker v. People, 2015 CO 46, 351 P.3d 388.</T>
   <P></P>
   <T>
    <B>Suppression of evidence is a question of law;</B> therefore the prosecution
may pursue an interlocutory appeal when a motion to suppress evidence is
granted. People v. Lewis, 813 P.2d 813 (Colo. App. 1991).</T>
   <P></P>
   <T>
    <B>Suppression of a confession given in the absence of a Miranda advisement was
warranted</B> where a defendant was vigorously chased, threatened at gunpoint,
sprayed
with mace, and ultimately subdued and handcuffed, because, despite the arresting
officers'
belief that they did not have probable cause to arrest the defendant, it would appear to a
reasonable person that the defendant's freedom of action or movement had been curtailed
to a degree associated with a formal arrest in terms of both severity and duration. People
v.
Mangum, 48 P.3d 568 (Colo. 2002).</T>
   <P></P>
   <T>
    <B>Suppression of incriminating statements warranted when defendant was subject
to interrogation by police officers before being advised of Miranda rights.</B> A
routine encounter turned into a custodial situation, as defendant was physically
surrounded by officers, was not free to go during questioning, and had "objective reasons
to believe that he was under arrest"; such circumstances constituted custody. People v.
Null, 233 P.3d 670 (Colo. 2010).</T>
   <P></P>
   <T>
    <B>Suppression of involuntary blood alcohol test results in a vehicular homicide
prosecution was erroneous because probable cause to administer the test existed</B>
when
eyewitnesses saw the defendant's car veer into oncoming traffic, no other cause for the
accident was apparent, and police officers found beer bottles and smelled alcohol in the
defendant's car. People v. Schall, 59 P.3d 848 (Colo. 2002).</T>
   <P></P>
   <T>
    <B>Only three circumstances for interlocutory appeal of a suppression order.</B>
Review is proper where evidence was suppressed due to: (1) An unlawful search and
seizure; (2) an involuntary confession or admission; or (3) an improperly ordered or
insufficiently supported, nontestimonial identification. People v. Braunthal, 31 P.3d 167
(Colo. 2001).</T>
   <P></P>
   <T>
    <B>Review pursuant to subsection (1) not appropriate</B> where argument in
essence challenges trial court's assessment of the evidence and does not
properly pose a question of law. People v. Fagerholm, 768 P.2d 689 (Colo. 1989).</T>
   <P></P>
   <T>
    <B>No proper jurisdiction to hear an appeal</B> when appeal involves an
evidentiary issue that implicates factual as well as legal issues.
People v. Martinez, 22 P.3d 915 (Colo. 2001).</T>
   <P></P>
   <T>The prosecution could not appeal the validity of an initial search because it was not
challenging the ruling based on a question of law. The prosecution's arguments included
factual issues related to the question of good faith. People v. George, 2017 COA 75, --
P.3d --.</T>
   <P></P>
   <T>
    <B>Court of appeals has jurisdiction to decide if trial court erred in
granting new trial under a postconviction relief motion</B> when issues in
motion
were brought pursuant to the "other remedies" portion of Crim. P. 35.
People v. Naranjo, 821 P.2d 836 (Colo. App. 1991).</T>
   <P></P>
   <T>
    <B>Court of appeals had appellate jurisdiction because trial court ultimately
dismissed the charges against defendant, which resulted in a final judgment.</B>
Regardless of whether the order declining to revoke defendant's deferred judgment was
immediately appealable, the finality requirement was met when the trial court dismissed
all of the charges. People v. Wilburn, 2013 COA 135, 343 P.3d 998.</T>
   <P></P>
   <T>
    <B>Trial court's finding in the preliminary hearing that
a killing was completely independent of a burglary</B>
was not binding on the appellate court.

   <P></P>
   <T>
    <B>Dismissal of prosecution based solely on reviewing content of document
was matter of law and therefore reviewable.</B> People v. Marston, 772 P.2d
615 (Colo. 1989).</T>
   <P></P>
   <T>
    <B>A denial of the prosecution's request for a presentence investigation report,
when
such a report is mandated by statute, clearly presents a question of law appealable under
this
section.</B> People v. Gretz, 973 P.2d 110 (Colo. App. 1998).</T>
   <P></P>
   <T>
    <B>Legal significance of delays in defendant's trial appealable matter.</B>
Where the trial court ruled that the delays in defendant's trial were at the
request and for the benefit of the defendant, the facts are undisputed, and the
only question is their legal significance, which is an appealable matter.
People v. Reliford, 186 Colo. 6,
525 P.2d 467 (1974).</T>
   <P></P>
   <T>
    <B>But questions of fact cannot be the subject of appeal</B> proceedings by
which the people seek disapproval of an action of the trial court. People
v. Ledesma, 171 Colo. 407, 468 P.2d 27 (1970).</T>
   <P></P>
   <T>Where determination that delays in
bringing defendant to trial involved resolutions of fact questions, the
district
attorney could not appeal such determinations. People v. Murphy, 183 Colo.
106, 515 P.2d 107 (1973).</T>
   <P></P>
   <T>C.A.R. 4(b) and this section give the district attorney
the right to appeal a judgment of a trial court in a criminal case upon any
question of law. However, such an appeal, involving sufficiency of the
evidence,
is seldom productive of any precedential value. The district attorney's time
and efforts can be better utilized than prosecuting appeals such as this.
Appeals by district attorneys should be avoided in cases which do not involve
egregious error by the trial court. People v. Samora, 188 Colo. 74,
532 P.2d 946 (1975).</T>
   <P></P>
   <T>
    <B>Subsection (1) does not permit interlocutory appeals in all cases where a
trial court declares a statute unconstitutional.</B> Where ruling that statute
was unconstitutional was not analogous to a final judgment but instead
represented one step toward the resolution of the defendant's Crim. P. 35 (c)
motion, and where immediate appellate review was not necessary, appeal was
dismissed for lack of appellate jurisdiction. People v. Romero, 801 P.2d
1192 (Colo. 1990).</T>
   <P></P>
   <T>
    <B>Nor will sufficiency of evidence be reviewed.</B> The accused being
acquitted,
the court will not entertain an appeal on behalf of the people merely
to determine the sufficiency of the evidence to warrant a conviction, where it
is improbable that a similar state of facts will again be presented, or where
a consideration of the testimony, and any declarations upon it,
will neither establish any principle of law nor be a guide in subsequent
prosecutions. People v. Kippy, 64 Colo. 597, 173 P. 395 (1918), overruled insofar as
inconsistent, People v. Kirkland, 174 Colo. 362, 483 P.2d 1349 (1971).</T>
   <P></P>
   <T>If the question of the sufficiency of the evidence as a whole is not
reviewable on an appeal prosecuted by the people, certainly the question of the
sufficiency
of that evidence as to any particular element of a crime such as the venue, the identity
of the defendant, or the corpus delicti, where there is nothing in the
testimony to make it specially applicable to other cases which may
follow, is not so reviewable. People v. Archer, 173 Colo. 299, 477 P.2d 791 (1970),
overruled insofar as inconsistent, People v. Kirkland, 174 Colo. 362, 483 P.2d 1349
(1971).</T>
   <P></P>
   <T>Appeals by prosecution where the sole issue is the sufficiency of the
evidence to sustain a conviction are not favored.
People v. Thompson, 748 P.2d 793 (Colo. 1988).</T>
   <P></P>
   <T>
    <B>The state may appeal a grant of a new trial.</B> People v. Smith, 921
P.2d 80 (Colo. App. 1996).</T>
   <P></P>
   <T>
    <B>Appellate review precluded</B> by the failure of the people to object at
the sentencing hearing to the imposition of a sentence within the
presumptive range when the defendant was convicted of possession of contraband while
in a correctional institution, or to request the trial court, pursuant to Crim. P. 35(a),
to correct the sentence. People v. Gallegos, 764 P.2d 76 (Colo. 1988).</T>
   <P></P>
   <T>
    <B>Acquittal on motion involving sufficiency is question of law.</B> The
issue of sufficiency of the evidence as postured where the trial court has
granted the defendant's motion for judgment of acquittal involves a question of law, and
as
such,
the district attorney is given authority to appeal. People v. Kirkland,
174 Colo. 362, 483 P.2d 1349 (1971).</T>
   <P></P>
   <T>
    <B>The final judgment for purposes of appeal</B> was entered
when trial court reversed its previous order imposing costs
on the defendant, and therefore state's appeal taken more than
30 days after sentencing was proper.
People v. Fisher, 189 Colo. 297, 539 P.2d 1258 (1975).</T>
   <P></P>
   <T>
    <B>For purposes of appeal, a final judgment must include the sentence.</B>
Therefore, after the sentence was vacated on appeal, an order withdrawing plea of
guilty was not a final judgment. Ellsworth v. People, 987 P.2d 264 (Colo. 1999).</T>
   <P></P>
   <T>
    <B>Prosecutor's appeal pursuant to this section is subject to the final judgment
requirement of C.A.R. 1.</B> People v. Guatney, 214 P.3d 1049 (Colo. 2009).</T>
   <P></P>
   <T>
    <B>Court order granting defendant's motion seeking the return of marijuana and
marijuana plants pursuant to art. XVIII, § 14 (2)(e), of the state constitution is a
final
judgment subject to appeal under this section.</B> People v. Crouse, 2013 COA 174,
412
P.3d 599, rev'd on other grounds, 2017 CO 5, 388 P.3d 39.</T>
   <P></P>
   <T>
    <B>An order declining to revoke probation is not a final judgment within meaning
of
C.A.R. 1,</B> thus the court of appeals lacked jurisdiction to entertain the appeal.
People v. Guatney, 214 P.3d 1049 (Colo. 2009).</T>
   <P></P>
   <T>
    <B>Interlocutory appeals permitted.</B> This section contains no language
which would limit the people's right to appeal solely to final judgments
of the trial court and, therefore, it permits interlocutory appeals. People
v. Traubert, 199 Colo. 322, 608 P.2d 342 (1980).</T>
   <P></P>
   <T>
    <B>Generally, interlocutory appeals authorized by statute are permissive rather than
mandatory,</B> and failure to pursue an immediate appeal does not preclude appeal of
the
issue when it merges into the final judgment. People v. Richardson, 58 P.3d 1039 (Colo.
App. 2002).</T>
   <P></P>
   <T>People's appeal filed within 45 days after defendant's sentencing was timely. People
v.
Richardson, 58 P.3d 1039 (Colo. App. 2002).</T>
   <P></P>
   <T>
    <B>An appeal that is classified as challenging a final order under subsection (1) for
purposes of appellate jurisdiction is not necessarily precluded from being
interlocutory</B> in nature so as to toll the speedy trial period under § 18-1-405
(6)(b). People v. Curren, 2014 COA 59M, 348 P.3d 467.</T>
   <P></P>
   <T>Prosecution's appeal from a new trial order must be characterized as interlocutory in
nature, so as to toll the speedy trial period under § 18-1-405 (6)(b), so long as the
appeal is taken in good faith, is filed before the defendant is convicted, and is necessarily
disruptive of the course of proceeding to a final resolution. People v. Gallegos, 946 P.2d
946 (Colo. 1997); People v. Curren, 2014 COA 59M, 348 P.3d 467.</T>
   <P></P>
   <T>
    <B>In order to toll the time for filing an interlocutory appeal, a motion to reconsider
a
trial court order of suppression must be filed within ten days of the date of the order of
suppression.</B> People v. Powers, 47 P.3d 686 (Colo. 2002).</T>
   <P></P>
   <T>
    <B>Only mechanism for review of district court's determination on appeal
from county court is by certiorari</B> to the supreme court as specified in
§ 13-6-310 (4). People v. Gonzales, 198 Colo. 546, 603 P.2d 139 (1979);
People v. Luna, 648 P.2d 624 (Colo. 1982).</T>
   <P></P>
   <T>
    <B>Only parties aggrieved may appeal.</B> The word aggrieved refers to a
substantial
grievance, the denial to the party of some claim of right, either of property
or of person, or the imposition upon him of some burden or obligation. Miller v. Reeder,
157 Colo. 134, 401 P.2d 604 (1965).</T>
   <P></P>
   <T>Only a party to the original proceeding may sue out an appeal. Where
the district attorney was not a party to the proceedings below, the parties being the people
of the state of Colorado versus Reeder, and is not a party aggrieved, he cannot be an
appellant in the supreme court. Miller v. Reeder, 157 Colo. 134, 401 P.2d 604 (1965).</T>
   <P></P>
   <T>
    <B>Error asserted by state must be prejudicial.</B> Under this section the
district attorney is authorized to raise by appeal certain questions, but that right
must be predicated upon the theory that the errors committed were prejudicial
to the people. People v. Wolff, 111 Colo. 46, 137 P.2d 693 (1943).</T>
   <P></P>
   <T>Although the district attorney is entitled to the judgment of the
supreme court on questions important to the prosecution of similar cases in the
future, it is essential that material errors, prejudicial to the state in the
particular case and covered by the statement of errors, be disclosed by the record.
People v. Hill, 116 Colo. 436, 181 P.2d 360 (1947).</T>
   <P></P>
   <T>
    <B>Erroneous rulings should be enumerated in opening brief.</B> When
the people appeal under this section upon a question of law following
an acquittal, they should enumerate in their opening brief the erroneous rulings of
which complaint is made. The supreme court will direct its attention
only to such issues so mentioned, unless manifest error appears.
People v. Martin, 192 Colo. 491, 561 P.2d 776 (1977).</T>
   <P></P>
   <T>
    <B>Trial court's findings of fact are entitled to deference</B> by a reviewing court,
but when the absence of factual findings regarding key contested issues hinders appellate
review, or when unresolved evidentiary conflicts exist with regard to material facts, case
must be remanded to the trial court for further fact-finding. People v. Brazzel, 18 P.3d
1285 (Colo. 2001).</T>
   <P></P>
   <T>
    <B>Review by state not available in delinquency proceeding.</B> Appellate courts
traditionally limit their jurisdiction to consideration
of actual controversies and refuse to give opinions on moot questions or
abstract propositions. An exception to this rule is created by this
section which provides for appeal on behalf of the people to review
decisions of trial courts on questions of law arising in criminal cases,
but such statutory review is not available in a proceeding in
delinquency, which is not a criminal case. People in Interest of GDK v. GDK,
30 Colo. App. 54, 491 P.2d 81 (1971).</T>
   <P></P>
   <T>
    <B>Constitutional jeopardy saving clause not applicable to
review by state.</B> Section 18 of art. II, Colo. Const., providing
that if a judgment in a criminal case is reversed for errors of law the accused shall
not be deemed to have been in jeopardy, must be reviewed as of the time
of its adoption and construed in the sense in which
the framers understood it, and it cannot be deemed to apply in a situation where the
people
on review by appeal obtain disapproval of a judgment of acquittal in a criminal
proceeding, since at the time of its adoption the people did not have the right
to sue out an appeal in a criminal case. Krutka v. Spinuzzi, 153 Colo. 115, 384 P.2d 928
(1963).</T>
   <P></P>
   <T>
    <B>The exception permitting a district attorney not to appeal a finding of
unconstitutionality when the same issue of constitutionality is already before another
court applies</B> only if it is the same issue of constitutionality, it does not apply if the
question of constitutionality is before a reviewing court on a different issue. People
v. Gilmore, 97 P.3d 123 (Colo. App. 2003).</T>
   <P></P>
   <T>
    <B>This section expressly provides that accused shall not be placed in jeopardy
a second time.</B> An accused person is not to be twice put in jeopardy by the
judgment
of the supreme court in an appeal prosecuted by the people under this section.
People v. Fitzgerald, 51 Colo. 175, 117 P. 135 (1911).</T>
   <P></P>
   <T>When an accused person is arraigned, tried and acquitted, he is, by the
express words of this section, allowing an appeal by the people,
not to be again put in jeopardy. People v. Denver Athletic Club,
63 Colo. 189, 164 P. 1158 (1917).</T>
   <P></P>
   <T>Where habitual criminal counts have been dismissed by the trial court after jeopardy
has
already attached on substantive charges, the Colorado
double jeopardy clause, § 18 of Art. II, Colo.
Const., prohibits a retrial of the defendant on habitual criminality. Appellate review
under
these
circumstances is limited to approval or disapproval of the judgment.

    <B>The prosecution may not cure a failure to timely file an interlocutory appeal of a
suppression order</B> by dismissing without prejudice the

    <B>By definition, it could not be used to appeal the ruling
on a jeopardy issue.</B>
People v. Voss, 191 Colo. 338, 552 P.2d 1012 (1976).</T>
   <P></P>
   <T>Where jeopardy has attached and the trial cannot be resumed,
there is no justification for reviewing a ruling suppressing
the evidence as an appeal under this section.
People v. Voss, 191 Colo. 338, 552 P.2d 1012 (1976).</T>
   <P></P>
   <T>
    <B>It precludes a second trial if acquittal is disapproved.</B> The provision
that nothing in this section shall be construed so as to place a defendant
in jeopardy for a second time for the same offense precludes a second
trial for the same offense, even though judgment of acquittal
is disapproved by the supreme court. Krutka v. Spinuzzi,

   <P></P>
   <T>This section permits a state to appeal from a verdict of acquittal

   <P></P>
   <T>
    <B>This section does not confer judicial or sentencing
powers on board.</B> Section 16-13-203 providing for commitment to a state
institution of not less than one day nor more than life, and subsection (2)
of this section authorizing the parole board to transfer such persons
after sentence to other institutions to effectuate purposes of act,
do not confer judicial powers on the parole board or involve the sentencing
authority of the court. Trueblood v. Tinsley, 148 Colo. 503, 366 P.2d 655 (1961),
cert. denied, 370 U.S. 929, 82 S. Ct. 1570, 8 L. Ed. 2d 507 (1962).</T>
   <P></P>
   <T>
    <B>Purpose of section.</B> The sex offenders act is concerned with the more
efficient control, treatment, and rehabilitation of persons convicted of sex
offenses. Control of the person must be assured before treatment and rehabilitation
is undertaken; this may require incarceration in the penitentiary.
Trueblood v. Tinsley, 148 Colo. 503, 366 P.2d 655
(1961), cert. denied, 370 U.S. 929, 82 S. Ct. 507,

   <P></P>
   <T>
    <B>It empowers the parole board to transfer persons</B> sentenced under
this act among institutions when deemed appropriate to effectuate purposes of
act. Trueblood v. Tinsley, 148 Colo. 503, 366 P.2d 655 (1961), cert. denied,

   <T>
    <B>Habeas corpus is not the remedy to rectify failure of the parole board
to perform its duty to transfer prisoners</B> under this section. Trueblood
v. Tinsley, 148 Colo. 503, 366 P.2d 655 (1961), cert. denied, 370 U.S. 929, 82 S. Ct.
1570, 8 L. Ed. 2d 507 (1962).</T>
   <P></P>
   <T>
    <B>Parole is a mere matter of privilege,</B> grace, or favor and a prisoner
is not entitled thereto as a matter of right. Trueblood v. Tinsley,
148 Colo. 503, 366 P.2d 655 (1961), cert. denied, 370 U.S. 929, 82 S. Ct.
1570, 8 L. Ed. 2d 507 (1962).</T>
   <P></P>
   <T>
    <B>If a parole board determines an inmate is in need of further treatment,</B>
it can condition parole upon participation in a sex offender treatment
program. Christensen v. People, 869 P.2d 1256 (Colo. 1994).</T>
   <P></P>
   <T>
    <B>Once a sex offender is sentenced to an indeterminate term under the sex
offenders act, the authority to make parole or release decisions rests with the
parole board.</B> Because sex offender's habeas corpus petition did not set
forth facts which, if proven, would entitle him to immediate release and he
alleged no facts showing that the parole board's denial of parole or release
was unconstitutional, defendant's petition must be dismissed. Christensen v.
People, 869 P.2d 1256 (Colo. 1994).</T>
   <P></P>
   <T>
    <B>The provisions of subsection (1) granting yearly parole consideration for persons
sentenced to an indeterminate term pursuant to § 16-13-203 conflict with the
provisions of § 17-2-201 (4)(a), which allow the parole board to consider parole for
sex offenders every three years.</B> Since § 17-2-201 (4)(a) is the later enacted
statute, the provisions of that section prevail. A person sentenced to an indeterminate
sentence pursuant to § 16-13-203 is entitled to parole consideration only every three
years. White v. Van Pelt, 55 P.3d 823 (Colo. App. 2002).</T>
   <P></P>
   <T>
    <B>Review satisfies procedural due process.</B>
The mandated review by the board of parole within six months after the
individual is committed and every year thereafter satisfies continuing
procedural due process requirements. People v. White, 656 P.2d 690 (Colo.
1983); People v. Kibel, 701 P.2d 37 (Colo. 1985).</T>
   <P></P>
   <T>
    <B>An order of mandamus to require the parole board to place the defendant in a
facility where he had access to sex offender treatment was properly denied.</B> This
section gives the parole board discretion as to whether to order a transfer based upon the
best interests of the inmate and public. Since an order of mandamus may only issue where
the plaintiff establishes both a clear right to the relief sought and a clear duty on the part of
the defendant to act, the court will not issue an order for relief that lies within the statutory
discretion of the parole board. White v. Van Pelt, 55 P.3d 823 (Colo. App. 2002).</T>

    <B>Purpose is the suppression of the unlawful nuisance.</B> Since the
purpose of this part is not the infliction of punishment against the offender,
that being left to the criminal law, but the suppression of the unlawful
keeping, the claim that keeping a bawdy house is a criminal offense
under the statute makes no difference and there can be no successful

  <P N="(5)(c)(VIII)"></P>
  <T>(VIII)<M>Whether the placing of the title in the name of, or the putative ownership
in,

claim of true ownership, nor does the person necessarily establish true ownership by
showing
the absence of fraudulent intent or badges of fraud.</M>

make
a party eligible to assert standing to contest the forfeiture thereof, unless the title to the
motor
vehicle, with transfer duly executed to the party, has been filed with the division of motor
vehicles in the department of revenue prior to the physical seizure of the vehicle and the
recording of a notice of seizure, or the party attempting to assert standing has exclusive
possession of the vehicle at the time of seizure. A party eligible to assert standing under
this
paragraph (e) must nevertheless establish that the party is a true owner of the vehicle or

an interest therein pursuant to paragraph (c) of this subsection (5).</M>

the
evidence presented raises an issue of proportionality under this paragraph (a.5), the
defendant may petition the court to set a hearing, or the court may on its own motion set
a

Colo.
Law. 2597 (1982).</T>
   <P></P>
   <T>
    <B>Two-pronged test</B> to determine whether a statutory forfeiture proceeding is
essentially criminal in character for purposes of double
jeopardy clause: (1) Whether general assembly expressly or impliedly
indicated a preference for criminal or civil categorization;
and (2) in the event the general assembly did indicate an intent to treat a forfeiture
proceeding as
civil, whether the statutory scheme is so punitive either in purpose or effect as to negate
the
legislative intention. People v. Milton, 732 P.2d 1199 (Colo. 1987);
People v. Ferrel, 929 P.2d 65 (Colo. App. 1996);
People v. Coolidge, 953 P.2d 949 (Colo. App. 1997).</T>
   <P></P>
   <T>
    <B>Forfeiture action pursuant to Colorado public nuisance statute</B> is essentially
civil in
nature, does not violate double jeopardy provisions
of the constitution, and is not subject to constitutional or
statutory speedy trial provisions applicable to criminal prosecutions.
People v. Milton, 732 P.2d 1199 (Colo. 1987).</T>
   <P></P>
   <T>
    <B>Based upon the civil nature of civil forfeiture proceeding, defendant did not
have
a constitutional right to counsel</B> and ineffective assistance of counsel is not a basis
for overturning the judgment of forfeiture. People v. Cobb, 944 P.2d 574 (Colo. App.
1996).</T>
   <P></P>
   <T>
    <B>Forfeiture action not dependent upon conviction in underlying criminal
case.</B> People ex rel. Sandstrom v. District Ct., 884 P.2d 707 (Colo. 1994).</T>
   <P></P>
   <T>
    <B>Function of forfeiture action is separate</B> from the punitive function
of a criminal conviction. People ex rel. Sandstrom v. District Ct., 884 P.2d
707 (Colo. 1994).</T>
   <P></P>
   <T>
    <B>The fact that statute defines a public nuisance</B> to include every vehicle used
in
the
commission of any felony not otherwise included in the
section did not transform forfeiture action into a criminal
proceeding subject to double jeopardy provisions. People v. Milton, 732 P.2d 1199
(Colo.
1987).</T>
   <P></P>
   <T>
    <B>Forfeiture action initiated under this section</B> did not violate the forfeiture of
estate
provision of section 9 of article II of the
Colorado constitution. People v. Milton, 732 P.2d 1199 (Colo. 1987).</T>
   <P></P>
   <T>
    <B>Action for abatement of class 1 public nuisance is equitable in nature,</B> and
while
the
court in the exercise of its equity powers may not
act contrary to the statutory mandate, it does retain a considerable
degree of discretion and flexibility in fashioning a decree which achieves a fair result, so
that
in
forfeiture situation, the court retains the
authority to protect the interest of an innocent party to the extent
practicable and within the statutory dispositional alternatives. People v. Garner, 732
P.2d
1194
(Colo. 1987).</T>
   <P></P>
   <T>
    <B>The general assembly has declared that forfeiture proceedings of public
nuisances are remedial and equitable in nature</B> and the trial court properly
determined that intervenor acquired an equitable interest in the vehicle based
upon his payment of $500. People v. One 1968 Chevrolet 2-Door, 895 P.2d 1177
(Colo. App. 1995).</T>
   <P></P>
   <T>
    <B>Trial court's determination that party contesting the forfeiture was true
owner of automobile was supported by evidence</B> because in its analysis of
the totality of the circumstances, court considered intervenor's equitable
interest, his good faith purchase for value without notice of the forfeiture,
and the undue hardship laced on intervenor if the vehicle were forfeited.
People v. One 1968 Chevrolet 2-Door, 895 P.2d 1177 (Colo. App. 1995).</T>
   <P></P>
   <T>
    <B>Reasonable notice of conduct within section's scope.</B>
This section makes reasonably clear to those intended to be affected
what conduct is within its scope.
People v. Perez, 192 Colo. 562, 561 P.2d 7 (1977).</T>
   <P></P>
   <T>
    <B>Property seized pursuant to this section is forfeited at the
time of seizure,</B> not upon entry of a final order.
United States v. Wilkinson, 686 P.2d 790 (Colo. 1984),
aff'd, 628 F. Supp. 29 (D. Colo. 1985).</T>
   <P></P>
   <T>
    <B>But only if there is a subsequent judgment of forfeiture.</B>
Eggleston v. Colo., 636 F. Supp. 1312 (D. Colo. 1986).</T>
   <P></P>
   <T>
    <B>Subsection (1)(c) is not unconstitutionally vague.</B>
The language is specific, persons of common intelligence
have no difficulty understanding the term "used" and in
comprehending the definition of "controlled substance",
and the language is sufficiently plain to give defendant
and others reasonable notice of the kind of conduct
prohibited by its terms.
People v. One 1967 Pontiac (GTO), 678 P.2d 1016 (Colo. 1984).</T>
   <P></P>
   <T>
    <B>This section does not require any number of incidents of prostitution
before a public nuisance may be found.</B>
People v. Perez, 192 Colo. 562, 561 P.2d 7 (1977).</T>
   <P></P>
   <T>
    <B>Subsection (3) permits classification of a vehicle as a class
one public nuisance</B> on the basis of a single sale of a controlled
substance which transpires within a vehicle. People v. One 1967
Pontiac (GTO), 678 P.2d 1016 (Colo. 1984).</T>
   <P></P>
   <T>
    <B>No requirement of "close proximity" standard for forfeiture of contents of
building
declared a public nuisance.</B> Since forfeiture statute
is a civil statute, once the people make a prima facie case that
contents of a house were used in criminal activity, burden shifts to the owner
of the property to show why it should not be seized. People v. Lot 23, 735
P.2d 184 (Colo. 1987).</T>
   <P></P>
   <T>
    <B>The use of the term "traceable" in subsection (3)(b) reveals
legislative intent to require that a direct connection be established</B>
between the alleged proceeds and the unlawful activity. People v. Cerrone,
780 P.2d 562 (Colo. App. 1989),
cert. denied, 785 P.2d 917 (Colo. 1989).</T>
   <P></P>
   <T>
    <B>The word "control" in subsection (6)(b)(II) encompasses any currency that is
legally the property of the defendant, as well as any currency that the defendant has the
authority or the power to manage or direct, even if such currency is not in the defendant's
actual physical possession when it is seized.</B> Thus, it is the general assembly's
intention that any currency seized from the control of a defendant who engaged in a
drug-related public nuisance is presumptively forfeitable. People v. Thirty-Three
Thousand Two Hundred and Twelve Dollars ($33,212.00) in U.S. Currency, 83 P.3d
1206 (Colo. App. 2003).</T>
   <P></P>
   <T>
    <B>The inclusion of subsection (1)(i) is a clear indication that
the general assembly did not intend for the enumeration of specific felonies
in the statute to be exhaustive.</B>
Legislative history indicates that the general assembly did not intend
to override the residual effect of subsection (1)(i) and
omit felony theft from the statute's coverage.
People v. One 1988 Mazda 323, 857 P.2d 569 (Colo. App. 1993).</T>
   <P></P>
   <T>
    <B>Storage for purposes of statute</B> denotes that an item is left at a
location for some period of time. It is not synonymous with possession.
Generally the term indicates duration and not a transient situation.
People v. One 1967 Ford Mustang, 781 P.2d 186 (Colo. App. 1989).</T>
   <P></P>
   <T>
    <B>Vehicle used in the commission of a robbery</B> is a class 1 public nuisance
and the entire vehicle is subject to forfeiture, not just the contents of the
vehicle. People v. Milton, 732 P.2d 1199 (Colo. 1987).</T>
   <P></P>
   <T>
    <B>Motor vehicle used to transport stolen items home was not subject
to forfeiture.</B>
The stipulated facts and evidence presented were inadequate to prove
that the motor vehicle was sufficiently connected to the thefts
to allow forfeiture.
People v. One 1988 Mazda 323, 857 P.2d 569 (Colo. App. 1993).</T>
   <P></P>
   <T>
    <B>This section requires the forfeiture of a vehicle</B> which has been
determined to be a class 1 public nuisance when there is at least one owner of
the vehicle who participated or acquiesced in the prohibited use
which led to the vehicle being declared a
public nuisance, notwithstanding the fact that a co-owner had no knowledge of
or a role in the creation of the nuisance. People v. Garner, 732 P.2d 1194
(Colo. 1987).</T>
   <P></P>
   <T>
    <B>Evidence showed only that defendant drove a vehicle to a location
where marijuana was cultivated,</B> which would not compel every reasonable
person to draw the inference that the vehicle was used in the manufacture,
cultivation, growth, production, or processing of marijuana. People v.
Wilson, 826 P.2d 404 (Colo. App. 1992).</T>
   <P></P>
   <T>
    <B>Forfeiture is proper</B> even though the vehicle was not used as a place
where illegal activities were conducted. This section requires only that
the vehicle was used to aid the illegal activity. People v. 1979
Volkswagen, 773 P.2d 619 (Colo. App. 1989).</T>
   <P></P>
   <T>
    <B>Summary judgment ordering forfeiture of real property, its contents, and
currency was proper</B> where motion was supported by affidavits describing a history
of sales and use of crack cocaine on the property by the defendant and her tenants, where
the defendant admitted to making sales of crack cocaine on one of the parcels of
property, and where repeated illegal drug use and sales took place on the property.
People v. Cobb, 944 P.2d 574 (Colo. App. 1996).</T>
   <P></P>
   <T>
    <B>This section mitigates some of the harshness</B> inherent in the principle of
forfeiture by exempting property from forfeiture if the court finds that the
possession of the property is not unlawful and the owner
was not a party to the creation of a nuisance and would suffer undue hardship
by the sale, confiscation, or destruction of the property. People v. Garner,
732 P.2d 1194 (Colo. 1987).</T>
   <P></P>
   <T>
    <B>There was no undue hardship by the confiscation
and sale</B> of the fixtures and contents of the premises, which were being
used for prostitution, where appellant knew of and profited
from his deliberate illegal activity.
People v. Perez, 192 Colo. 562, 561 P.2d 7 (1977).</T>
   <P></P>
   <T>
    <B>Burden of proof in forfeiture action</B> under Colorado public nuisance statute
rests
on
the state and must be proven by a preponderance of the
evidence. People v. Milton, 732 P.2d 1199 (Colo. 1987).</T>
   <P></P>
   <T>
    <B>The defendant need not be charged under the precise section defining
solicitation of prostitution</B> in order for the provisions of the
forfeiture section to apply. People v. 1979 Volkswagen, 773 P.2d 619 (Colo. App. 1989).</T>
   <P></P>
   <T>
    <B>Ample evidence in record</B> to support finding that business "was
continuously being used as a place of prostitution".

temporary restraining order. Such motion shall be filed within fourteen days of the time said
person is served with or otherwise has notice of the temporary restraining order. The motion
shall be set for hearing within fourteen days after its filing. At said hearing, the court shall
determine whether the various provisions of the temporary restraining order should remain
in effect pending final determination of the action. No part of the temporary restraining order
shall be vacated unless the proponent of the motion demonstrates that there is no probable
cause to believe that a public nuisance exists or that the public nuisance acts underlying the
action occurred, or that the proponent has a reasonable likelihood of prevailing on the merits
of the case with respect to the temporary seizure or closure of the property. No issue
regarding the forfeiture of the property shall be raised at the hearing on the motion, except
the court may consider an innocent owner defense pursuant to section 16-13-303 (5.2) by a
proponent who has not been charged in a parallel criminal action arising from the same
activity giving rise to the forfeiture proceedings. When the innocent owner defense is raised
as grounds for vacating the order, the issues at the hearing shall be limited to modifying the
order to provide for the use of the property during the pendency of the action by an innocent
owner, but only if such use is consistent with preserving it for forfeiture as to any other
interest. Such a modifying order may include, without limitation, reasonable provisions for
the continued occupancy of a residence, or the operation of a business and the sale or
disposition of business inventory. However, no such modifying order shall include the release
of currency. The determination of the facts by the court at the hearing is independent of and
shall not be considered in the determination of the same or similar facts in the adjudication
of any criminal charges arising out of the same occurrences. Any motion to vacate a

value of said property, with sureties to be approved by the court,
conditioned that he will immediately abate any such nuisance that exists
at the building, place, or real property and prevent
the same from being established or
kept thereat within a period of one year thereafter, the court, if
satisfied of his good faith and satisfied that such owner had not
conducted, used, maintained, or knowingly permitted the conducting, using, or
maintaining of such public nuisance, may order the building, place,

  </CATCH-LINE>
(1)<M>Any vehicle or personal property, including fixtures and contents of
a structure or building, as defined in section 16-13-301 (2), currency,
securities, or negotiable instruments, which has been or is being used in
any of the acts specified in section 16-13-503 or in, upon, or by means
of which any act under said section has taken or is taking place; or
any currency, negotiable instruments, securities, or other things of value
furnished or intended to be furnished by any person in exchange for any of
the acts listed in section 16-13-503; or any proceeds traceable to the
acts listed in section 16-13-503; or any currency, negotiable instruments,
or securities used or intended to be used to facilitate any of the
acts listed in section 16-13-503 are contraband property and shall be seized,
as well as any contraband article. Any peace officer or agent of a seizing
agency may seize and hold such property or articles if there is probable cause
to believe that such property or articles are contraband and the seizure is
incident to a lawful search. All rights and interest in and title to
contraband property shall immediately vest in the state upon seizure by a
seizing agency, subject only to perfection of title, rights, and interests in
accordance with this part 5. Neither replevin nor any other action to recover
any interest in such property shall be maintained in any court except as
provided in this part 5.</M>
  <P N="(1.5)"></P>
  <T>(1.5)<M>If a rental motor vehicle is seized pursuant to this part 5, the seizing agency
shall notify the motor vehicle rental company of the seizure if the motor vehicle is
identified
as a rental motor vehicle. The motor vehicle rental company may appear at the seizing
agency and request the return of the rental motor vehicle. The rental motor vehicle shall
be
returned to the motor vehicle rental company unless the motor vehicle must be
maintained
in the custody of the seizing agency for evidentiary purposes or if the seizing agency has
probable cause to believe the motor vehicle rental company, at the time of rental, had
knowledge or notice of the criminal activity for which the rental car was used.</M>

  <T>(2)<N></N>(a)<M>In any action seeking forfeiture of property pursuant to this part 5, any
person, including a lienholder, who seeks to contest the forfeiture shall establish by a
preponderance of the evidence such person's standing as a true owner of the property or a
true owner with an interest in the property.</M>
  </T>
  <P N="(2)(b)"></P>
  <T>(b)<M>To establish standing, the person shall first prove that the person has a
recorded
or registered interest in the property, or a bona fide marital interest in the property, if the
property is of a type for which interests can be, and customarily are, recorded or
registered
in a public office.</M>
  </T>
  <P N="(2)(c)"></P>
  <T>(c)<M>The person shall also prove that the person is a true owner of the property or
a
true owner of an interest in the property. The factors to be considered by the court in
determining whether a person is a true owner shall include, but need not be limited to:</M>
  </T>
  <P N="(2)(c)(I)"></P>
  <T>(I)<M>Whether the person had the primary use, benefit, possession, or control of the
property;</M>
  </T>
  <P N="(2)(c)(II)"></P>
  <T>(II)<M>How much of the consideration for the purchase or ownership of the property
was furnished by the person, and whether the person furnished reasonably equivalent
value
in exchange for the property or interest;</M>
  </T>
  <P N="(2)(c)(III)"></P>
  <T>(III)<M>Whether the transaction by which the person acquired the property or
interest
was secret, concealed, undisclosed, hurried, or not in the usual mode of doing business;</M>
  </T>
  <P N="(2)(c)(IV)"></P>
  <T>(IV)<M>Whether the transaction by which the person acquired the property or
interest
was conducted through the use of a shell, alter ego, nominee, or fictitious party;</M>
  </T>
  <P N="(2)(c)(V)"></P>
  <T>(V)<M>Whether the person is a relative, a co-conspirator, complicitor, or an
accessory
in the public nuisance act or acts or other criminal activity, a business associate in a legal
or
illegal business, one who maintains a special or close relationship with, or an insider with
respect to the perpetrator of the alleged public nuisance act or acts;</M>
  </T>
  <P N="(2)(c)(VI)"></P>
  <T>(VI)<M>Whether the person is silent or fails to call parties to testify or to produce
available evidence explaining the acquisition of the property or factors which may be
badges of fraud or deceit, or show lack of true ownership;</M>
  </T>
  <P N="(2)(c)(VII)"></P>
  <T>(VII)<M>Whether the timing of the transaction by which the person acquired the
property was during the pendency or threat of litigation, or during any time when the
person
knew, should have known, or had notice of the public nuisance act or acts or the threat of
a
forfeiture action;</M>
  </T>
  <P N="(2)(c)(VIII)"></P>
  <T>(VIII)<M>Whether the placing of the title in the name of, or the putative ownership
in,
or transfer to, the person was done with intent to delay, hinder, or avoid a forfeiture, or
for
some purpose other than ownership of the property;</M>
  </T>
  <P N="(2)(c)(IX)"></P>
  <T>(IX)<M>Whether the perpetrator of the alleged public nuisance act or acts has
absconded or is a fugitive from justice and the conveyance occurred after the flight, or
before
the flight, in any of the circumstances set forth in subparagraph (III) of this paragraph (c);</M>
  </T>
  <P N="(2)(c)(X)"></P>

rights can legally exist;</M>

general law of fraudulent transfers or conveyances.</M>
  </T>
  <P N="(2)(d)"></P>
  <T>(d)<M>The court shall consider the totality of the circumstances in determining
whether
a person is a true owner. A person contesting the forfeiture does not necessarily have to
show that all of the factors enumerated in paragraph (c) of this subsection (2) support the
claim of true ownership, nor does the person necessarily establish true ownership by
showing
the absence of fraudulent intent or badges of fraud.</M>
  </T>
  <P N="(2)(e)"></P>
  <T>(e)<M>No private sale or conveyance of a used motor vehicle shall be deemed to
make
a party eligible to assert standing to contest the forfeiture thereof, unless the title to the
motor
vehicle, with transfer duly executed to the party, has been filed with the division of motor
vehicles in the department of revenue prior to the physical seizure of the vehicle and the
recording of a notice of seizure, or the party attempting to assert standing has exclusive
possession of the vehicle at the time of seizure. A party eligible to assert standing under
this
paragraph (e) must nevertheless establish that the party is a true owner of the vehicle or
has
an interest therein pursuant to paragraph (c) of this subsection (2).</M>
  </T>
  <P N="(2)(f)"></P>
  <T>(f)<M>Unless the standing of a particular party is conceded in the complaint
initiating
the public nuisance action, a party must assert standing in the answer and fully describe
the
party's interest in the property which is the subject matter of the action, and submit a
verified
statement, supported by any available documentation, of the party's ownership of or
interest
in the property.</M>
  </T>
  <P N="(2.1)(a)"></P>
  <T>(2.1)<N></N>(a)<M>In any action to forfeit property pursuant to this part 5, the plaintiff,
in
addition to any other matter which must be proven in the plaintiff's case in chief, shall
prove
by clear and convincing evidence that possession of the property is unlawful, or that the
owner of the property or interest therein was involved in or knew of the subject act. The
plaintiff shall also prove by clear and convincing evidence that the property was
instrumental
in the commission or facilitation of the crime or the property constitutes traceable
proceeds
of the crime or related criminal activity.</M>
  </T>
  <P N="(2.1)(a.5)(I)"></P>
  <T>(a.5)<N></N>(I)<M>The claimant in an action brought pursuant to this part 5 may
petition
the court
to determine whether a forfeiture was constitutionally excessive. Upon the conclusion of
a
trial resulting in a judgment of forfeiture in an action brought pursuant to this part 5, if
the
evidence presented raises an issue of proportionality under this paragraph (a.5), the
defendant may petition the court to set a hearing, or the court may on its own motion set a
hearing to determine whether a forfeiture was constitutionally excessive. This
determination
shall be made prior to any sale or distribution of forfeited property.</M>
  </T>
  <P N="(2.1)(a.5)(II)"></P>
  <T>(II)<M>In making this determination, the court shall compare the forfeiture to the
gravity of the public nuisance act giving rise to the forfeiture and related criminal activity.</M>
  </T>
  <P N="(2.1)(a.5)(III)"></P>
  <T>(III)<M>The defendant shall have the burden of establishing by a preponderance of
the
evidence that the forfeiture is grossly disproportional.</M>
  </T>
  <P N="(2.1)(a.5)(IV)"></P>
  <T>(IV)<M>If the court finds that the forfeiture is grossly disproportional to the public
nuisance act and related criminal activity, it shall reduce or eliminate the forfeiture as
necessary to avoid a violation of the excessive fines clause of the eighth amendment of
the
United States constitution or article II, section 20, of the Colorado constitution.</M>

  <T>(b)<M>As used in paragraph (a) of this subsection (2.1), an owner was
"involved in or knew of the subject act" if it is established that:</M>

  <P N="(2.1)(b)(I)"></P>
  <T>(I)<M>The owner was involved in the subject act; or</M>

abate the illegal use of the property;</M>
  </T>
  <P N="(2.1)(b)(II)(B)"></P>
  <T>(B)<M>Notwithstanding the provisions of sub-subparagraph (A) of this subparagraph
(II), if the
plaintiff proves by clear and convincing evidence that the owner knew or had notice of
the
unlawful use of the property, the owner must prove by a preponderance of the evidence
that
the owner took reasonable steps to prohibit or abate the unlawful use of the property for
the
court to find the owner was not a party to the offense or related criminal activity.</M>

  <P N="(2.2)(a)"></P>
  <T>(2.2)<N></N>(a)<M>With respect to a partial or whole ownership interest in existence at

means any owner who:</M>

  <P N="(2.2)(a)(I)"></P>
  <T>(I)<M>Did not have actual knowledge of the conduct subjecting the property to
seizure
or notice of an act or circumstance facilitating the criminal activity or prior similar

facilitating the criminal activity by certified mail; or</M>
  </T>
  <P N="(2.2)(a)(II)"></P>
  <T>(II)<M>Upon learning of the conduct subjecting the property to seizure, took
reasonable
steps to prohibit the conduct. An owner may demonstrate that he or she took reasonable
action to prohibit such conduct if the owner:</M>

  <P N="(2.2)(a)(II)(A)"></P>
  <T>(A)<M>Timely revoked or attempted to revoke permission for those engaging in such
conduct to use the property; or</M>

  <T>(B)<M>Took reasonable actions to discourage or prevent the use of the property in
conduct subjecting the property to seizure.</M>
  </T>
  <P N="(2.2)(b)"></P>
  <T>(b)<M>With respect to a partial or whole ownership interest acquired after the
conduct
subjecting the property to seizure has occurred, the term "innocent owner" means a
person
who, at the time he or she acquired the interest in the property, had no knowledge that the
illegal conduct subjecting the property to seizure had occurred or that the property had
been
seized for forfeiture, and:</M>
  </T>
  <P N="(2.2)(b)(I)"></P>
  <T>(I)<M>Acquired an interest in the property in a bona fide transaction for value;</M>
  </T>
  <P N="(2.2)(b)(II)"></P>
  <T>(II)<M>Acquired an interest in the property through probate or inheritance; or</M>
  </T>
  <P N="(2.2)(b)(III)"></P>
  <T>(III)<M>Acquired an interest in the property through dissolution of marriage or by
operation of law.</M>
  </T>
  <P N="(2.2)(c)"></P>
  <T>(c)<M>An innocent owner's interest in property shall not be forfeited under any
provision of state law. An innocent owner has the burden of proving by a preponderance
of
the evidence that he or she has an ownership interest in the subject property. Otherwise,
the
burden of proof under this subsection (2.2) shall be as provided in subsection (2.1) of this
section.</M>
  </T>
  <P N="(2.2)(d)"></P>
  <T>(d)<M>A person who is convicted of a criminal offense arising from the same

  <P N="(2.3)"></P>
  <T>(2.3)<M>The prosecuting attorney shall set forth in the petition initiating
the forfeiture action pursuant to this part 5 the existence of any liens and

sought, the lienholder does not need to appear to preserve any interest in the
property which is the subject of the forfeiture action which such lienholder
may possess.</M>

affidavit, and citation upon him or her or by sending copies of such documents by certified
mail, return receipt requested, to the last-known address of such claimant. If the documents
are properly mailed to an address which the prosecutor has reasonable grounds to believe is
the last-known address of the potential claimant, said documents shall be deemed served
whether or not the claimant responds to the notice to claim them at the post office. Unknown
persons who may claim any interest in the property, persons whose addresses are unknown,

provided in this subsection (7) despite diligent good faith efforts may be served pursuant to

find said person in default and enter an order forfeiting said

of forfeiture as provided in this part 5. A default order of
forfeiture entered pursuant to this section shall only be set

    <B>Entry of default order of foreclosure did not violate defendant's due process
rights.</B> In a civil forfeiture case, due process requires that a prompt post-seizure
retention hearing before a neutral magistrate be afforded, with adequate notice, to all
claimants. Under the Colorado Contraband Forfeiture Act, defendant was entitled to
receive, and did receive, sufficient notice of the civil forfeiture proceeding. People v.
Vogel, 2020 COA 55, 463 P.3d 352.</T>
   <P></P>
   <T>
    <B>Defendant not entitled to appointed counsel in a civil forfeiture proceeding,</B>
so district court's order of default did not violate pro se defendant's sixth amendment
right to counsel. People v. Vogel, 2020 COA 55, 463 P.3d 352.</T>
   <P></P>
   <T>
    <B>Procedures set forth in the act are
exclusive, precluding other
remedies for persons claiming interest in forfeited property.</B> People v.
Merrill, 816 P.2d 958 (Colo. App. 1991).</T>
   <P></P>
   <T>
    <B>Failure of defendant to tender filing fee with the response, without any other
aggravating factor, does not constitute an extreme circumstance justifying striking the
pleading.</B> Since the pleading was improperly stricken, it was error to enter a default
judgment at the first hearing. People v. Davenport, 998 P.2d 473 (Colo. App. 2000).</T>
   <P></P>
   <T>
    <B>Respondent's written statement asserting privilege against
self-incrimination and requesting leave to submit documentation of ownership
of confiscated money at a later date did not comply with subsection (2)(d)(IV)
requirements</B> for a "verified statement, supported by documentation".
Therefore, respondent was in default and court properly determined that she
had not demonstrated standing entitling her to contest $10,000 forfeiture.
People v. Merrill, 816 P.2d 958 (Colo. App. 1991).</T>
   <P></P>
   <T>
    <B>Under this section, trial court had no authority to stay forfeiture
proceedings</B> on
basis of privilege against self-incrimination or to allow resolution of
related criminal proceedings. People v. Merrill, 816 P.2d 958 (Colo. App. 1991).</T>
   <P></P>
   <T>
    <B>Nor could court grant use immunity to respondent for statements made
in response to forfeiture petition.</B> Courts possess no inherent power to
grant immunity in these circumstances, nor is such power conferred by this
section. Controlling provisions are in § 13-90-118, which allows grant of
immunity only upon request of the prosecuting attorney. People v. Merrill,
816 P.2d 958 (Colo. App. 1991).</T>
   <P></P>
   <T>
    <B>District court did not err by entering the default order forfeiting defendant's
claimed interest in property when defendant did not file a proper response.</B>
Defendant's response was not proper because it did not comply with each of the
requirements of subsection (2)(d). People v. Vogel, 2020 COA 55, 463 P.3d 352.</T>

The general assembly hereby finds that persons who are
convicted of offenses involving unlawful sexual behavior and who are identified as sexually
violent predators pose a high enough level of risk to the community that persons in the
community should receive notification concerning the identity of these sexually violent
predators. The general assembly also recognizes the high potential for vigilantism that often
results from community notification and the dangerous potential that the fear of such
vigilantism will drive a sex offender to disappear and attempt to live without supervision.
The general assembly therefore finds that sex offender notification should only occur in
cases
involving a high degree of risk to the community and should only occur under carefully
controlled circumstances that include providing additional information and education to the
community concerning supervision and treatment of sex offenders.</SECTION-TEXT>

    <B>Prospective challenge.</B> Prospectively, and not retroactively,
a prisoner subject to a detainer under the interstate agreement on
detainers will have the right to challenge the procedures to
determine whether the interstate compact and the uniform
act have been complied with. Moen v. Wilson,

   <T>
    <B>Act implements speedy trial right.</B>
The uniform act is one of several Colorado statutes implementing a defendant's right to a
speedy
trial as provided in § 16 of art. II, Colo. Const. People v.
Bean, 650 P.2d 565 (Colo. 1982);
People v. Lewis, 680 P.2d 226 (Colo. 1984).</T>
   <P></P>

    <B>Rights under the act.</B> All rights under the act are statutorily and not
constitutionally

   <P></P>
   <T>
    <B>The purpose of the Uniform Mandatory Disposition of Detainers Act
(UMDDA)</B> is to
provide
a
mechanism for the disposition of detainers; without a
detainer, the act has no applicability. People v. Bolin, 712 P.2d 1002 (Colo. 1986).</T>
   <P></P>
   <T>The primary purpose of the UMDDA and the
Interstate
Agreement on Detainers (IAD) is to provide a mechanism for prisoners to insist upon speedy
and
final
disposition of
untried charges that are the subjects of detainers so that a prisoner's speedy trial rights and
any
prison rehabilitation programs initiated for the prisoners' benefit will not be disrupted or
precluded by the existence of these untried charges. People v. Higinbotham, 712 P.2d 993

   <P></P>
   <T>
    <B>In determining whether to dismiss charges</B> for lack of prompt notification, a
court
must consider more than the general factors underlying the constitutional right to a speedy
trial
because the
UMDDA effectuates other policies besides the
speedy
trial rights. People v. Higinbotham, 712 P.2d 993 (Colo. 1986).</T>
   <P></P>
   <T>A defendant is entitled to the dismissal of charges against him that underlie a detainer
as a
sanction for violation of the prompt notification requirement of § 16-14-102 (2) of
the
uniform act
unless the prosecution can demonstrate a lack of prejudice to the defendant resulting from
that
violation. People v. Higinbotham, 712 P.2d 993 (Colo. 1986); People v. Glasser, 293 P.3d
68 (Colo. App. 2011).</T>
   <P></P>

Provisions in this article mandating that prison authorities "forthwith"

to comply with the specified time requirements for commencing trial will
result in dismissal, are almost identical to the analogous provision in
the IAD. People v. Bean, 44 Colo. App. 373,

   <P></P>
   <T>
    <B>The general speedy trial statute, § 18-1-405, and not this
act, applies</B> to the retrial of charges on convictions overturned on
appeal. The UMDDA applies only to untried charges, and the charges
against this defendant, while still pending, were not untried.
People v. Campbell, 885 P.2d 327 (Colo. App. 1994).</T>
   <P></P>
   <T>
    <B>Filing of detainer not required.</B>
The right of a person in the custody of the department of corrections to
request final disposition of criminal charges and thereby to obtain a right
to trial within 90 days on those charges is not dependent
upon the filing of a detainer. People v. Campbell, 742 P.2d 302 (Colo. 1987);
People v. Trancoso, 776 P.2d 374 (Colo. 1989).</T>
   <P></P>
   <T>
    <B>Sufficiency of request.</B>
Addressing the request for disposition to the chief judge of the
appropriate court constitutes substantial compliance within the requirement
that the defendant give the court notice that he wishes to invoke the
provisions of the act. People v. Campbell, 742 P.2d 302 (Colo. 1987).</T>
   <P></P>
   <T>A prisoner's written request for disposition under this act, when sent
to the superintendent, is sufficient to satisfy the requirements of this
section. A prisoner's rights under this act cannot be defeated by the
superintendent's failure to comply with his statutory duties under §
16-14-103. People v. Trancoso, 776 P.2d 374 (Colo. 1989).</T>
   <P></P>
   <T>
    <B>Court did not err in denying consideration of defendant's request for final

   <P></P>
   <T>
    <B>Prison authorities must have "actual knowledge"

A person placed on parole remains in the legal custody of the department of

Where a prisoner has substantially complied with the provisions of this article
and the prosecution has actual notice of the prisoner's request, it is not an
abuse of discretion for the trial court to
dismiss pending charges under the article. The court shall dismiss the charges
with the prejudice if the prisoner complies with the act and the cause is not
brought to trial within 90 days.

   <P></P>
   <T>
    <B>For purposes of the UMDDA, "actual notice" means "actual knowledge".</B>
Merely sending a substantially compliant UMDDA request to the prosecution does not

    <B>Statutory period commences to run upon receipt of request, not upon subsequent

   <T>
    <B>Imposition of sanction.</B>
The prosecutor should have the burden of establishing lack of prejudice

    <B>Filing of detainer not required.</B>
The right of a person in the custody of the department of corrections to
request final disposition of criminal charges and thereby to obtain a right to

upon the filing of a detainer. People v. Campbell, 742 P.2d 302 (Colo. 1987).</T>
   <P></P>
   <T>
    <B>Where there was no action on part of defendant when trial was

   <P></P>
   <T>
    <B>Disposition within 90 days waived.</B> Failure of defendant's counsel to
object
to the trial date announced and to request an earlier date along with his
statement as to availability on the date announced by the court and his affirmative
request for a pretrial date to accommodate his convenience all amounted to
consent to the date and waiver of the specified 90 days subsequent to the
request for detainer disposition. Chambers v. District Court, 180 Colo. 241,
504 P.2d 340 (1972);
People v. Kimble, 692 P.2d 1142 (Colo. App. 1984), cert. granted, 697 P.2d 716 (Colo.),
cert. dismissed, 701 P.2d 17 (Colo. 1985).</T>
   <P></P>
   <T>Defendant voluntarily waived his objection that his request for final disposition of
detainer
was not transferred "forthwith" to the trial
court when he and his attorney acquiesced freely in a trial
date beyond the speedy trial period. People v. Martin, 707 P.2d 1005 (Colo. App. 1985).</T>
   <P></P>
   <T>
    <B>Defendant's speedy trial right was violated, and there was no waiver of rights
under this section by accepting a trial date outside the 180-day speedy trial period.</B>
Defendant's acquiescence in the trial date proposed by the court did not meet the express
waiver requirements of subsection (2). The court did not advise defendant that his assent
to the trial date would constitute a waiver of his speedy trial right, and defendant did not
expressly waive his speedy trial right on the record. Further, the UMDDA advisement
form attached to defendant's pro se request for speedy disposition did not advise him that
agreement to a trial date set beyond the 180-day limitations period would constitute an
implied waiver of his rights under the UMDDA. People v. Carr, 205 P.3d 471 (Colo.
App. 2008).</T>
   <P></P>
   <T>
    <B>Waiver of rights by participation in trial setting delays.</B>
A defendant effectively waives his rights to final disposition within the 90-day statutory
limitation
period by his active participation in
trial setting delays and in his agreement to the appropriate dates.
People v. Mascarenas, 666 P.2d 101 (Colo. 1983);
People v. Martin, 707 P.2d 1005 (Colo. App. 1985).</T>
   <P></P>
   <T>A defendant may waive his right to a final disposition within the 90-day

a waiver, such as active participation in trial setting delays, together
with agreement to the appropriate dates. People v. Martinez, 712 P.2d 1070
(Colo. App. 1985).</T>
   <P></P>
   <T>Extension of the 90-day time limit does not require the defendant's
personal consent. The limit was effectively tolled where the judge granted a
continuation for the defendant's benefit because the prosecution was ready to
proceed, but the defense counsel was not present. People v. Fleming, 900
P.2d 19 (Colo. 1995).</T>
   <P></P>
   <T>
    <B>A defendant's UMDDA rights can be waived by either the defendant or

   <T>Counsel's waiver, in defendant's presence, of the required advisement was a valid
waiver of defendant's UMDDA rights. People v. Yakas, 2019 COA 117, 461 P.3d 568.</T>
   <P></P>
   <T>
    <B>When defendant wanted to be represented by counsel and counsel could not be
prepared by the end of the speedy trial deadline, the court did not err</B> in giving
defendant
the choice between waiving his right to a speedy trial or the right to be represented by
effective counsel. People v. Bryant, 2013 COA 28, 316 P.3d 18.</T>
   <P></P>
   <T>
    <B>Defendant not entitled to relief</B> because defendant's actions of hiring new
counsel and then subsequently firing that counsel and representing himself, both of
which required a continuance, tolled the 180-day deadline. People v. Gess, 250 P.3d 734
(Colo. App. 2010).</T>
   <P></P>
   <T>
    <B>Defendant's speedy trial claim was invalidated by tolling the speedy requirement
within 90 days even though trial was not originally set within 90 days.</B> Defendant's
motion for a court-appointed expert tolled his speedy trial rights and defendant then
expressly waived his speedy trial right at the hearing granting a court-appointed expert.
People v. Garcia, 17 P.3d 820 (Colo. App. 2000).</T>
   <P></P>
   <T>
    <B>Defendant's request for a continuance of the trial date to allow defense counsel
more time to prepare tolled the 90-day time period for trial.</B> People v. Shreck, 107
P.3d 1048 (Colo. App. 2004).</T>
   <P></P>
   <T>
    <B>The 90-day time period was tolled where defendant contributed to the
delay</B> by not telling his counsel that he had requested final disposition
and the date for completion of the 90-day period. People v. Fleming, 900
P.2d 19 (Colo. 1995).</T>
   <P></P>
   <T>
    <B>Where a defendant permits a jury trial to proceed to a guilty verdict,</B>
there
is a
waiver of the act's benefits as a matter of law.
People v. Kimble, 692 P.2d 1142 (Colo. App. 1984), cert. granted, 697 P.2d 716 (Colo.),
cert. dismissed, 701 P.2d 17 (Colo. 1985).</T>
   <P></P>
   <T>
    <B>Waiver may be of limited scope and duration.</B> Trial court erred in
construing such a waiver as broad and perpetual. People v. Naulls, 937 P.2d 778 (Colo.
App. 1996).</T>
   <P></P>
   <T>
    <B>Time extended by motions for defendant's benefit.</B>
Where additional time is necessitated by motions made for defendant's benefit,
and reasonable continuances are ordered by the trial court to accommodate
defendant's motions, the time for bringing
defendant to trial under the uniform act may be extended. People v. Anderson,
649 P.2d 720 (Colo. App. 1982).</T>
   <P></P>
   <T>
    <B>Attorney may request continuance without client's approval.</B>
An attorney may stipulate to or request a continuance without obtaining
his client's personal approval. People v. Anderson, 649 P.2d 720 (Colo. App.
1982).</T>
   <P></P>
   <T>No abuse of court's discretion in determining that good cause existed for granting
continuance upon defense counsel's assertion that he would be unable to provide
defendant with effective assistance if required to go to trial on the scheduled date. People
v. Roberts, 2013 COA 50, 321 P.3d 581.</T>
   <P></P>
   <T>Second continuance was necessary to protect defendant's constitutional right to
effective assistance of counsel, and the length of the continuance was proper because of
recent disclosure by prosecution, because a potential conflict of interest existed, and
because good cause existed for substitution of counsel. People v. Roberts, 2013 COA 50,
321 P.3d 581.</T>
   <P></P>
   <T>
    <B>Continuance held to be for good cause.</B>
Defense counsel's unanticipated military obligations made adequate trial
preparation impossible. People v. Anderson, 649 P.2d 720 (Colo. App. 1982).</T>
   <P></P>
   <T>
    <B>Delay to get preliminary hearing not "good cause".</B> Delay
which results from a period of time required by the state
in order to get a preliminary hearing is not "good cause"
for the granting of a continuance. People v. Lopez, 41 Colo. App. 206, 587
P.2d 792 (1978).</T>
   <P></P>
   <T>
    <B>Delay not for good cause.</B> Fact that co-defendant who was not subject
to UMDDA had trial set for date after 90-day period is not good cause for
delaying defendant's trial. People v. Mueller, 851 P.2d 211 (Colo. App.
1992).</T>
   <P></P>
   <T>
    <B>Defendant did not expressly waive on the record his right to a speedy
disposition
under the UMDDA.</B> Defendant was at all times adamant about being tried within
the
180-day period. Consequently, the court erred in determining that defendant had waived
any UMDDA rights. People v. Roberts, 2013 COA 50, 321 P.3d 581.</T>
   <P></P>
   <T>
    <B>There is no untried "indictment, information, or complaint" where the
defendant has been convicted but not sentenced.</B> Thus, the provisions of the
UMDDA and the Interstate Agreement
on Detainers will not apply to sentencing detainers. Moody v. Corsentino,
843 P.2d 1355 (Colo. 1993).</T>
   <P></P>
   <T>An outstanding arrest warrant is not an "indictment, information, or
criminal complaint" which triggers the application of this section. People v.
McPherson, 897 P.2d 923 (Colo. App. 1995).</T>
   <P></P>
   <T>
    <B>Where trial court's ruling is based on a question of law, the standard of review is
de novo, rather than an abuse of discretion standard.</B> Trial court applied this section
to undisputed facts and concluded that dismissal was mandatory under the plain language
of the statute. People v. Carr, 205 P.3d 471 (Colo. App. 2008).</T>

testimony or documentary evidence in support of the application.</M>
  </T>
  <P N="(4)"></P>
  <T>(4)<M>Upon an application, the judge may enter an ex parte order, as
requested or as modified, authorizing or approving the interception of any wire, oral, or
electronic
communication within the territorial jurisdiction of the court in which
the judge is sitting and outside that jurisdiction but within the United
States in the case of a mobile interception device, if the judge
determines on the basis of the facts submitted by the applicant that:</M>

  <P N="(4)(b)"></P>
  <T>(b)<M>There is probable cause for belief that particular
communications concerning that offense will be obtained through the
interception;</M>
  </T>
  <P N="(4)(c)"></P>
  <T>(c)<M>Normal investigative procedures have been tried and have failed,
or reasonably appear to be unlikely to succeed if tried, or to be too

probable cause for belief that the facilities from
which or the place where the wire, oral, or electronic communications are to be
intercepted are being used, or are about to be used, in connection with
the commission of an offense or are leased to, listed in the name of,
or commonly used by the person alleged to be involved in the commission

  <T>(6)<M>An order entered under this section may not authorize or approve the
interception of any wire, oral, or electronic communication for any period longer than is
necessary to achieve the objective of the authorization nor in any event longer than thirty
days. Such thirty-day period begins the first day on which the investigative or law
enforcement officer begins to conduct an interception under the order or ten days after
the
order is entered, whichever occurs earlier. An extension of an order may be granted but
only
upon application for an extension made in accordance with subsection (2) of this section
and
the court making the findings required by subsection (4) of this section. The period of an
extension shall be no longer than the authorizing judge deems necessary to achieve the
purposes for which it was granted and in no event for longer than thirty days. Every order
and each extension thereof shall contain a provision that the authorization to intercept
shall
be executed as soon as practicable, shall be conducted in such a way as to minimize the
interception under this section, and must terminate upon attainment of the authorized
objective, or in any event in thirty days. No more than three extensions may be granted
for
any order entered under this section. In the event that the intercepted communication is in
a code or foreign language and an expert in that foreign language or code is not
reasonably
available during the interception period, minimization may be accomplished as soon as
practicable after such interception. An interception made pursuant to this section may be
conducted in whole or in part by government personnel or by an individual operating
pursuant to a contract with the government and acting under the supervision of an
investigative or law enforcement officer authorized to conduct the interception.</M>
  </T>
  <P N="(7)"></P>
  <T>(7)<M>If an order authorizing interception is entered pursuant to this
section, the order may require reports to be made to the judge who
issued the order, showing what progress has been made toward achievement
of the authorized objective and the need for continued interception.
Such report shall be made at such times as the judge may require.</M>
  </T>
  <P N="(8)(a)"></P>
  <T>(8)<N></N>(a)<M>The contents of any wire, oral, or electronic communication
intercepted
by any means authorized by this section shall, if possible, be recorded
on tape, wire, or other comparable device. The recording of the
contents of any wire, oral, or electronic communication under this subsection (8)
shall be done in such a way as will protect the recording from editing
or other alterations. Immediately upon expiration of the period of the
order, or extension thereof, the recording shall be made available to
the judge issuing the order and sealed under his directions. Custody of
the recording shall be wherever the judge orders. A recording shall not
be destroyed except upon an order of the judge and in any event shall
be kept for ten years. Duplicate recordings may be made for use or
disclosure pursuant to the provisions of this section. The presence of
the seal provided for by this subsection (8), or a satisfactory
explanation for the absence thereof, is a prerequisite for the use or
disclosure of the contents of any wire, oral, or electronic communication
or evidence
derived under this section.</M>
  </T>
  <P N="(8)(b)"></P>
  <T>(b)<M>Applications made and orders granted under this section shall be
sealed by the judge. Custody of the applications and orders shall be
wherever the judge directs. The applications and orders shall be
disclosed only upon a showing of good cause before a judge of competent
jurisdiction, and shall not be destroyed except on order of the judge to
whom presented, and in any event shall be kept for ten years.
Information obtained pursuant to a court order authorizing interception
of wire, oral, or electronic communications shall not be used, published,

except in accordance with the provisions of this article.</M>

  <T>(d)<M>Within a reasonable time, but not later than ninety days after
the filing of an application for an order of approval under this
section, which application is denied, or after the termination of the
period of an order or extensions thereof, the judge to whom the
application was presented shall cause to be served, on the persons named
in the order or the application, and such other parties to intercepted
communications as the judge may determine in his discretion is in the
interest of justice, notice of the following:</M>
  </T>
  <P N="(8)(d)(I)"></P>
  <T>(I)<M>The fact of the entry of the order or application;</M>
  </T>
  <P N="(8)(d)(II)"></P>

  </T>
  <P N="(8)(d)(III)"></P>
  <T>(III)<M>The fact that during the period wire, oral, or electronic
communications
were or were not intercepted. The judge, upon the filing of a motion,
may, in his discretion, make available to any such person or his counsel
for inspection such portions of the intercepted communications,
applications, and orders as the judge determines to be in the interest
of justice. On an ex parte showing of good cause to a judge of
competent jurisdiction, the serving of the matter required by this
paragraph (d) may be postponed.</M>
  </T>
  <P N="(9)"></P>
  <T>(9)<M>The contents of any intercepted wire, oral, or electronic
communication or the evidence derived therefrom shall not be received in evidence or
otherwise disclosed in any trial, hearing, or other proceeding in a
state court, unless each party, not less than ten days before the trial,
hearing, or proceeding, has been furnished with a copy of the court
order, and accompanying application, under which the interception was
authorized or approved. This ten-day period may be waived by the court
if it finds that it was not possible to furnish the party with the
information ten days before the trial, hearing, or proceeding and that
the party will not be prejudiced by the delay in receiving this
information.</M>
  </T>
  <P N="(10)"></P>
  <T>(10)<M>Any aggrieved person in any trial, hearing, or proceeding in or
before any court, department, officer, agency, regulatory body, or other
authority of the state of Colorado, or a political subdivision thereof,
may move to suppress the contents of any intercepted wire, oral, or electronic
communication or the evidence derived therefrom on the grounds that: The
communication was unlawfully intercepted; the order of authorization or
approval under which it was intercepted is insufficient on its face; or
the interception was not made in conformity with the order of
authorization or approval. This motion shall be made before the trial,
hearing, or proceeding unless there was no opportunity to make such
motion or the person was not aware of the grounds of the motion. If
the motion is granted, the contents of the intercepted wire, oral, or electronic
communication or the evidence derived therefrom shall not be received as
evidence. The
remedies and sanctions provided for in this section with respect to the interception of
electronic
communications are the only judicial remedies
and sanctions for nonconstitutional violations of this
section involving such communications.</M>
  </T>
  <P N="(11)"></P>
  <T>(11)<M>In addition to any other right to appeal, the state of Colorado
has the right to appeal from an order granting a motion to suppress made
under subsection (10) of this section, or the denial of an application
for an order of approval, if the person making or authorizing the
application certifies to the judge granting the motion or denying an
application that the appeal is not taken for purposes of delay. Such
appeal shall be taken within thirty days after the date the order was
entered and shall be diligently prosecuted.</M>
  </T>
  <P N="(12)"></P>
  <T>(12)<M>Any investigative or law enforcement officer who, by any means
authorized by this section, has obtained knowledge of the contents of
any wire, oral, or electronic communication or the evidence derived therefrom may
disclose such contents to another investigative or law enforcement
officer to the extent that this disclosure is appropriate in the proper
performance of the official duties of the officer making or receiving
the disclosure.</M>
  </T>
  <P N="(13)"></P>
  <T>(13)<M>Any investigative or law enforcement officer who, by any means
authorized by this section, has obtained knowledge of the contents of
any wire, oral, or electronic communication or the evidence derived
therefrom may use
those contents to the extent the use is appropriate in the official
performance of his official duties.</M>
  </T>
  <P N="(14)"></P>
  <T>(14)<M>Any person who has received, by any means authorized by this
section, any information concerning a wire, oral, or electronic communication or
any evidence derived therefrom, intercepted in accordance with the
provisions of this section, may disclose the contents of that
communication or derivative evidence while giving testimony in any
criminal proceeding in any court of this state or in a grand jury
proceeding.</M>
  </T>
  <P N="(15)"></P>
  <T>(15)<M>No otherwise privileged wire, oral, or electronic communication
intercepted
in accordance with, or in violation of, the provisions of this section
shall lose its privileged character.</M>
  </T>
  <P N="(16)"></P>
  <T>(16)<M>When an investigative or law enforcement officer, while engaged
in intercepting wire, oral, or electronic communications in the manner
authorized in
this section, intercepts wire, oral, or electronic communications relating to an
offense other than one specified in the order of authorization or
approval, the contents thereof and the evidence derived therefrom may be
disclosed or used as provided in subsections (12) and (13) of this
section only if an offense other than one specified in the order is an
offense which constitutes a felony under Colorado statutes. The
contents thereof and the evidence derived therefrom, as authorized by this section,
may be used under subsection (14) of this section only when authorized
or approved by a judge of competent jurisdiction when the judge finds
on subsequent application that the contents were otherwise intercepted
in accordance with the provisions of this section. This application
shall be made as soon as practicable.</M>

thwart interception by changing facilities; and</M>
  </T>
  <P N="(17)(a)(II)(C)"></P>
  <T>(C)<M>The judge finds that such purpose has been adequately shown.</M>

section do not apply pursuant to the provisions of paragraph (a)
of this subsection (17) shall not begin until the facilities from which, or the place where,
the
communication is to be intercepted is
ascertained by the person implementing the interception order. A provider of wire
or electronic communications service that has received an order pursuant to
subparagraph (II) of paragraph (a) of this subsection (17) may move the court to modify
or
quash
the order on the ground that its assistance
with respect to the interception cannot be performed in a timely or reasonable fashion.
The
court, upon notice to the government, shall decide such a motion expeditiously.</M>

   <P></P>
   <T>
    <B>Federal authorities given great weight in interpreting subsection (8)(a).</B>
Because subsection (8)(a) is closely patterned after and designed to implement a federal
wiretapping statute, federal authorities explaining the federal statute should be accorded
great weight in interpreting subsection (8)(a). People v. Baez-Lopez, 2014 CO 26, 322

   <P></P>
   <T>
    <B>Problem of electronic surveillance.</B>
The reason for the seriousness of the problem arises not from the fact
that particular conversations are not specifically described and specifically
authorized, but rather from the unmanageability generally of electronic
surveillance, for the area is peculiarly sensitive due to its effort to probe the
thoughts of man who is the object of the search. People v. Martin, 176 Colo. 322,
490 P.2d 924 (1971).</T>
   <P></P>

    <B>This section allows law enforcement officers to intercept telephone
communications</B> after having obtained judicial authorization upon a
showing of probable cause. People v. Martin, 176 Colo. 322,

   <P></P>
   <T>
    <B>Court order to be scrutinized under stringent standards.</B>
A court order authorizing the wiretapping of telephonic communications must
be scrutinized under the same stringent standards as other fourth amendment
searches and seizures. People v. Montoya, 44 Colo. App. 234, 616 P.2d 156 (1980).</T>

    <B>Crime within scope of section.</B> Where the crimes for which the defendant
is charged (possession, conspiracy to possess, possession for sale,
conspiracy to possess narcotic drugs for sale) have a minimum penalty
of from 2 to 10 years in the state penitentiary, he falls within the
scope of this section. People v. Martin, 176 Colo. 322,
490 P.2d 924 (1971).</T>
   <P></P>
   <T>
    <B>Monitoring conversations between husband and wife in visiting room of
jail is not wiretapping</B> or eavesdropping because such conversations are
not within the statutory definitions of "wire communication" and "oral communication".

    <B>Consensually overheard conversation not "eavesdropping".</B>
By the terms of § 18-9-304 (1)(a), a consensually overheard conversation
is not eavesdropping. People v. Palmer, 652 P.2d 1092 (Colo. App. 1982).</T>
   <P></P>

For the exclusionary application of subsection (10) to be
operative, it must not only be at the behest of an aggrieved
party, but, critically, it must be shown that the
communication was unlawfully intercepted. Moreover,
in order to make that determination, one must look
to the prohibitory statutes on wiretapping and
eavesdropping.

350 P.3d 905.</T>
   <P></P>
   <T>Subsection (10) does not require the suppression of an aggrieved person's statements
simply because they were derived from the illegally intercepted communications, but
instead
because the party who had illegally intercepted has been the one to "derive" other
evidence
therefrom. People in Interest of A.W., 982 P.2d 842 (Colo. 1999).</T>
   <P></P>
   <T>
    <B>Consensual eavesdropping not an "unlawful interception".</B>
Since §§ 18-9-303 and 18-9-304 do not prohibit or make
unlawful consensual recorded eavesdropping, where one party
to the conversation agrees to the recording, there is no
"unlawful interception" within the meaning of subsection
(10). Said subsection (10) is, therefore, not applicable, and the
evidence should not be suppressed.

A finding that lesser crimes are not intended by congress to be included

with a recognition to restrict application of the statute to crimes such

    <B>Right to suppress not impaired by grant of immunity.</B>
A grand jury witness has a statutory right to seek the suppression of intercepted

not impaired by the court's grant of transactional immunity since, while
such immunity adequately safeguards the witness's privilege against self-incrimination,
it does not protect the witness's privacy interest in the contents of the

might
be used in the future in some manner, an order granting the witnesses a

  </CATCH-LINE>
The general assembly
finds that a significant number of criminal offenders remain at
large in this state because law enforcement agencies often lack
information concerning criminal activity. In many instances
private citizens have information that, if known to law
enforcement agencies, would lead to the detection and apprehension
of such offenders. Private, nonprofit crime stopper organizations
that offer rewards for such information have been successful at
encouraging some citizens to come forward; however, even with the
offer of a reward, many citizens do not come forward because they
fear involvement and shun publicity. In order to remedy this
situation and to increase the effectiveness of crime stopper
organizations, the general assembly finds and declares that it is
appropriate to provide for the anonymity of any person who
provides information concerning criminal activity to a crime
stopper organization and to provide for the confidentiality of
crime stopper organization records.</SECTION-TEXT>

certificate.</M>
  </CATCH-LINE>
(1)<M>After a conviction, all applications for commutation of sentence or pardon for
crimes committed must be accompanied by a certificate of the respective superintendent
of the correctional facility, showing the conduct of an applicant during the applicant's
confinement in the correctional facility, together with such evidences of former good
character as the applicant is able to produce. Before the governor approves such
application, it must be first submitted to the present district attorney of the district in
which the applicant was convicted and to the judge who sentenced and the attorney who
prosecuted at the trial of the applicant, if available, for such comment as they may deem
proper concerning the merits of the application, so as to provide the governor with
information upon which to base the governor's action. The governor shall make
reasonable efforts to locate the judge who sentenced and the attorney who prosecuted at
the trial of the applicant and shall afford them a reasonable time, not less than fourteen
days, to comment on such applications. The requirements of this section are deemed to
have been met if the persons to whom the application is submitted for comment do not
comment within fourteen days after their receipt of the application or within such other
reasonable time in excess of fourteen days as specified by the governor, or if the
sentencing judge or prosecuting attorney cannot be located, are incapacitated, or are
otherwise unavailable for comment despite the good-faith efforts of the governor to
obtain their comments. Good character previous to conviction, good conduct during
confinement in the correctional facility, the statements of the sentencing judge and the
district attorneys, if any, and any other material concerning the merits of the application
must be given such weight as seems just and proper to the governor, in view of the
circumstances of each particular case, with due regard for the reformation of the accused.
The governor has sole discretion in evaluating said comments and in soliciting other
comments the governor deems appropriate.</M>
  <P N="(2)"></P>
  <T>(2)<M>The governor may grant pardons to a class of defendants who were
convicted
of the possession of up to two ounces of marijuana. The requirements of subsection (1)
of
this section do not apply to defendants who were convicted of the possession of up to
two
ounces of marijuana, but the governor may make any inquiry as deemed appropriate to
seek any relevant information necessary from any person or agency to reach an informed
decision.</M>

    <B>Delegation of governor's authority.</B>
Because this section defines "governor" to include persons authorized to perform the
functions of
governor, the governor may delegate his authority to review and sign extradition
documents.

   <T>
    <B>Purpose of extradition.</B> The United States constitutional
provision regarding extradition from one state to another was
adopted to promote justice, to aid the states in enforcing their
laws, and not to shield malefactors. Tinsley v. Woods, 135 Colo.
590, 313 P.2d 1006 (1957); Travis v. People, 135 Colo. 141, 308
P.2d 997 (1957).</T>
   <P></P>
   <T>The public purpose to be effected by extradition is to
prevent the successful escape of all persons accused of crime,
whether convicted or unconvicted, and to secure their return
to the state from which they fled for the purpose of punishment.
It is invoked to aid the administration of criminal justice
and to more certainly insure the punishment of the guilty.
Travis v. People, 135 Colo. 141, 308 P.2d 997 (1957);
Gottfried v. Cronin, 192 Colo. 25, 555 P.2d 969 (1976).</T>
   <P></P>
   <T>The several states adopted the provisions of this uniform act
so that one who commits a crime in one state cannot go to
a sister state to avoid prosecution, or cannot send agents
or accomplices from one state into another with impunity
while he remains out of the state where the crime is
perpetrated. Boyd v. Van Cleave, 180 Colo. 403, 505 P.2d
1305 (1973).</T>

   <P></P>
   <T>
    <B>And, therefore, extradition proceeding should not be utilized as a vehicle
to challenge acts undertaken by a sister state</B> to enforce their criminal laws.

530 P.2d 1274 (1975).</T>
   <P></P>
   <T>
    <B>Transfer of custody not a waiver of jurisdiction.</B>
This article contemplates that the mere transfer of custody to another jurisdiction
will not be deemed a presumptive or implied waiver of jurisdiction by the
demanding state. Schoengarth v. Bray, 200 Colo. 288, 615 P.2d 655 (1980).</T>
   <P></P>
   <T>
    <B>Waiver of state's right to extradite.</B>
A finding of a waiver of a state's right to extradite requires affirmative
evidence of a state's intent to waive jurisdiction over the fugitive
and will not be presumed from a silent
record. Schoengarth v. Bray, 200 Colo. 288, 615 P.2d 655 (1980).</T>
   <P></P>
   <T>
    <B>Construction of section.</B> Statutes providing for the
arrest and extradition of fugitives are in derogation of
constitutional guarantees of immunity from arrest and must
be strictly construed. Matthews v. People, 136 Colo. 102,
314 P.2d 906 (1957).</T>
   <P></P>
   <T>The extradition statutes should not be so narrowly construed
as to enable offenders against the laws of a state to find permanent
asylum in another state.

   <P></P>

    <B>The clause "any person charged with a crime"</B> includes

   <P></P>
   <T>
    <B>No probable cause necessary where person convicted and sentenced.</B>
No showing of probable cause is necessary for the extradition of a person
who has been convicted and sentenced. Morgan v. Miller, 197 Colo. 341,
593 P.2d 357 (1979).</T>
   <P></P>
   <T>
    <B>The phrase "fled from justice"</B> has generally
been interpreted to cover individuals who are merely
absent from the state when they are sought to answer
for a crime, irrespective of their manner of leaving
the state.
Gottfried v. Cronin, 192 Colo. 25, 555 P.2d 969 (1976).</T>
   <P></P>
   <T>
    <B>Reason for leaving jurisdiction of demanding state
immaterial.</B> For extradition purposes, it is immaterial
why the person demanded left the jurisdiction of the demanding state: he is
a fugitive within the meaning of this section if he was present
in the demanding state at the time of the commission of the
offense charged and thereafter departed for whatever reason.
Danielson v. Miller, 196 Colo. 537, 587 P.2d 788 (1978).</T>
   <P></P>
   <T>
    <B>Where demanding state voluntarily released fugitive to another
state.</B> Under this section, a person can be classified as a fugitive
from justice where the demanding state voluntarily released him to another
state to serve out his unexpired sentence there.
Gottfried v. Cronin, 192 Colo. 25, 555 P.2d 969 (1976).</T>
   <P></P>
   <T>
    <B>The United States constitution guarantees no right of asylum</B>
to a person who has committed a crime in one state or territory of
the United States and fled to another jurisdiction. Cutting v.

    <B>The governor of Colorado has no inherent powers of arrest

332 P.2d 486 (1958).</T>

charged with a crime in that state who has fled from justice and

83 (1962).</T>
   <P></P>
   <T>
    <B>Demanding state has right to extradition of fugitive.</B>
When demanding the return of a fugitive, the demanding state
does not seek a favor, but appears as a sovereign state demanding
rights granted to it by the constitution and laws of the United
States. Matthews v. People, 136 Colo. 102, 314 P.2d 906 (1957);
Olson v. People, 138 Colo. 310, 332 P.2d 486 (1958).</T>
   <P></P>
   <T>Constitutional rights to limitations on the use of evidence
on the issue of guilt or innocence are not at issue in the
rendition proceeding. What is in issue is the constitutional
right of the demanding state to have a defendant promptly
returned to that state on a showing of probable cause. North
v. Koch, 169 Colo. 508, 457 P.2d 915 (1969).</T>

   <P></P>
   <T>
    <B>A sister state may proceed in extradition in either of
two ways:</B> (1) Make a demand upon any state for return of a
fugitive under the constitution and laws of the United States
and this section; or (2) make demand upon the governor of
Colorado for surrender under § 16-19-107 for any person
in this state charged in another state with committing an act
in this state, or in a third state, intentionally resulting
in a crime in the state whose executive authority is making
the demand. Matthews v. People, 136 Colo. 102, 314 P.2d 906 (1957);
Olson v. People, 138 Colo. 310, 332 P.2d 486 (1958); Layher v.

   <P></P>
   <T>
    <B>Form complied with § 16-19-104.</B> Demand for
extradition complied with § 16-19-104 although the
requisition documents contained both a demand for
extradition, pursuant to this section, and a request for
extradition predicated on § 16-19-106, which controls
executive agreements, since the executive agreement, which
accompanied the requisition documents, served only to ensure
that the demanding state would return and surrender defendant
to the Colorado authorities upon the completion of the trial
in the demanding state. Buffalo v. Tanksley, 189 Colo. 45,

   <P></P>
   <T>
    <B>Presumption of defendant's presence in demanding state at time of crime.</B>
The issuance of a governor's warrant by the governor of the asylum state
creates a presumption that the person sought to be extradited was in the
demanding state at the time the crime was committed.
The person whose extradition is sought must show by clear and convincing
evidence that he was not in the demanding state at the time the crime was
committed. Light v. Cronin, 621 P.2d 309 (Colo. 1980);

No demand for the extradition of a person charged with crime in another

confinement or has broken the terms of his bail, probation, or parole. The
indictment, information, or affidavit made before the magistrate must
substantially charge the person demanded with having committed a crime

It is fundamental that the statutory grounds in this section,

   <T>
    <B>Allegation of presence in demanding state in governor's warrant
creates presumption.</B> The requirement that the person sought to be
extradited be shown to be in the state when the crime was committed
is satisfied by an allegation to that effect in a governor's warrant,
which creates a presumption that the accused was in the demanding state
at the time the offense was committed. Graham v. Vanderhoof, 185 Colo. 334,

the governor of the asylum state has two questions to pass upon:
(1) Is the person demanded substantially charged with a crime

from the justice of the demanding state? The first of these
questions is one of law, while the second is one of fact.

    <B>Indictment need not allege elements of crime.</B> Upon
the trial of the issue of guilt, it would doubtless be necessary
for the prosecution to prove an essential element of the crime.
It is not necessary that the indictment should contain any such
allegation. The indictment did "substantially charge" the
petitioner with the crime of sodomy; being a crime known to
the common law, further statutory definition of the word sodomy
was unnecessary. Beliajus v. Phillips, 170 Colo. 212, 460 P.2d

   <T>
    <B>Or prove criminal intent.</B> The question of criminal intent
is relevant only to the sufficiency of the demand for extradition.
It is not an element to be proved in the responding state. Instead,
it is a jurisdictional fact which must appear from the face
of the supporting documents. Where the basis for extradition
is that defendant has been charged in California in the manner
provided in this section with committing an act in this state,
or in a third state, intentionally resulting in a crime in
California, the trial court was under no duty to admit the
evidence offered to prove that defendant was financially
unable to make the support payments to negate the intent to
commit a crime. Conrad v. McClearn, 166 Colo. 568, 445

    <B>The asylum state has no authority to pass on the
technical sufficiency of an indictment</B> in an interstate

mandates the relinquishment of any person "charged" with a crime who has fled
from justice and is in another state, so long as the
sentence resulting from conviction is unsatisfied.
Consequently, a parolee is subject to extradition as a fugitive
because, as a convict with an unexpired sentence, he remains criminally "charged".
His extradition is for his original offense.

be extradited. The paroled prisoner is declared to be a
fugitive from justice on the ground that he is a convict whose

is the actual basis for extradition, the statute requires only an accompanying

for 16 years and was in charge of the official custody and control records of the
appellant at the reformatory; and that he knew, from these records and his own personal
knowledge, that appellant did escape from the reformatory, leaving while on a hospital
trip to Louisville, Kentucky, the complaint and affidavit is sufficient to establish
probable cause that appellant had committed the substantive crime of escape under
the Kentucky statute. Norrod v. Bower, 187 Colo. 421,

   <P></P>

    <B>Prima facie showing of identity.</B> Where the name

(1975);
Guy v. Nelson, 630 P.2d 610 (Colo. 1981).</T>
   <P></P>
   <T>Identity of name with the extradition documents is sufficient

by the appellant's evidence showing lack of identity, the prima
facie showing is sufficient to establish identity.

   <P></P>
   <T>Once the prosecution has established a prima facie showing of identity, the person
charged
as
a fugitive must show that he is not the person sought
by the demanding state. Beam v. McKinster, 652 P.2d 618 (Colo. 1982).</T>
   <P></P>
   <T>Once a prima facie case for extradition has been established, the burden devolves
upon
the
accused to prove by clear and convincing evidence either that he is not a fugitive from
the
demanding state
or that he is not substantially charged with a crime in that state.

   <P></P>
   <T>However, the use of a "a/k/a" as a means of identifying a fugitive in a complaint,
standing
alone, is not sufficient to establish a prima facie
showing of identity. Cates v. Sullivan, 696 P.2d 322 (Colo. 1985).</T>
   <P></P>
   <T>But the use of "a/k/a" documentation coupled with a description and photograph of
the
fugitive is sufficient to establish a prima facie showing of
identity. Cates v. Sullivan, 696 P.2d 322 (Colo. 1985).</T>
   <P></P>
   <T>
    <B>Clear and convincing evidence must be shown by accused</B>
that he is not the person sought in order to rebut the prima facie showing
of identity. Guy v. Nelson, 630 P.2d 610 (Colo. 1981).</T>
   <P></P>
   <T>Where petitioner failed to introduce evidence that he was not the person described in
the
requisition documents and the cross-examination of the respondents' witnesses did not
create
such
evidence,
the petitioner failed to establish that he was not the person described in the documents.

   <P></P>
   <T>
    <B>An information not required with indictment.</B> The trial
court was in error to discharge a fugitive for lack of an
information for no such information is required. It is
sufficient that a certified copy of the indictment, charging
the passing of a worthless check, and other papers relating
thereto, including a requisition, were forwarded from the
governor of Tennessee and that the governor of Colorado
issued a warrant for petitioner's arrest on the basis of
such papers. Capra v. Miller, 161 Colo. 448, 422 P.2d 636

   <P></P>
   <T>
    <B>Statements as to escape and copy of judgment are sufficient.</B> In
cases where persons are sought as escapees from state prison, all
that is required for extradition is either a copy of the judgment
of conviction or of a sentence imposed in execution thereof,
together with a statement by the executive authority of the
demanding state that the person claimed has escaped from confinement.

the governor of the demanding state alone, and his certification
of that fact is all that is required. Burnette v. McClearn, 162

   <P></P>

Rush v. Baker, 188 Colo. 136,

   <P></P>
   <T>Certification of extradition documents is not defective because there is
no authorization included to show that the chief deputy clerk could sign
for the clerk of the court when the demanding state's governor's authentication
covers all the documents including the affidavits of probable cause and
the arrest warrant. Absent some showing that the documents are spurious,

agreement, which accompanied the requisition documents, served
only to ensure that the demanding state would return and
surrender defendant to the Colorado authorities upon the

A

No person arrested upon such a warrant shall be delivered over to the
agent whom the executive authority demanding him has appointed to
receive him unless he shall first be taken forthwith before a judge of a
court of record in this state, who shall inform him of the demand made for
his surrender and of the crime with which he is charged and that he has
the right to demand and procure legal counsel. If the prisoner or his
counsel states that he or they desire to test the legality of his
arrest, the judge of the court of record shall fix a reasonable time to be
allowed him within which to apply for a writ of habeas corpus. When such
writ is applied for, notice thereof, and of the time and place of hearing
thereon, shall be given to the prosecuting officer of the county in which
the arrest is made and in which the accused is in custody and to the agent
of the demanding state.
Review beyond the court of record shall be only in the supreme court by
petition for certiorari, pursuant to such rules as that court may promulgate.</SECTION-TEXT>

   <P></P>
   <T>
    <B>Habeas corpus proceedings are civil rather than criminal</B> in nature,

   <P></P>
   <T>Despite a common-law and constitutional tradition which treat habeas corpus as a
civil matter and as a matter to which criminal due process safeguards do not attach,
the supreme court is of the opinion that this tradition does not comport with recent
developments in the constitutional law. The administration of criminal procedural
safeguards must look beyond form to substance. Mora v. District Court, 177 Colo. 381,

   <P></P>
   <T>
    <B>Section provides right to counsel.</B> The language of this section establishes

   <P></P>
   <T>This section contemplates a hearing on the legality of the prisoner's detention,

   <P></P>
   <T>
    <B>Inquiry in habeas corpus proceeding severely restricted.</B>
In the interests of comity and speedy resolution of extradition matters, the
inquiry by the courts of Colorado, the asylum state, in a habeas corpus proceeding,
is severely restricted, and the accused is left to pursue his remedies in the courts
of the demanding state. Rush v. Baker, 188 Colo. 136,
533 P.2d 36 (1975).</T>
   <P></P>
   <T>
    <B>Scope of inquiry limited.</B> The scope of inquiry in a habeas
corpus proceeding in the context of a request for extradition under
this article is narrowly limited to the issues of: (1) The technical
sufficiency of the extradition papers; (2) identification of the
accused; (3) whether the accused is charged with a crime; and (4)
whether the accused is a fugitive from justice.
Lomax v. Cronin, 194 Colo. 523, 575 P.2d 1285 (1978);
Steinman v. Caldwell, 628 P.2d 110 (Colo. 1981);
Gagan v. Gately, 673 F. Supp. 1029 (D. Colo. 1987).</T>
   <P></P>
   <T>At habeas corpus proceedings to consider the validity of an extradition
warrant, the only questions which may be presented to the court by the habeas
corpus petition are whether the prisoner is lawfully detained and whether
the requirements of extradition have been met. Massey v. Wilson, 199 Colo.
121, 605 P.2d 469 (1980); Simmons v. Leach, 626 P.2d 164 (Colo. 1981).</T>
   <P></P>
   <T>
    <B>When asylum state's court to make determination of probable cause.</B>
The fourth amendment interests of a person against whom extradition is sought are
protected
upon a habeas corpus review where the courts of the asylum state examine the extradition
documents to
determine whether probable cause has been found by a neutral court in the demanding
state.
If no
determination of probable cause by the courts of the demanding state appears in the
extradition
documents, the courts in the asylum state are required to make an independent
determination
from
the extradition documents as to whether probable cause exists.
Lutrell v. Williams, 660 P.2d 499 (Colo. 1983).</T>
   <P></P>
   <T>
    <B>Courts in asylum state have no duty to inquire into substantive law and
pleading practices</B> of the demanding state. Simmons v. Leach, 626 P.2d
164 (Colo. 1981).</T>
   <P></P>
   <T>
    <B>Court may not nullify extradition on own motion.</B> A trial court may not
disregard the provisions of this section and of its own motion nullify an extradition
warrant without the filing of a petition for a writ of habeas corpus by the accused
showing substantial grounds why the extradition should not be enforced. Krutka v.
Bryer, 150 Colo. 293, 372 P.2d 83 (1962).</T>
   <P></P>
   <T>
    <B>The accused has the right to proffer evidence in aid of his discharge.</B>
Krutka v. Bryer, 150 Colo. 293, 372 P.2d 83 (1962).</T>
   <P></P>
   <T>
    <B>But not to try questions of guilt or innocence.</B> The guilt or innocence
of the alleged fugitive may not be considered by the court of the asylum state
in habeas corpus proceedings. Dressel v. Bianco, 168 Colo. 517, 452 P.2d 756 (1969).</T>
   <P></P>
   <T>Since an extradition proceeding is designed only to convey the petitioner to
the proper jurisdiction for trial, his guilt or innocence and any issue as to his
sanity as it relates to his guilt or innocence or ability to stand trial are not
issues at the extradition hearing, but rather at the trial in the demanding state.
Luker v. Koch, 176 Colo. 75, 489 P.2d 191 (1971).</T>
   <P></P>
   <T>Although questions concerning the petitioner's sanity as it affects his ability to stand
trial
are
properly addressed to courts in the demanding
state, the petitioner's competency may also be the subject of
inquiry by the asylum state if it affects the petitioner's ability to understand and assist
counsel in
handling the issues involved in the habeas
corpus proceeding itself. Gagan v. Gately, 673 F. Supp. 1029 (D. Colo. 1987).</T>
   <P></P>
   <T>
    <B>Such as date of crime.</B> In an extradition hearing, the time of the
commission
of the crime is material; however, the precise date alleged does not necessarily have
to be proved and where, for the purpose of extradition, trial court ruled that any
date in a certain month was sufficient to advise accused of the charge against him,
it was held that under the evidence and special circumstances of the case, trial court's
ruling was correct. Osborne v. Van Cleave, 173 Colo. 26, 475 P.2d 625 (1970).</T>
   <P></P>
   <T>
    <B>Or alibi.</B> Habeas corpus is not the proper proceeding to try the question of
alibi, or any question as to the guilt or innocence of the accused. Osborne v. Van
Cleave, 173 Colo. 26, 475 P.2d 625 (1970); Eathorne v. Nelson, 180 Colo. 288, 505 P.2d
1 (1973).</T>
   <P></P>
   <T>
    <B>Or validity of arrest or detention.</B> The fugitive cannot, in opposition to
proper extradition proceedings, urge the fact that his original arrest or detention
was illegal, once proceedings have been instituted, it is too late to claim that the
preliminary detention in the asylum state was illegal. Travis v. People, 135 Colo.
141, 308 P.2d 996 (1957).</T>
   <P></P>
   <T>The fact that the defendant was originally arrested in Colorado on a charge
different than the one upheld by requisition is immaterial and moot. Extradition
proceedings on the charge of passing a worthless check were properly instituted and
the validity of his initial arrest is not in issue in the proceeding to determine
whether the discharge of the person was valid. Capra v. Miller, 161 Colo. 448, 422
P.2d 636 (1967).</T>
   <P></P>
   <T>The illegality of an initial arrest cannot be challenged in an extradition
proceeding growing out of that arrest. Luker v. Koch, 176 Colo. 75, 489 P.2d 191
(1971).</T>
   <P></P>
   <T>Where accused petitioned for writ of habeas
corpus after issuance of governor's warrant for accused's extradition to
another state, any issue arising out of any alleged wrongful detention preceding
the service of the governor's warrant was moot. Crumrine v. Erickson, 186 Colo. 139,
526 P.2d 148 (1974).</T>
   <P></P>
   <T>Once the governor's warrant has been issued, the question of the validity of
the initial arrest becomes moot and may not be raised in habeas corpus
proceedings which test the validity of the detention under the governor's warrant.
McCoy v. Cronin, 187 Colo. 364,
531 P.2d 379 (1975).</T>
   <P></P>
   <T>After a valid governor's warrant has been issued and served, any illegalities
and irregularities which relate to the initial arrest of the fugitive become
moot. Simmons v. Leach, 626 P.2d 164 (Colo. 1981).</T>
   <P></P>
   <T>
    <B>Or violations of parole.</B> In habeas corpus proceedings involving
extradition
the courts cannot consider the question of whether or not the petitioner has violated
his parole. Travis v. People, 135 Colo. 141, 308 P.2d 997 (1957).</T>
   <P></P>
   <T>
    <B>Or the constitutionality of statute charging crime in demanding state.</B>
Accused could not avoid extradition to another state on argument that statute charging
him with crime in other state was unconstitutional. Rather, the principle of comity
required the accused to test the statute's constitutionality in the courts
of that state. Denton v. Cronin, 187 Colo. 247,
529 P.2d 644 (1974).</T>
   <P></P>
   <T>
    <B>Or death penalty.</B> Where accused proposes that Colorado
ought not give aid and assistance to Oklahoma in enforcing its
death penalty which he alleges is unconstitutional, this position
presents no issue justiciable in the Colorado courts in an
extradition proceeding. Pickinpaugh v. Lamm, 189 Colo. 143,
538 P.2d 113 (1975).</T>
   <P></P>
   <T>
    <B>Defendant's claim that his federal constitutional rights
were violated in the asylum state</B> does not require habeas
corpus relief, nor does it deprive the Colorado courts of
jurisdiction over the defendant. Yellen v. Nelson, 680 P.2d
234 (Colo. 1984).</T>
   <P></P>
   <T>
    <B>Alleged denial of speedy trial and due process by demanding state.</B>
Issues of whether petitioner has been denied his constitutional rights to
a speedy trial and due process by demanding state's delay in proceeding
with extradition are not justiciable in a habeas corpus action brought in
Colorado grounded upon a demand for extradition. Simmons v. Leach, 626
P.2d 164 (Colo. 1981).</T>
   <P></P>
   <T>
    <B>When prisoner released for state's failure to comply with constitutional
requirements, he remains subject to extradition proceedings.</B> When the
prisoner is released because the demanding state or the asylum state has
failed to comply with statutory or constitutional requirements, the prisoner
remains a fugitive from the demanding state and subject to that state's
constitutional right to demand his return. Massey v. Wilson, 199 Colo.
121, 605 P.2d 469 (1980).</T>
   <P></P>
   <T>
    <B>Effect of writ on prosecution of underlying charge.</B>
Where New Mexico properly granted a writ of habeas corpus on the grounds of technical
insufficiency of the extradition documents, Colorado is not estopped from prosecuting
the
defendant on the merits
of the underlying charges. People v. Coyle, 654 P.2d 815 (Colo. 1982).</T>
   <P></P>
   <T>
    <B>Courts of asylum state may not consider certain allegations.</B>
The courts of the asylum state in a habeas corpus proceeding under
this article may not properly consider allegations that the
fugitive's life would be endangered by return to the demanding
state. The accused, in respect to this matter, must pursue his
remedies in the demanding state or with the executive of the
asylum state.
Lomax v. Cronin, 194 Colo. 523, 575 P.2d 1285 (1978).</T>
   <P></P>
   <T>
    <B>Identification testimony at extradition hearing is not tested by same
standards applied at trial</B> on the merits. Eathorne v. Nelson, 180 Colo. 288, 505
P.2d 1 (1973).</T>
   <P></P>
   <T>
    <B>Sanity a question only if accused unable to assist counsel.</B> The only
conceivable situation in which a court in the asylum state might be required
to consider sanity would be one in which the petitioner is so incompetent as to
be totally unable to assist his counsel in a habeas corpus proceeding in connection
with a pending extradition. Luker v. Koch, 176 Colo. 75, 489 P.2d 191 (1971).</T>
   <P></P>
   <T>"Total inability to assist counsel" test disavowed in favor of "sufficient present
ability
to
consult with attorney" test. Pruett v. Barry, 696 P.2d 789 (Colo. 1985).</T>
   <P></P>
   <T>
    <B>Issue is right of demanding state to defendant's return.</B> Constitutional
rights to limitations on the use of evidence on the issue of guilt or innocence
are not at issue in the rendition proceeding. What is in issue is the constitutional
right of the demanding state to have the defendant promptly returned to that state
on a showing of probable cause. North v. Koch, 169 Colo. 508, 457 P.2d 915 (1969).</T>
   <P></P>
   <T>
    <B>This involves narrow determination of compliance with statute.</B> Habeas
corpus, in the instance of interstate extradition, involves a narrow determination
of whether there has been compliance with the statutory elements of whether the
petitioner: (1) Was present in the demanding state at the time charged in the
governor's warrant and the extradition proceedings; (2) was substantially charged
with a crime; and (3) is a fugitive from justice. Petition of Harwell, 180 Colo. 144,
503 P.2d 618 (1972).</T>
   <P></P>
   <T>The scope of inquiry in habeas corpus proceedings is narrowly limited to the
technical sufficiency of the papers and: (1) The identification of the accused; (2)
whether the accused has been charged with a crime; and (3) whether the accused is
a fugitive from justice.
Luker v. Koch, 176 Colo. 75, 489 P.2d 191 (1971).</T>
   <P></P>
   <T>A habeas corpus proceeding has limited scope and is intended to resolve the
issue of whether the person in custody is lawfully detained. Eathorne
v. Nelson, 180 Colo. 288, 505 P.2d 1 (1973).</T>
   <P></P>
   <T>
    <B>Evidence required to overcome presumption of validity.</B>
An accused who seeks to invalidate an extradition must overcome
the presumption of validity afforded by the governor's warrant by
clear and convincing evidence.
Lomax v. Cronin, 194 Colo. 523, 575 P.2d 1285 (1978).</T>
   <P></P>
   <T>
    <B>The warrant of arrest is prima facie evidence of the recitals therein</B>
in a habeas corpus proceeding. Capra v. Miller, 161 Colo. 448, 422 P.2d 636 (1967).</T>
   <P></P>
   <T>The warrant of the governor as to the status of the accused as a fugitive
from justice of the demanding state is prima facie proof of such status which must
be overcome to justify a discharge from custody. Krutka v. Bryer, 150 Colo. 293,
372 P.2d 83 (1962).</T>
   <P></P>
   <T>
    <B>It places the burden upon the accused</B> to show either that he is not a
fugitive from justice or that he was not substantially charged with a crime in
the demanding state. Capra v. Miller, 161 Colo. 448, 422 P.2d 636 (1967).</T>
   <P></P>
   <T>A petitioner who believes that the demanding state's requisition papers
do not support the warrant of the governor of the asylum state has the
responsibility of going forward with the matter and controvert the warrant
by introducing the requisition papers into evidence. Mote v. Koch, 173 Colo.
82, 476 P.2d 255 (1970).</T>
   <P></P>
   <T>
    <B>The burden is to show by clear and convincing evidence that defendant
was absent at the time of the crime</B> charged from Texas. Dressel v. Bianco,
168 Colo. 517, 452 P.2d 756 (1969).</T>
   <P></P>
   <T>The courts will not discharge a defendant arrested under a governor's warrant
where there is merely contradictory evidence on the subject of presence in or
absence from the state. Osborne v. Van Cleave, 173 Colo. 26, 475 P.2d 625 (1970);
Eathorne v. Nelson, 180 Colo. 288, 505 P.2d 1 (1973).</T>
   <P></P>
   <T>The burden is upon the accused to come forward with clear and convincing
proof that he was not in the demanding state at the time of the crime charged
or that he was not the fugitive from justice named in the extradition papers,
in order to overcome the presumption which attaches to the governor's warrant
that the accused was in the demanding state at the time of the crime. Luker
v. Koch, 176 Colo. 75, 489 P.2d 191 (1971).</T>
   <P></P>
   <T>Absence from the demanding state is a defense which may be raised and
proven by a petitioner in order to defeat extradition. Luker v. Koch, 176
Colo. 75, 489 P.2d 191 (1971).</T>
   <P></P>
   <T>A habeas corpus petitioner charged as an out-of-state fugitive, not the
sheriff-respondent, has the burden of going forward with clear and convincing
evidence to prove that he was not in the demanding state at the time of the
crime or that he is not the individual named in the extradition papers. Ede
v. Bray, 178 Colo. 99, 495 P.2d 1139 (1972).</T>
   <P></P>
   <T>The burden is on the accused to show by clear and satisfactory evidence
that he was not present if he is to overcome the presumption created by the
warrant which governor of Colorado issues that the accused is in the demanding
state at the time the offense was committed. Eathorne v. Nelson, 180 Colo. 288,
505 P.2d 1 (1973).</T>
   <P></P>
   <T>
    <B>Or that he had not left the state.</B> To demonstrate that he was not a
fugitive from justice, the defendant would have to show either that he was not
present in the state demanding extradition at the time that the crime allegedly
was committed, or that he had not left the state. Fox v. People, 161 Colo. 163,
420 P.2d 412 (1966).</T>
   <P></P>
   <T>The presumption raised by a governor's warrant in an asylum state in a habeas

    <B>Failure of sheriff to make formal return to writ not prejudicial.</B>
While the better and approved practice is for a sheriff to make a formal
return to a writ of habeas corpus in an extradition matter, where all
extradition documents were before the trial court and the validity of the
detention was determined without objection that such formal return had not
been filed, and the substantial rights of the petitioner were not adversely
affected thereby, he cannot be heard to complain for the first time in the
supreme court that no formal return was made. Bright v. Foster, 150 Colo.

district attorney failed to answer all interrogatories served upon him by a habeas

keeping. The officer or agent of a demanding state to whom a prisoner

any county or city through which he may pass. The keeper of the jail must
receive and safely keep the prisoner until the officer or agent having
charge of him is ready to proceed on his route, such officer or agent,
however, being chargeable with the expense of keeping; but the
officer or agent shall produce and show to the keeper of the jail
satisfactory written evidence of the fact that he is actually transporting
such prisoner to the demanding state after a requisition by the executive

When a person has been arrested prior to requisition for a crime in

conditioned upon his appearance at the time specified for his
surrender upon the warrant of the governor of this state for his

    <B>Unnecessary to rearrest upon filing of governor's warrant.</B>
The clear meaning and purport of this section is that when a person
has been arrested prior to requisition in accordance with §
16-19-114 and is thereafter admitted to bail, the bond being returnable
on a specified date, it is unnecessary to rearrest such person upon
the issuance and filing in court of the governor's warrant.
Appearance on the day specified constitutes surrender upon the governor's
warrant. McClearn v. Jones, 162 Colo. 354, 426 P.2d 192 (1967).</T>

    <B>No right to bail exists after governor's warrant has been served</B> and
pending decision on a habeas corpus petition in the trial court because,
where the fugitive is being held for another state, he should be readily
available to be turned over to those who arrive to return him. A special
obligation to deliver a fugitive is owed to a sister state -- an obligation
which makes bail inappropriate after the stage when issuance of the governor's
warrant is reached. Johnson v. District Court, 199 Colo. 458, 610 P.2d 1064 (1980).</T>
   <P></P>

    <B>Legislative intent to deny bail after service of warrant.</B>
The lack of an absolute right to bail after service of the governor's warrant
does not mean that the court has lost its inherent power to grant bail after
that time, but simply reflects a determination that the legislative intent
to deny bail after service of the governor's warrant is a reasonable and
appropriate limitation on that power absent the most extraordinary circumstances.

(1)<M>In all cases where complaint is made against any fugitive from
justice, the judge or justice in his discretion may require from
complainant good and sufficient security for the payment of all costs
which may accrue from the arrest and detention of such fugitive, which
security shall be by bond to the clerk of the district court, conditioned
for the payment of costs, which bond, together with a statement of the
costs which have accrued on the examination, shall be returned to the
office of the clerk of the district court. Upon the determination of the
proceedings against the fugitive within that county, the clerk shall issue
a fee bill as in other cases, to be served on the persons named in the
bond, or any of them, which fee bill shall be served and returned by the
sheriff, for which he shall be allowed the same fees as are given him for
serving notices. If the fees are not paid on or before the first day of the
next district court to be held in and for that county, nor any cause then
shown why they should not be paid, the clerk may issue an execution for the
same against those parties on whom the fee bill has been served and when
the fees are collected shall pay over the same to the persons respectively
entitled thereto. The clerk shall be entitled to one dollar for his trouble
in each case, besides the usual taxed fees which are allowed in other cases
for like services. Nothing contained in this section shall prevent the
clerk from instituting suits on said bonds in the ordinary mode of judicial
proceedings, if he deems it proper. The costs which may accrue from the
arrest and detention of such fugitive, as described in this section, shall
include any reasonable and necessary costs incurred by the district attorney
which are directly the result of the prosecution of such fugitive from justice.
When such costs are recovered by the clerk, such costs shall be remitted to
the office of the district attorney which incurred such costs.</M>

(1)<M>The general assembly hereby finds and determines that, since 1974, there have
been proposals for an automated criminal justice information system that shares and
tracks data concerning offenders among the various criminal justice agencies. Because
each of the criminal justice agencies in the state has developed independent information
systems to address each agency's own management and planning needs, the status of
criminal justice information in the state has been fragmented.</M>

purpose of developing, operating, supporting, maintaining, and enhancing, in a
cost-effective manner, a seamless, integrated criminal justice information system that
maximizes standardization of data and communications technology among law
enforcement agencies, district attorneys, the courts, and state-funded corrections for adult
and youth offenders and other agencies as approved by the general assembly or by the
executive board pursuant to this article. Such a system will improve:</M>

    <B>Annotator's note.</B>
Since § 16-22-102 is similar to § 18-3-412.5 as it existed prior to its 2002
repeal
and reenactment, a relevant case construing that provision has been included in the
annotations to this section.</T>
   <P></P>
   <T>
    <B>The sex offender registration act taken as a whole gives fair notice that
"residence" applies to more than a traditional house or apartment, so it is not
unconstitutionally vague as applied to defendant.</B> Defendant had fair notice that
staying in his car may have triggered his registration duties. People v. Allman, 2012
COA
212, 321 P.3d 557.</T>
   <P></P>
   <T>
    <B>In reference to the term "convicted" in subsection (3), the phrase "having
received a deferred judgment and sentence" does not mean the same as "completing the
terms of a deferred sentencing agreement".</B> Defendant must register as a sex
offender pursuant to § 16-22-103 (1)(a) despite completion of a deferred sentencing
agreement. Dubois v. Abrahamson, 214 P.3d 586 (Colo. App. 2009).</T>
   <P></P>
   <T>
    <B>A motor vehicle if used, intended to be used, or usually used for habitation may
be a "residence", even if it is not parked in a fixed location.</B> People v. Allman, 2012
COA 212, 321 P.3d 557.</T>
   <P></P>
   <T>
    <B>The term "residence" does not require an address.</B> People v. Allman, 2012
COA 212, 321 P.3d 557.</T>
   <P></P>
   <T>
    <B>The trial court properly ordered the defendant to register as a sex offender
pursuant
to this section even though defendant plead guilty to an offense not specifically listed in
the
definition of "unlawful sexual behavior" in subsection (1)(b).</B> Although defendant
plead
guilty to contributing to the delinquency of a minor, she had engaged in soliciting for
child
prostitution, pandering of a child, procurement of a child for sexual exploitation, and
inducement of child prostitution. Thus, the factual basis for the plea involved unlawful
sexual behavior, and defendant was appropriately required to register as a sex offender.
People v. Meidinger, 987 P.2d 937 (Colo. App. 1999).</T>
   <P></P>
   <T>
    <B>To establish a residence under subsection (5.7)</B> requires a physical presence
or occupancy at a location. An offender under the Colorado Sex Offender Registration
Act is required to give notice of where he or she intends to reside upon release from
custody, but is not required to register at an address solely based upon that intent. People
v. Griffin, 397 P.3d 1086 (Colo. App. 2011), cert. dismissed, 2014 CO 48, 328 P.3d 91.</T>

the
manner specified in section 16-22-108, so long as the person is a temporary or permanent
resident of Colorado. The person may petition the court for an order to discontinue the
requirement for registration in this state at the times specified in section 16-22-113 for
offense classifications that are comparable to the classification of the offense for which
the person was convicted in the other state or jurisdiction. The person may petition the

the requirements for registration in Colorado, as set forth in section 16-22-108, and is
therefore not required to petition the court for removal from the Colorado sex offender
registry pursuant to section 16-22-113.</M>

of any act that may constitute unlawful sexual behavior; except that, with respect to
section 16-22-113 (1)(a) to (1)(e), a person who is adjudicated or receives a disposition
as
a juvenile may petition the court for an order to discontinue the duty to register as
provided in those subsections, but only if the person has not subsequently been convicted
as an adult of any offense involving unlawful sexual behavior or convicted as an adult of
another offense, the underlying factual basis of which involves unlawful sexual behavior.
In addition, the duty to provide notice to a person of the duty to register, as set forth in
sections 16-22-105 to 16-22-107, applies to juvenile parole and probation officers and
appropriate personnel of the division of youth services in the department of human
services. If a person is required to register pursuant to this article 22 due to an
adjudication or disposition as a juvenile, the duty to register automatically terminates
either when the person reaches twenty-five years of age or seven years from the date the
juvenile was required to register, whichever occurs later.</M>

pursuant to a motion filed by a person described in this subsection (5) or on its own
motion, a court determines that exempting the person from the registration requirement
would not pose a significant risk to the community, the court, upon consideration of the
totality of the circumstances, may exempt the person from the registration requirements
imposed pursuant to this section if:</M>
  </T>
  <P N="(5)(a)(I)"></P>

unlawful sexual behavior or another offense, the underlying factual basis of which

  <T>(IV)<M>The person has received an evaluation that conforms with the standards
developed pursuant to section 16-11.7-103 (4)(i) from an evaluator who meets the
standards established by the sex offender management board, and the evaluator
recommends exempting the person from the registration requirements based upon the
best
interests of that person and the community; and</M>

  <T>(IV.5)<M>The court has considered a written or oral statement by the victim of the

prosecution for the offense of failure to register as a sex offender, as described in section
18-3-412.5, C.R.S. Failure of any governmental entity or any employee of any
governmental entity to comply with any requirement of this article shall not constitute a
defense to the offense of failure to register as a sex offender if there is evidence that the

    <B>Annotator's note.</B>
Since § 16-22-103 is similar to § 18-3-412.5 as it existed prior to its 2002
repeal
and reenactment, relevant cases construing that provision have been included in the
annotations to this section.</T>
   <P></P>
   <T>
    <B>Prior to the 2004 amendment, subsection (1)(c)</B> referred to the department
of corrections in Colorado not that of any other state. Fendley v. People, 107 P.3d 1122
(Colo. App. 2004).</T>
   <P></P>
   <T>
    <B>Use of present tense in subsection (3) refers to any person currently required to
register</B> in the state of conviction of the sexual offense and not to a person who
"was" or "has been" required to register. Fendley v. People, 107 P.3d 1122 (Colo. App.
2004).</T>
   <P></P>
   <T>
    <B>Although application of subsection (1) relates back to convicted sexual
offenders
released on or after July 1, 1991, it does not violate the prohibition against ex post facto
laws, because the statute does not disadvantage the offender.</B> The registration
requirement is intended to assist law enforcement officials in investigating future sex
crimes
and to protect the public safety. As such, it is remedial, not punitive, and does not
unconstitutionally enhance the offender's punishment. Jamison v. People, 988 P.2d 177
(Colo. App. 1999); People v. Sowell, 327 P.3d 273 (Colo. App. 2011).</T>
   <P></P>
   <T>
    <B>The 2008 amendments to subsection (2)(d)(I) were substantive and cannot be
applied retroactively.</B> A retroactive application would modify vested rights and
liabilities. Vondra v. Colo. Dept. of Corr., 226 P.3d 1165 (Colo. App. 2009).</T>
   <P></P>
   <T>
    <B>Procedural due process does not entitle a sex offender to a hearing on the sex
offender's dangerousness before requiring the sex offender to register.</B> Due process
does not guarantee the right to a hearing to establish a fact that is not material under the
statute. Dangerousness is not material under the registration statute, the duty to register
is triggered by a conviction of a sex offense. The statute even states the crime for which
the registrant was convicted may not reflect the current level of dangerousness. People
ex rel. C.B.B., 75 P.3d 1148 (Colo. App. 2003).</T>
   <P></P>
   <T>
    <B>Procedural due process does not entitle a juvenile sex offender to present
evidence or to be heard regarding his or her potential for rehabilitation.</B> Defendant's
potential for rehabilitation is irrelevant to the sex offender registration requirement;
defendant was required to register as a sex offender based on his adjudication for the
current offense coupled with having a prior adjudication for a sex offense. People in
Interest of C.M.D., 2018 COA 172, 452 P.3d 133.</T>
   <P></P>
   <T>
    <B>The sex offender registration act does not deprive juveniles of their liberty or
privacy interests.</B> Defendant's substantive due process claim that registration
deprives juveniles of their liberty interests in living, associating with families and friends,
and circulating in society does not implicate a fundamental right and the act's stated
purpose of protecting the public is rational. Juvenile defendant's privacy rights are not
violated because juveniles do not necessarily have greater privacy rights than adults and
internet posting required by the act is limited to certain adults. People in Interest of
C.M.D., 2018 COA 172, 452 P.3d 133.</T>
   <P></P>
   <T>
    <B>This section does not violate the offender's right to equal protection even though
this
section does not apply to persons who may have been convicted the same date as the
offender, but were eligible for release prior to 1991.</B> The offender is not similarly
situated to persons released prior to 1991 because the offender was not eligible for
release
as of said date. Jamison v. People, 988 P.2d 177 (Colo. App. 1999).</T>
   <P></P>
   <T>
    <B>Because sex offender registration is not punishment, requiring a juvenile to
register does not violate cruel and unusual punishment</B> even though juveniles are
constitutionally different from adults when it comes to sentencing. People in Interest of
J.O., 2015 COA 119, 383 P.3d 69; People in Interest of C.M.D., 2018 COA 172, 452
P.3d 133.</T>
   <P></P>
   <T>
    <B>The requirement for lifetime registration on the sex offender registry for
twice-adjudicated juveniles constitutes punishment for purposes of an eighth amendment
"cruel and unusual punishment" analysis.</B> People in Interest of T.B., 2019 COA 89,
-- P.3d --.</T>
   <P></P>
   <T>Analyzing any statute under the eighth amendment involves a two-part inquiry: (1) Is
the registration requirement a "punishment", and, if so, (2) is it "cruel and unusual"?
People in Interest of T.B., 2019 COA 89, -- P.3d --.</T>
   <P></P>
   <T>With regard to the first inquiry, requiring a juvenile, even one who has been twice
adjudicated for offenses involving unlawful sexual behavior, to register as a sex offender
for life without regard for whether he or she poses a risk to public safety is an overly
inclusive -- and therefore excessive -- means of protecting public safety. Because the
lifetime registration requirement is not adequately tethered to the statute's stated
nonpunitive purpose, the automatic lifetime registration requirement for juvenile
offenders is excessive. And because the lifetime registration requirement is excessive in
relation to its nonpunitive purpose when applied to juveniles, it operates more like a
punishment. People in Interest of T.B., 2019 COA 89, -- P.3d --.</T>
   <P></P>
   <T>
    <B>The sex offender registration act taken as a whole gives fair notice that
"residence" applies to more than a traditional house or apartment, so it is not
unconstitutionally vague as applied to defendant.</B> Defendant had fair notice that
staying in his car may have triggered his registration duties. People v. Allman, 2012
COA
212, 321 P.3d 557.</T>
   <P></P>
   <T>
    <B>The duty to register as a sex offender is not a direct consequence of the entry of
a
guilty plea and therefore need not be included in the advisement.</B> The statutory duty
to register as a sex offender in Colorado is only a collateral consequence of a defendant's
guilty plea. Failure to advise defendant of the duty to register as a sex offender does not
invalidate his guilty plea. People v. Montaine, 7 P.3d 1065 (Colo. App. 1999).</T>
   <P></P>
   <T>
    <B>The requirement that a juvenile register as a sex offender pursuant to this section
does not give rise to a constitutional right to a jury trial</B> in a juvenile adjudication
because the statutory duty to register as a sex offender is not a criminal punishment.
People ex rel. J.T., 13 P.3d 321 (Colo. App. 2000).</T>
   <P></P>
   <T>
    <B>A person convicted of violating 18 U.S.C. § 2252 (a)(2) has engaged in
conduct that, if committed in Colorado, would constitute sexual exploitation of a child in
violation of § 18-6-403 (3)(b.5)</B> and is, therefore, subject to the registration
requirement of subsection (1)(b) of this section. Fabiano v. Armstrong, 141 P.3d 907
(Colo.
App. 2006).</T>
   <P></P>
   <T>
    <B>Based upon defendant's civil commitment in another state for a sex offense,
defendant is required to register as a sex offender in this state.</B> Defendant is a
person
"required to register in the state of conviction" and a person who would be "required to
register if convicted in this state". The civil commitment proceedings in the other state
were equivalent to a deferred judgment and sentencing in this state, thus satisfying the
"convicted" requirement of the statute. The other state's commitment procedures
included
sufficient due process protections. The crime that was the subject of the civil
commitment would essentially have been sexual assault on a child in this state. Mayo v.
People, 181 P.3d 1207 (Colo. App. 2008).</T>
   <P></P>
   <T>
    <B>A person with an out-of-state conviction for an offense comparable to sexual
assault on a child in this state is not eligible to discontinue registration with this state's
sex
offender registry</B> because a person who is convicted in this state of the same offense
is not eligible to discontinue registration. Curtiss v. People, 2014 COA 107, 410 P.3d
539.</T>
   <P></P>
   <T>
    <B>Defendant must register as a sex offender pursuant to subsection (1)(a)</B>
despite completion of a deferred sentencing agreement based on the plain language of the
definition of "convicted", as defined in § 16-22-102 (3) and as used in subsection
(1)(a) of this section. Dubois v. Abrahamson, 214 P.3d 586 (Colo. App. 2009).</T>
   <P></P>
   <T>
    <B>The phrase "as charged in the first petition filed with the court" in subsection
(5)(a)(III) means the original petition as it appeared when it was filed</B> and not any
amendments or subsequent petitions. People in Interest of I.S., 2017 COA 155, 415 P.3d
869.</T>
   <P></P>
   <T>
    <B>The first offense criterion in subsection (5)(a)(III) for exemption from sex
offender registration does not apply when a juvenile is simultaneously adjudicated</B>
for unlawful sexual contact and indecent exposure. People in Interest of J.O., 2015 COA
119, 383 P.3d 69.</T>
   <P></P>
   <T>
    <B>Defendant not required to register as a sex offender for offense committed in
another state if</B> all of the Colorado elements of the crime are not met. Because
statute included one element that the other state's statute did not, the prosecution did not
satisfy all of the elements of the crime of indecent exposure, thus defendant was not
required to register as a sex offender for a conviction of indecent exposure in another
state. People v. Brooks, 2012 COA 52, 296 P.3d 216.</T>
   <P></P>
   <T>
    <B>Sufficient competent evidence for department of corrections' hearing panel to
determine defendant to be a sex offender.</B> The panel relied on police reports and the
victim's statements to determine that defendant had subjected a victim to unwanted
sexual
contact through threats, intimidation, and physical force. Vondra v. Colo. Dept. of Corr.,
226 P.3d 1165 (Colo. App. 2009).</T>
   <P></P>
   <T>
    <B>Evidence sufficient to establish jury's finding that defendant knowingly failed to
register.</B> Defendant admitted that he knew he had to register when he established a
new address, and the evidence showed that defendant had established that residence.
People v. Allman, 2012 COA 212, 327 P.3d 273 (Colo. App. 2011).</T>
   <P></P>
   <T>
    <B>Ongoing registration obligations under this act do not satisfy the custody
requirement for a habeas corpus petition filed under 28 U.S.C. § 2254.</B> The
requirement to register under a state sex offender registration statute does not satisfy
§ 2254's condition that a petitioner be "in custody" at the time petitioner files a
habeas petition. Registration requirements are collateral consequences of conviction that
do not impose a severe restriction on an individual's freedom. Calhoun v. Colo. Attorney
Gen., 745 F.3d 1070 (10th Cir.), cert. denied, 574 U.S. 935, 135 S. Ct. 376, 190 L. Ed.

    <B>Annotator's note.</B>
Since § 16-22-105 is similar to § 18-3-412.5 as it existed prior to its 2002
repeal and reenactment, a relevant case construing that provision has been included
in the annotations to this section.</T>
   <P></P>
   <T>
    <B>The duty to register as a sex offender is not a direct consequence of the entry of
a
guilty plea and therefore need not be included in the advisement.</B> The statutory duty
to register as a sex offender in Colorado is only a collateral consequence of a defendant's
guilty plea. Failure to advise defendant of the duty to register as a sex offender does not
invalidate his guilty plea. People v. Montaine, 7 P.3d 1065 (Colo. App. 1999).</T>
   <P></P>
   <T>
    <B>To establish a residence under subsection (3)</B> requires a physical presence
or occupancy at a location. An offender under the Colorado Sex Offender Registration
Act is required to give notice of where he or she intends to reside upon release from
custody, but is not required to register at an address solely based upon that intent. People
v. Griffin, 397 P.3d 1086 (Colo. App. 2011), cert. dismissed, 2014 CO 48, 328 P.3d 91.</T>
   <P></P>
   <T>
    <B>There was sufficient evidence to support a finding that defendant intended to
establish a new residence and was present at the residence.</B> Defendant told his
parole
officer his new address was his new residence, and the parole officer observed
defendant's belongings at the residence. People v. Foster, 2013 COA 85, 364 P.3d 1149.</T>

    <B>Residency of sex offenders.</B> A municipal ordinance that effectively bans all
felony and many misdemeanor sex offenders from living within its boundaries, but draws
no distinctions based upon the nature of the offense, the treatment the offender has
received, the risk that he or she will reoffend against children, and the evaluation and
recommendations of qualified state officials, is preempted by state law. Ryals v. City of
Englewood, 962 F. Supp. 2d 1236 (D. Colo. 2013). But see Ryals v. City of Englewood,
2016 CO 8, 364 P.3d 900.</T>
   <P></P>
   <T>City ordinance that effectively bars certain sex offenders from residing within the
city
is not preempted by state law. Ryals v. City of Englewood, 2016 CO 8, 364 P.3d 900.</T>
   <P></P>
   <T>The regulation of sex offender residency is, under the present pattern of state laws, a
matter of mixed state and local concern. Ryals v. City of Englewood, 962 F. Supp. 2d
1236 (D. Colo. 2013); Ryals v. City of Englewood, 2016 CO 8, 364 P.3d 900.</T>
   <P></P>
   <T>The operational effect of the municipal ordinance impermissibly conflicts with the
application and effectuation of the state interest in the uniform treatment, management,
rehabilitation, and reintegration of sex offenders during and after state supervision. The
ordinance not only undermines the underlying policy interests that envelop the existing
state regulations, but it also operationally forbids what the state scheme allows. Ryals v.
City of Englewood, 962 F. Supp. 2d 1236 (D. Colo. 2013). But see Ryals v. City of
Englewood, 2016 CO 8, 364 P.3d 900, annotated above.</T>
   <P></P>
   <T>
    <B>Eviction, homelessness, or lack of a fixed residence do not negate requirement
to register within five days of release into community.</B> The requirement for initial
registration as a sex offender is based on number of days following release into the
community and is not tied to where an individual is living or whether that location
changed during the five-day period. People v. Wilson, 2017 COA 89, -- P.3d --.</T>
   <P></P>
   <T>
    <B>Defendant charged under former version of registration statute is properly
registered if he or she registers either on his or her birthday or the first business day
thereafter.</B> Court may not infer the intent of the general assembly by review of a
subsequent amendment to the statute, and plain meaning of prior statute allowed for
registration on either day. People v. Duncan, 109 P.3d 1044 (Colo. App. 2004) (decided
under former § 18-3-412.5 (3)(a)(I)).</T>
   <P></P>
   <T>
    <B>A violation of subsection (3)(i) of this section must be charged under the
catchall provision of § 18-3-412.5 (1), and not under § 18-3-412.5 (1)(g).</B>
If, in 2012, the general assembly had intended to broaden the meaning of §
18-3-412.5 (1)(g), it could have amended that provision to explicitly include the situation
of a sex offender who lacks a fixed residence. People v. Jones, 2017 COA 116, 405 P.3d

    <B>The intent of the Colorado Sex Offender Registration Act (SORA) registration
requirements is nonpunitive.</B> Millard v. Rankin, 265 F. Supp. 3d 1211 (D. Colo.
2017), aff'd sub nom. Millard v. Camper, 971 F.3d 1174 (10th Cir. 2020).</T>
   <P></P>
   <T>
    <B>The effects of SORA as applied to registered sex offenders do not constitute
punishment under the eighth amendment.</B> First, SORA does not resemble public
shaming. Second, SORA does not resemble banishment. Finally, the application of
SORA to the offenders does not amount to probation. Millard v. Camper, 971 F.3d 1174
(10th Cir. 2020).</T>
   <P></P>
   <T>
    <B>SORA does not promote the traditional aims of punishment.</B> Deterrent
purpose alone is not enough to render a regulatory scheme criminal in nature. Tying the
length of the reporting requirement to the nature of the offense, rather than individual
risk, does not render the registration obligation retributive. Millard v. Camper, 971 F.3d
1174 (10th Cir. 2020).</T>
   <P></P>
   <T>
    <B>SORA is rationally connected to the state's avowed regulatory purpose of public
safety.</B> Its requirements are keyed to the seriousness of the underlying sex-offense
conviction, and are thus consistent with the regulatory objective of protecting public
safety. Millard v. Camper, 971 F.3d 1174 (10th Cir. 2020).</T>
   <P></P>
   <T>
    <B>SORA is not excessive in relation to its nonpunitive purpose.</B> Millard v.
Camper, 971 F.3d 1174 (10th Cir. 2020).</T>
   <P></P>
   <T>
    <B>SORA does not violate substantive due process.</B> There is a rational
connection between it and the government's interest in public safety. The touchstone of
due process is protection of the individual against arbitrary action of government, not the
public. Millard v. Camper, 971 F.3d 1174 (10th Cir. 2020).</T>
   <P></P>
   <T>Unless registered sex offenders challenging its constitutionality connect SORA's
alleged irrebuttable presumption of re-offense to a recognized fundamental constitutional
right or explain why the presumption would be unconstitutional, the presumption does
not offend substantive due process. Millard v. Camper, 971 F.3d 1174 (10th Cir. 2020).</T>
   <P></P>
   <T>
    <B>The requirement for lifetime registration on the sex offender registry for
twice-adjudicated juveniles constitutes punishment for purposes of an eighth amendment
"cruel and unusual punishment" analysis.</B> People in Interest of T.B., 2019 COA 89,
-- P.3d --.</T>
   <P></P>
   <T>Analyzing any statute under the eighth amendment involves a two-part inquiry: (1) Is
the registration requirement a "punishment", and, if so, (2) is it "cruel and unusual"?
People in Interest of T.B., 2019 COA 89, -- P.3d --.</T>
   <P></P>
   <T>With regard to the first inquiry, requiring a juvenile, even one who has been twice
adjudicated for offenses involving unlawful sexual behavior, to register as a sex offender
for life without regard for whether he or she poses a risk to public safety is an overly
inclusive -- and therefore excessive -- means of protecting public safety. Because the
lifetime registration requirement is not adequately tethered to the statute's stated
nonpunitive purpose, the automatic lifetime registration requirement for juvenile
offenders is excessive. And because the lifetime registration requirement is excessive in
relation to its nonpunitive purpose when applied to juveniles, it operates more like a
punishment. People in Interest of T.B., 2019 COA 89, -- P.3d --.</T>
   <P></P>
   <T>
    <B>Residency of sex offenders.</B> A municipal ordinance that effectively bans all
felony and many misdemeanor sex offenders from living within its boundaries, but draws
no distinctions based upon the nature of the offense, the treatment the offender has
received, the risk that he or she will reoffend against children, and the evaluation and
recommendations of qualified state officials, is preempted by state law. Ryals v. City of
Englewood, 962 F. Supp. 2d 1236 (D. Colo. 2013). But see Ryals v. City of Englewood,
2016 CO 8, 364 P.3d 900.</T>
   <P></P>
   <T>City ordinance that effectively bars certain sex offenders from residing within the
city
is not preempted by state law. Ryals v. City of Englewood, 2016 CO 8, 364 P.3d 900.</T>
   <P></P>
   <T>The regulation of sex offender residency is, under the present pattern of state laws, a
matter of mixed state and local concern. Ryals v. City of Englewood, 962 F. Supp. 2d
1236 (D. Colo. 2013); Ryals v. City of Englewood, 2016 CO 8, 364 P.3d 900.</T>
   <P></P>
   <T>The operational effect of the municipal ordinance impermissibly conflicts with the
application and effectuation of the state interest in the uniform treatment, management,
rehabilitation, and reintegration of sex offenders during and after state supervision. The
ordinance not only undermines the underlying policy interests that envelop the existing
state regulations, but it also operationally forbids what the state scheme allows. Ryals v.
City of Englewood, 962 F. Supp. 2d 1236 (D. Colo. 2013). But see Ryals v. City of
Englewood, 2016 CO 8, 364 P.3d 900, annotated above.</T>

(1)<M>The general assembly finds that persons convicted of offenses involving
unlawful
sexual behavior have a reduced expectation of privacy because of the public's interest in
public safety. The general assembly further finds that the public must have access to
information concerning persons convicted of offenses involving unlawful sexual

that is collected pursuant to this article to allow them to adequately protect themselves
and their children from these persons. The general assembly declares, however, that, in
making this information available to the public, as provided in this section and section
16-22-110 (6), it is not the general assembly's intent that the information be used to
inflict
retribution or additional punishment on any person convicted of unlawful sexual

    <B>The intent of the Colorado Sex Offender Registration Act (SORA) registration
requirements is nonpunitive.</B> Millard v. Rankin, 265 F. Supp. 3d 1211 (D. Colo.
2017), aff'd sub nom. Millard v. Camper, 971 F.3d 1174 (10th Cir. 2020).</T>
   <P></P>
   <T>
    <B>The effects of SORA as applied to registered sex offenders do not constitute
punishment under the eighth amendment.</B> First, SORA does not resemble public
shaming. Second, SORA does not resemble banishment. Finally, the application of
SORA to the offenders does not amount to probation. Millard v. Camper, 971 F.3d 1174
(10th Cir. 2020).</T>
   <P></P>
   <T>
    <B>SORA does not promote the traditional aims of punishment.</B> Deterrent
purpose alone is not enough to render a regulatory scheme criminal in nature. Tying the
length of the reporting requirement to the nature of the offense, rather than individual
risk, does not render the registration obligation retributive. Millard v. Camper, 971 F.3d
1174 (10th Cir. 2020).</T>
   <P></P>
   <T>
    <B>SORA is rationally connected to the state's avowed regulatory purpose of public
safety.</B> Its requirements are keyed to the seriousness of the underlying sex-offense
conviction, and are thus consistent with the regulatory objective of protecting public
safety. Millard v. Camper, 971 F.3d 1174 (10th Cir. 2020).</T>
   <P></P>
   <T>
    <B>SORA is not excessive in relation to its nonpunitive purpose.</B> Millard v.
Camper, 971 F.3d 1174 (10th Cir. 2020).</T>
   <P></P>
   <T>
    <B>SORA does not violate substantive due process.</B> There is a rational
connection between it and the government's interest in public safety. The touchstone of
due process is protection of the individual against arbitrary action of government, not the
public. Millard v. Camper, 971 F.3d 1174 (10th Cir. 2020).</T>
   <P></P>
   <T>Unless registered sex offenders challenging its constitutionality connect SORA's
alleged irrebuttable presumption of re-offense to a recognized fundamental constitutional
right or explain why the presumption would be unconstitutional, the presumption does
not offend substantive due process. Millard v. Camper, 971 F.3d 1174 (10th Cir. 2020).</T>

    <B>The requirement for lifetime registration on the sex offender registry for
twice-adjudicated juveniles constitutes punishment for purposes of an eighth amendment
"cruel and unusual punishment" analysis.</B> People in Interest of T.B., 2019 COA 89,
-- P.3d --.</T>
   <P></P>
   <T>Analyzing any statute under the eighth amendment involves a two-part inquiry: (1) Is
the registration requirement a "punishment", and, if so, (2) is it "cruel and unusual"?
People in Interest of T.B., 2019 COA 89, -- P.3d --.</T>
   <P></P>
   <T>With regard to the first inquiry, requiring a juvenile, even one who has been twice
adjudicated for offenses involving unlawful sexual behavior, to register as a sex offender
for life without regard for whether he or she poses a risk to public safety is an overly
inclusive -- and therefore excessive -- means of protecting public safety. Because the
lifetime registration requirement is not adequately tethered to the statute's stated
nonpunitive purpose, the automatic lifetime registration requirement for juvenile
offenders is excessive. And because the lifetime registration requirement is excessive in
relation to its nonpunitive purpose when applied to juveniles, it operates more like a
punishment. People in Interest of T.B., 2019 COA 89, -- P.3d --.</T>

    <B>The requirement for lifetime registration on the sex offender registry for
twice-adjudicated juveniles constitutes punishment for purposes of an eighth amendment
"cruel and unusual punishment" analysis.</B> People in Interest of T.B., 2019 COA 89,
-- P.3d --.</T>
   <P></P>
   <T>Analyzing any statute under the eighth amendment involves a two-part inquiry: (1) Is
the registration requirement a "punishment", and, if so, (2) is it "cruel and unusual"?
People in Interest of T.B., 2019 COA 89, -- P.3d --.</T>
   <P></P>
   <T>With regard to the first inquiry, requiring a juvenile, even one who has been twice
adjudicated for offenses involving unlawful sexual behavior, to register as a sex offender
for life without regard for whether he or she poses a risk to public safety is an overly
inclusive -- and therefore excessive -- means of protecting public safety. Because the
lifetime registration requirement is not adequately tethered to the statute's stated
nonpunitive purpose, the automatic lifetime registration requirement for juvenile
offenders is excessive. And because the lifetime registration requirement is excessive in
relation to its nonpunitive purpose when applied to juveniles, it operates more like a
punishment. People in Interest of T.B., 2019 COA 89, -- P.3d --.</T>

   <P></P>
   <T>
    <B>Conviction on more than one charge of unlawful sexual behavior,</B> whether
adjudicated in the same case or in separate cases, renders defendant ineligible for relief
from status as a sex offender and for removal from sex offender registry. Statute

no explicit limiting language that would require "multiple convictions" to be the result of
more than one proceeding. People v. Atencio, 219 P.3d 1080 (Colo. App. 2009).</T>

   <T>
    <B>A person with an out-of-state conviction for an offense comparable to sexual
assault on a child in this state is not eligible to discontinue registration with this state's

is not eligible to discontinue registration. Curtiss v. People, 2014 COA 107, 410 P.3d
539.</T>
   <P></P>
   <T>
    <B>A person convicted of an offense outside this state that is comparable to the
offenses listed in subsection (3) is not eligible to petition for discontinuation of sex
offender registration.</B> Because defendant was convicted in another state of an
offense comparable to § 18-3-402 (1)(e), he is not eligible to discontinue his
registration requirement. Stanley v. Dist. Attorney, 2017 COA 33, 395 P.3d 1198.</T>

    <B>The language "or to the comparable requirements of any other jurisdictions in

    <B>No exception to 10-year waiting period in subsection (1)(b).</B> The fact that

interest in the DNA sample outweighed defendant's privacy interest since the sample was
