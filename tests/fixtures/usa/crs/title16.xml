  articles 2.5, 2.7, 8.5, 11.3, 11.5, 11.7, 11.8, and 11.9) were
  numbered as articles 1 to 13 of chapter 39, C.R.S. 1963. The
  provisions of those articles were repealed and reenacted in 1972,
  resulting in the addition, relocation, and elimination of

    <B>It is unnecessary at a preliminary hearing for the
    prosecution to show beyond a reasonable doubt that the
    defendant committed the crime,</B>or even the probability of
    the defendant's conviction. Instead, the trial court is
    obligated at the preliminary hearing to view the evidence in
    the light most favorable to the prosecution and the prosecution
    therefore is accorded latitude at the preliminary hearing to

  <M>Please do not discuss what you saw, said, or did during this
  procedure with any other eyewitness.</M></P>
  <P N="(3)(d)(II)">(II)
  <M>The P.O.S.T.-certified peace officer shall ask the eyewitness

  <M>Appeals.</M></CATCH-LINE>(1)
  <M>The defendant may appeal a judgment of the county court in a
  criminal action under simplified procedure to the district court
  of the county. To appeal, the defendant shall, within thirty-five
  days after the date of entry of the judgment or the denial of
  posttrial motions, whichever is later, file notice of appeal in
  the county court, post any advance costs that are required for
  the preparation of the record, and serve a copy of the notice of
  appeal upon the appellee. The defendant shall also, within such
  thirty-five days, docket the appeal in the district court and pay
  the docket fee. No motion for new trial or in arrest of judgment
  shall be required as a prerequisite to an appeal, but such
  motions may be made pursuant to applicable rule of the Colorado
  supreme court.</M>
  <P N="(2)">(2)
  <M>The notice of appeal shall state with particularity the
  alleged errors of the county court or other grounds relied upon
  for the appeal and shall include a stipulation or designation of
  the evidence and other proceedings which the appellant desires to
  have included in the record certified to the district court. If
  the appellant intends to urge upon appeal that the judgment or a
  finding or conclusion is unsupported by the evidence or is
  contrary to the evidence, the appellant shall include in the
  record a transcript of all evidence relevant to that finding or
  conclusion. The appellee shall have fourteen days after service
  upon him or her of the notice of appeal to file with the clerk of
  the county court and serve upon the appellant a designation of
  any additional parts of the transcript or record which he or she
  deems necessary. The advance cost of preparing the additional
  record shall be posted by the appellant with the clerk of the
  county court within seven days after service upon him or her of
  the appellee's designation, or the appeal will be dismissed. If
  the district court finds that any part of the additional record
  designated by the appellee was unessential to a complete
  understanding of the questions raised by the appeal, it shall
  order the appellee to reimburse the appellant for the cost
  advanced for the preparation of that part without regard to the
  outcome of the appeal.</M></P>

  <M>Upon the filing of a notice of appeal and upon the posting of

  proceed as an indigent, the clerk of the county court shall
  prepare and issue as soon as possible a record of the proceedings
  in the county court, including the summons and complaint or
  warrant, the separate complaint if any has been issued, and the
  judgment. The record shall also include a transcription or a
  joint stipulation of such part of the actual evidence and other
  proceedings as the parties designate. If the proceedings have
  been recorded electronically, the transcription of designated
  evidence and proceedings shall be prepared in the office of the
  clerk of the court, either by him or her or under his or her
  supervision, within forty-two days after the filing of the notice
  of appeal or within such additional time as may be granted by the
  county court. The clerk shall notify in writing the opposing
  parties of the completion of the record, and such parties shall
  have fourteen days within which to file objections. If none are
  received, the record shall be certified forthwith by the clerk.
  If objections are made, the parties shall be called for hearing
  and the objections settled by the county judge and the record
  then certified.</M></P>
  <P N="(4)">(4)
  <M>When the record has been duly certified and any additional

  filing.</M></P>
  <P N="(5)">(5)
  <M>A written brief setting out matters relied upon as
  constituting error and outlining any arguments to be made shall
  be filed in the district court by the appellant within twenty-one
  days after certification of the record. A copy of the appellant's
  brief shall be served upon the appellee. The appellee may file an
  answering brief within twenty-one days after such service. A
  reply brief may be filed within fourteen days after service of
  the answering brief. In the discretion of the district court, the
  time for filing briefs and answers may be extended.</M></P>
  <P N="(6)">(6)
  <M>Pending the docketing of the appeal, a stay of execution shall
  be granted by the county court upon request. If a sentence of
  imprisonment has been imposed, the defendant may be required to
  post bail, and if a fine and costs have been imposed, a deposit
  of the amount thereof or the posting of a bond for the payment
  thereof may be required by the county court. Upon a request for
  stay of execution made anytime after the docketing of the appeal,
  this action may be taken by the district court. Stays of
  execution granted by the county court or district court and, with
  the written consent of the sureties if any, bonds posted with
  such courts shall remain in effect until after final disposition
  of the appeal, unless modified by the district court.</M></P>
  <P N="(7)">(7)

  as directed by the district court, except in cases tried de novo
  by the district court or in cases in which the district court
  modifies the county court judgment, and, in such cases, the

  <M>Civil infractions - proper court for hearing - burden of proof

  <M>A county court magistrate appointed pursuant to part 5 of
  article 6 of title 13, or a county judge acting as a magistrate,
  shall conduct the hearing in a county court for the adjudication
  of a civil infraction; except that, if the charge includes a
  crime and civil infraction in the same summons and complaint, all
  charges must be made returnable before a judge or magistrate who
  has jurisdiction over the crime. The Colorado rules of criminal
  procedure apply in a case that contains both a crime and a civil
  infraction.</M>
  <P N="(2)">(2)
  <M>When a court of competent jurisdiction determines that a

  <M>In a civil infraction case, the burden of proof is on the
  people, and the magistrate shall enter judgment in favor of the
  person unless the people prove the liability of the person beyond
  a reasonable doubt. The district attorney or a district
  attorney's deputy may, but is not required to, at the district
  attorney's discretion, enter a civil infraction case for the
  purpose of attempting to negotiate a plea to a lesser offense,
  reduced penalty, or a stipulation to pretrial diversion or
  deferred judgment and sentence. The district attorney shall not
  represent the state at hearings conducted by a magistrate or a
  county judge acting as a magistrate on civil infraction matters.

  and question any witness and shall act as the fact finder at
  hearings on civil infraction matters.</M></P>

  statutory changes in 2003 to end the stratification of peace
  officers and ensure all peace officers receive a consistent level
  of statutory protection. The general assembly therefore declares,
  in order to maintain clear standards and consistent statutory
  protections for peace officers, it is necessary for the P.O.S.T.

  for the group or for a specific position, prior to the group
  seeking authorization from the general assembly for the
  status.</M>
  <P N="(2)">(2)

    § 39-2-20, C.R.S. 1963, and CSA, C. 48, § 432, relevant cases
    construing those provisions have been included in the

    <P>
    <B>Unlawful arrest is not official act.</B>If an arrest is not
    a lawful one, if it is made under a void warrant or without a
    warrant in a case where a warrant is required, or if it is not
    made in such circumstances as justify the arrest without a
    warrant, the officer is not acting in his official capacity,
    either by virtue of, or under color of, office; and they are
    merely his private or personal acts for which his sureties are
    not liable. Johnson v. Enlow, 132 Colo. 101, 286 P.2d 630
    (1955).</P>

    <P>
    <B>Authority to arrest outside territorial
    jurisdictions.</B>All Colorado police officers have the power
    to make arrests, even when outside of their territorial
    jurisdictions, when a crime has been committed in their
    presence. People v. Bloom, 195 Colo. 246, 577 P.2d 288
    (1978).</P>
    <P>
    <B>A peace officer has authority to make arrests without a
    warrant of persons</B>committing or attempting to commit
    offenses in his presence, whether the offense be a felony or a
    misdemeanor, of persons who have committed felonies out of his
    presence, of persons he has reasonable cause to believe guilty
    of a felony that has been committed, and of persons charged,
    upon reasonable cause, with having committed a felony. Johnson
    v. Enlow, 132 Colo. 101, 286 P.2d 630 (1955).</P>
    <P>An officer may make an arrest for violation of a misdemeanor
    without a warrant if the officer has probable cause or
    reasonable grounds to believe that an offense has been
    committed and probable cause or reasonable grounds to believe
    that a certain individual committed that offense. Beyer v.
    Young, 32 Colo. App. 273, 513 P.2d 1086 (1973).</P>

    <P>
    <B>Absent exigent circumstances, it is necessary to obtain
    arrest warrant</B>in order to justify entry into private home
    to make an arrest. People v. Williams, 200 Colo. 187, 613 P.2d
    879 (1980).</P>
    <P>
    <B>Even where probable cause exists.</B>Although police
    officers have probable cause to believe a suspect committed a
    crime, nevertheless they may not enter a private residence to
    effect an arrest in the absence of exigent circumstances.
    McCall v. People, 623 P.2d 397 (Colo. 1981).</P>
    <P>
    <B>Exigent circumstances encompasses compelling need for
    immediate police action.</B>The doctrine of exigent
    circumstances encompasses those situations where, due to an
    emergency, the compelling need for immediate police action
    militates against the strict adherence to the warrant
    requirement. McCall v. People, 623 P.2d 397 (Colo. 1981).</P>
    <P>
    <B>People's burden to rebut presumption of unconstitutional
    arrest without warrant.</B>An arrest without a warrant is
    presumed to have been unconstitutional, and the state has the
    burden of rebutting that presumption by showing both that the
    arrest was supported by probable cause and that it fell within
    a recognized exception to the warrant requirement. People v.
    Burns, 200 Colo. 387, 615 P.2d 686 (1980).</P>
    <P>
    <B>The lawfulness of an arrest without a warrant by state
    officers for a state offense</B>must be determined by state
    law. People v. Navran, 174 Colo. 222, 483 P.2d 228 (1971).</P>
    <P>
    <B>Remedy for violation of arrest warrant requirement</B>is the

    appeal dismissed, 439 U.S. 961, 99 S. Ct. 445, 58 L. Ed. 2d 419
    (1978).</P>
    <P>
    <B>Officer not liable for false arrest and false
    imprisonment.</B>Where police officer had both probable cause
    to believe that an offense had been committed and that the
    plaintiff was the person who had committed it, he was not
    civilly liable for false arrest and false imprisonment. Beyer
    v. Young, 32 Colo. App. 273, 513 P.2d 1086 (1973).</P>
    <P>
    <B>Failure of deputy to obtain arrest warrant was

    (1974).</P>
    <P>
    <B>Voluntary consent by occupant may constitute valid waiver of
    warrant requirement.</B>A voluntary consent by an occupant of
    premises authorizing entry by the police for the purpose of
    effecting an arrest inside the home may constitute, under
    appropriate circumstances, a valid waiver of the warrant
    requirement. McCall v. People, 623 P.2d 397 (Colo. 1981).</P>
    <P>
    <B>Entry into home by preconceived deception lacks
    consent.</B>Where entry into the home is gained by a
    preconceived deception as to purpose, consent in the
    constitutional sense is lacking. McCall v. People, 623 P.2d 397
    (Colo. 1981).</P>
    <P>
    <B>Appearance in open doorway may excuse warrant.</B>Where
    defendant was arrested while standing in the open doorway of
    his apartment, the warrant requirement was excused. People v.

    <P>
    <B>When detention by police permissible.</B>The police may
    detain and require identification of a person if they have a
    reasonable suspicion, based on objective facts, that the person
    is involved in criminal conduct. People v. Archuleta, 616 P.2d

    <ANNO-TEXT>
    <B>This section permits a police officer to arrest a person who
    has committed a crime in the officer's presence. Section
    16-2-201 does not limit that authority.</B>An officer may
    arrest when a crime occurs in his or her presence. When that
    crime is a class two petty offense, the arresting officer may,
    pursuant to § 16-2-201, either take the arrested suspect before
    a judge or release the suspect after issuing a penalty
    assessment. Police compliance with both statutes is achieved
    because, even though they conduct a full custodial arrest and
    search, police "may" still release the offender without taking
    him before a judge. A custodial arrest and a discretionary
    release are not mutually exclusive under § 16-2-201. People v.
    Triantos, 55 P.3d 131 (Colo. 2002). 
    <P>
    <B>Arrest not limited to where crime has in fact been
    committed.</B>The theory that under this section a lawful
    arrest without a warrant cannot be made unless a crime has in
    fact been committed and that the person arrested committed it
    is without merit. Van Camp v. Gray, 440 F.2d 777 (10th Cir.
    1971).</P>
    <P>
    <B>However, a court must determine whether</B>the facts
    available to a reasonably cautious officer at the moment of
    arrest would warrant his belief that an offense has been or is
    being committed. People v. Navran, 174 Colo. 222, 483 P.2d 228
    (1971).</P>
    <P>
    <B>Warrant is unnecessary where breach of peace
    witnessed.</B>Schindelar v. Michaud, 411 F.2d 80 (10th Cir.),
    cert. denied, 396 U.S. 956, 90 S. Ct. 426, 24 L. Ed. 2d 420

    <AN-SUB>C.
    <M>Probable Cause.</M></AN-SUB>
    <ANNO-TEXT>
    <B>This section permits warrantless arrests</B>by an officer
    when a criminal offense had in fact been committed and the
    officer had reasonable grounds for believing the person to be
    arrested had committed the offense. People v. Nanes, 174 Colo.
    294, 483 P.2d 958 (1971); People v. Pickett, 194 Colo. 178, 571
    P.2d 1078 (1977); People v. Saars, 196 Colo. 294, 584 P.2d 622
    (1978). 
    <P>
    <B>And such is "constitutional".</B>This section, which
    authorizes an officer to make an arrest without a warrant when
    a criminal offense has in fact been committed and he has
    reasonable grounds for believing that the person to be arrested
    has committed it, is consonant with the case law of the United
    States supreme court and the supreme court of Colorado. People
    v. Nelson, 172 Colo. 456, 474 P.2d 158 (1970).</P>
    <P>
    <B>The terms "probable cause" and "reasonable grounds" are
    substantially equivalent in meaning.</B>Gonzales v. People, 156
    Colo. 252, 398 P.2d 236, cert. denied, 381 U.S. 945, 85 S. Ct.
    1788, 14 L. Ed. 2d 709 (1965); People v. Bueno, 173 Colo. 69,
    475 P.2d 702 (1970); People v. Nanes, 174 Colo. 294, 483 P.2d
    958 (1971); Glass v. People, 177 Colo. 267, 493 P.2d 1347
    (1972).</P>
    <P>
    <B>And so this section authorizing an arrest without a warrant
    is satisfied if</B>the arresting officer has probable cause or
    reasonable grounds to believe that a crime has been committed
    and that the person arrested committed it. Van Camp v. Gray,
    440 F.2d 777 (10th Cir. 1971).</P>
    <P>For a warrantless arrest, officers must have probable cause
    to believe not only that an offense had been committed, but
    that the person to be arrested had committed it. People v.
    Boileau, 36 Colo. App. 157, 538 P.2d 484 (1975); People v.
    Hoinville, 191 Colo. 357, 553 P.2d 777 (1976).</P>
    <P>
    <B>Probable cause is the touchstone for measuring the right to
    arrest without a warrant.</B>People v. Fratus, 187 Colo. 52,
    528 P.2d 392 (1974).</P>
    <P>
    <B>And valid arrest by a peace officer must be supported by
    probable cause.</B>People v. Severson, 39 Colo. App. 95, 561
    P.2d 373 (1977).</P>
    <P>
    <B>Violation of municipal ordinance included.</B>Since the
    violation of a municipal ordinance is a criminal offense, then
    as a matter of law, where the police have reasonable ground for
    believing that defendants have committed such offense, an
    attempted arrest is altogether lawful and the police would be
    derelict in the performance of their duty if they refuse to
    act. Boyer v. Elkins, 154 Colo. 294, 390 P.2d 460, appeal
    dismissed, 379 U.S. 47, 85 S. Ct. 208, 13 L. Ed. 2d 183
    (1964).</P>
    <P>
    <B>Flight does not solely justify warrantless arrest.</B>Where
    the arresting officer knew that a burglary had been committed,
    his dispatcher had told him of the burglars' purported return,
    and when he arrived back at the scene he observed the hasty
    departure of a man who had been talking with the son-in-law,
    flight may legitimately give rise to suspicion, and evidence of
    flight may be admissible at trial to show consciousness of
    guilt, but defendant's running was not in and of itself
    sufficient to justify a warrantless arrest. People v. Bates,
    190 Colo. 291, 546 P.2d 491 (1976).</P>
    <P>
    <B>Exigent circumstances.</B>A police officer may make a
    warrantless arrest where he has probable cause to believe that
    the suspect has committed a crime and where the officer is
    confronted by exigent circumstances. People v. Boileau, 36
    Colo. App. 157, 538 P.2d 484 (1975).</P>
    <P>Exigent circumstances obviously exist when suspects are
    speeding from the scene of the crime. To require a warrant
    would impose an impracticable burden. People v. Cox, 190 Colo.
    326, 546 P.2d 956 (1976).</P>
    <P>
    <B>Exigent circumstances sufficient to justify warrantless
    arrest.</B>People v. Litsey, 192 Colo. 19, 555 P.2d 974
    (1976).</P>
    <P>
    <B>Exigent circumstances sufficient to justify warrantless
    entry into home to make arrest.</B>People v. Williams, 200
    Colo. 187, 613 P.2d 879 (1980).</P>
    <P>
    <B>Public security may outweigh warrant preference.</B>When
    immediate police action is essential to protect the public
    safety, the warrant preference expressed by this section must,
    and does, give way to the public security. People v. Henry, 195
    Colo. 309, 578 P.2d 1041, appeal dismissed, 439 U.S. 961, 99 S.
    Ct. 445, 58 L. Ed. 2d 419 (1978).</P>
    <P>
    <B>Failure to obtain arrest warrant justified whenever
    circumstances require immediate action</B>to protect the public
    safety; this includes the situation where the police are faced
    with the choice of arresting a suspect without a warrant or
    allowing him to escape. People v. Cardenas, 42 Colo. App. 61,
    592 P.2d 1348 (1979).</P>
    <P>
    <B>Fact that officers may have probable cause to arrest someone
    else is of no consequence,</B>for, where a defendant is
    arrested without a warrant, the burden of proving the existence
    of probable cause in defendant's case is on the prosecution.
    Mora v. People, 178 Colo. 279, 496 P.2d 1045 (1972).</P>
    <P>
    <B>And physical presence with others, in and of itself, does
    not provide probable cause</B>to arrest, for guilt by
    association has never been an acceptable rationale. Mora v.
    People, 178 Colo. 279, 496 P.2d 1045 (1972).</P>
    <P>The mere association with one who commits or has committed
    crimes, standing alone, does not amount to probable cause for
    arrest. People v. Crespin, 635 P.2d 918 (Colo. App. 1981).</P>
    <P>
    <B>Nor where one merely changes his direction upon seeing
    police.</B>Where officers already had one suspect in their car
    and were questioning him when defendant approached, and at a
    distance of approximately one block from unmarked police car
    hesitated, then turned and walked the other way, disappearing
    around a corner, such circumstances did not show probable cause
    to arrest, especially where there was nothing in the testimony
    of the officer to indicate that he considered defendant a
    suspect in the crime in question or a suspect in any other
    known criminal act. People v. Bueno, 173 Colo. 69, 475 P.2d 702
    (1970).</P>

    <P>The test to measure probable cause to arrest, which is based

    him, showed him the check, and told him of defendant's own
    attempt to cash it, these underlying circumstances were
    sufficient to lead a reasonable person to believe that a crime
    had been or was being committed, as they met the first prong of

    officer that the stolen check was missing by talking to the
    payee before defendant's arrest; (3) defendant was riding in
    the same car described by the informant; and (4) prior to
    arrest defendant was seen by the officer putting an envelope in
    a small paper sack. Hence, when such evidence was considered as

    failure to produce the registration, the officer had the right
    to look in the vehicle for the registration to inspect it, and
    when at this time he observed a plastic bag containing what he
    suspected was, and which turned out to be, marijuana, the

    <N></N>the purpose of the detention must be reasonable; and (3)

    <P>The first of these requirements is determined by whether

    <P>Officer's suspicion that the defendants were connected to
    the reported criminal activity held reasonable given the
    defendants' evasive actions and their proximity to the location
    of the reported burglary shortly after the officer received the
    dispatch call. People v. Mascarenas, 726 P.2d 644 (Colo. 1986);

    stopped is involved in criminal activity. People v. Sosbe, 789
    P.2d 1113 (Colo. 1990).</P>
    <P>An investigatory stop implicates a seizure that is based on
    less than probable cause and so it must be brief in duration,
    limited in scope, and narrow in purpose. People v. Tottenhoff,

    <B>Construction of § 42-2-113 inconsistent with this
    section.</B>A construction of § 42-2-113, which requires that
    drivers' licenses be displayed to peace officers upon demand,
    which would give to a police officer unlimited discretionary
    authority to stop any car at any time for any reason as long as
    he asked contemporaneously for display of a driver's license
    would be inconsistent with this section, which specifically
    limits an officer's authority to stop persons for investigation
    in the absence of probable cause to arrest. People v.
    McPherson, 191 Colo. 81, 550 P.2d 311 (1976).</P>
    <P>
    <B>Limited searches of a person for weapons during an
    investigative detention,</B>when probable cause for arrest is
    lacking, is permissible, but there must be: (1) Some reason for
    the officer to confront the citizen in the first place; (2)
    something in the circumstances, including the citizen's
    reaction to the confrontation, must give the officer reason to
    suspect that the citizen may be armed and, thus, dangerous to
    the officer or others; and (3) the search must be limited to a
    frisk directed at discovery and appropriation of weapons and
    not at evidence in general. People v. Martineau, 185 Colo. 194,
    523 P.2d 126 (1974); People v. Shackelford, 37 Colo. App. 317,
    546 P.2d 964 (1976).</P>
    <P>In determining the reasonableness of a search in the
    situation where the search is not full blown but is rather just
    a protective search for weapons, the inquiry is a dual one: (1)
    Was the officer's action justified at its inception; and (2)
    was the search reasonably related in scope to the circumstances
    which justified the interference in the first place. People v.
    Burley, 185 Colo. 224, 523 P.2d 981 (1974).</P>
    <P>So long as the officer is entitled to make a forcible stop
    and has reason to believe that the suspect is armed and
    dangerous, he may conduct a weapons search limited in scope to
    this protective purpose. People v. Burley, 185 Colo. 224, 523
    P.2d 981 (1974).</P>
    <P>Protective search for weapons is justified only when
    circumstances of an otherwise valid stop provides the officer
    with a reasonable basis to suspect person stopped may be armed
    and dangerous. People v. Ratcliff, 778 P.2d 1371 (Colo. 1989);
    People v. Sutherland, 886 P.2d 681 (Colo. 1994).</P>
    <P>
    <B>Based not on hunches and limited in scope.</B>In order to
    uphold the stop and frisk as reasonable, both the initial
    confrontation and the subsequent search must have been prompted
    by the officers' reliance on particular facts, rather than on
    inarticulable hunches, and the scope of the frisk must be
    limited to that necessary for the discovery of weapons. People
    v. Shackelford, 37 Colo. App. 317, 546 P.2d 964 (1976).</P>
    <P>
    <B>Sufficient basis for weapons search to be excepted from
    warrant requirement.</B>The reasonable apprehension of danger
    or injury to the police officers -- judged by objective
    standards -- provides a sufficient basis for a search to fall
    within the search for weapons exception to the fourth
    amendment's warrant requirement. People v. Burley, 185 Colo.
    224, 523 P.2d 981 (1974).</P>
    <P>
    <B>Based on the totality of the circumstances, the trial court
    properly denied defendant's motion to suppress evidence
    obtained during a vehicle search.</B>Trial court properly found
    that police officer had reasonable suspicion that defendant was
    engaged in drug trafficking sufficient to justify the
    investigatory stop. People v. Ramirez, 1 P.3d 233 (Colo. App.
    1999).</P>
    <P>
    <B>Even if seizure of person is unconstitutional, evidence
    abandoned prior to that seizure is not the fruit of the seizure
    and should not be suppressed.</B>People v. McClain, 149 P.3d
    787 (Colo. 2007).</P>
    <P>
    <B>Even if the totality of police officers' conduct rose to the
    level of a show of authority to constitute a
    seizure,</B>evidence abandoned prior to the seizure cannot be
    suppressed. People v. McClain, 149 P.3d 787 (Colo. 2007).</P>
    <P>
    <B>Reasonable grounds to fear suspect armed.</B>Where the
    arresting officers stopped defendant because he matched
    description of a suspect who had allegedly committed an act of
    violence, these circumstances constituted reasonable grounds to
    fear that the suspect might well be armed, and thus, be
    potentially dangerous. The officers therefore acted properly in
    initiating a pat-down search for weapons. People v.
    Shackelford, 37 Colo. App. 317, 546 P.2d 964 (1976).</P>
    <P>
    <B>Doctrine of allowing investigative stops based upon
    "reasonable cause" was extended</B>to include information
    supplied by informants' tips as well as the personal
    observations of police officers. People v. Lucero, 182 Colo.
    39, 511 P.2d 468 (1973).</P>
    <P>
    <B>Stop, search, and seizure of evidence reasonable and
    justified under circumstances even though conduct was
    compatible with innocent activity.</B>Informant told police
    there were three males in the area and that one was wearing a
    poncho and possibly carrying a rifle. When officers spotted
    three males, one wearing a poncho, they stopped them for
    questioning. People v. D.F., 933 P.2d 9 (Colo. 1997).</P>

    <B>Officers do not have to observe criminal conduct to
    corroborate anonymous tip.</B>People v. D.F., 933 P.2d 9 (Colo.
    1997).</P>
    <P>
    <B>The record revealed no circumstances which could legitimate
    the stopping of defendant's vehicle</B>as a temporary detention
    within the contemplation of this section, where the officers
    had never seen or heard of defendant before, did not even know
    if drug trafficking actually had taken place in the house under
    surveillance, and had no reason to believe the sack defendant
    carried contained drugs, and where defendant did not violate
    any traffic laws as he drove away. People v. McPherson, 191
    Colo. 81, 550 P.2d 311 (1976).</P>
    <P>
    <B>Stopping of defendant held not arrest but proper temporary
    detention in nature of field investigation.</B>People v. Cruz,

    <P>
    <B>Detention held a full-scale arrest.</B>People v. Severson,

    <P>
    <B>Discovery of evidence of crime while searching for
    weapons.</B>Where the search was limited to a frisk directed at
    the discovery and appropriation of weapons, and not to uncover
    evidence as such, evidence of a crime having thus been lawfully
    uncovered, it is competent and admissible in evidence as
    relevant proof of the charges of which defendant is accused.
    People v. Martineau, 185 Colo. 194, 523 P.2d 126 (1974).</P>
    <P>Where police officer obtained probable cause to search a
    vehicle and seize evidence in the process of making a lawful
    stop for threshold investigatory purposes, the defendant's
    motion to suppress this evidence was properly denied. People v.
    Lucero, 182 Colo. 39, 511 P.2d 468 (1973).</P>
    <P>
    <B>Police officers are entitled to conduct an investigatory
    stop of a motorist if they have reasonable suspicion that the
    motorist has committed a traffic violation.</B>Because the
    defendant had committed a traffic violation and that offense
    alone was sufficient to justify the police encounter, the trial
    court did not err in denying the defendant's motion to
    suppress. People v. Valencia-Alvarez, 101 P.3d 1112 (Colo. App.
    2004).</P>
    <P>
    <B>Trial court improperly suppressed the evidence police
    obtained after conducting an investigatory stop of the
    defendant.</B>The police had a reasonable, articulable
    suspicion to conduct an investigatory stop of the defendant
    because of ongoing criminal activity. People v.
    Reyes-Valenzuela, 2017 CO 31, 392 P.3d 520.</P>
    <P>
    <B>Discovery of evidence of crime while responding to taxicab
    driver's plea.</B>Where the search was the result of police
    responding to the plea of a taxicab driver who thought he was
    about to be robbed, but the search revealed that the defendant,
    who was the passenger, was in possession of narcotics, the
    defendant's motion to suppress was properly denied. People v.

    <P>
    <B>Seizure of heroin under plain-view doctrine held
    proper.</B>Where police officer, who had legitimately stopped
    defendant, observed what he believed to be heroin in plain view
    on seat of automobile which defendant had just exited, he could
    seize the heroin under the "plain-view doctrine". People v.
    Montoya, 185 Colo. 299, 524 P.2d 76 (1974).</P>
    <P>
    <B>Trial court properly suppressed evidence</B>seized during
    search of defendant when fact that defendant ran in opposite
    direction from companions did not satisfy constitutional
    requirement of reasonable suspicion for investigatory stop and
    scope of resulting search exceeded a pat down for weapons.
    People v. Wilson, 784 P.2d 325 (Colo. 1989).</P>
    <P>
    <B>There was no probable cause to stop defendant's
    vehicle</B>where the officer observed a crack in the windshield
    but could not recall the severity or position of the crack and
    did not issue a citation for the crack. Evidence that defendant
    was driving on a suspended license obtained as a result of the
    unwarranted stop was therefore suppressed. People v. Cerda, 819
    P.2d 502 (Colo. 1991).</P>
    <P>
    <B>Trial court properly denied motion to suppress statements
    made by the defendant between the time he was detained and the
    time he was actually placed under arrest.</B>The record
    supported a finding that the defendant was not in custody at
    the time he was detained as part of a proper investigatory
    stop, but that he was placed in custody after the arresting
    officer had probable cause for the arrest based on
    identification of the defendant by the victim and the finding
    of an outstanding warrant for the defendant's arrest. People v.

    <B>Three criteria used in determining "fresh pursuit".</B>Three
    criteria are to be utilized in analyzing what police activity

    must act without unnecessary delay; (2) the pursuit must be
    continuous and uninterrupted, but there need not be continuous
    surveillance of the suspect or uninterrupted knowledge of his
    whereabouts; and (3) the relationship between the commission of
    the offense, the commencement of the pursuit, and the
    apprehension of the suspect -- the greater the length of time,
    the less likely the police action constituted fresh pursuit.

    <ANNO-TEXT>
    <B>Purpose of section.</B>The general assembly, in enacting
    this section, intended to limit peace officers to exercising
    their arrest powers and making their law enforcement efforts
    within the territorial limits of their authority and to require
    that local peace officers be advised of, and participate in,
    the extraterritorial law enforcement activities of other peace
    officers. People v. Wolf, 635 P.2d 213 (Colo. 1981); People v.
    Florez, 680 P.2d 219 (Colo. 1984). 
    <P>
    <B>This section, by negative inference, limits peace officers'
    authority to arrest to the territorial boundaries of their
    jurisdiction</B>unless they are in fresh pursuit or are
    accompanied by officers of the jurisdiction in which the arrest
    is made. People v. Lindsey, 805 P.2d 1134 (Colo. App.
    1990).</P>
    <P>
    <B>Violations of this section are not per se violations of
    constitutionally protected rights.</B>People v. Thiret, 685
    P.2d 193 (Colo. 1984); People v. Vigil, 729 P.2d 360 (Colo.
    1986); People v. Ray, 109 P.3d 996 (Colo. App. 2004).</P>
    <P>
    <B>When this section has been violated by a peace
    officer,</B>evidence obtained as a result of the violation
    should be suppressed if the violation also infringes a
    constitutional right of the defendant, such as the right to be
    free from unreasonable searches and seizures. People v. Vigil,
    729 P.2d 360 (Colo. 1986).</P>
    <P>
    <B>An arrest in violation of the statute does not mandate
    suppression of evidence obtained therefrom</B>unless the
    violation is willful or so egregious as to violate the
    defendant's constitutional rights. People v. Lindsey, 805 P.2d
    1134 (Colo. App. 1990); People v. Loggins, 981 P.2d 630 (Colo.
    App. 1998).</P>
    <P>This section held not to require the suppression of evidence
    where police officer accompanied injured person to a hospital
    outside his jurisdiction, emergency room personnel discovered
    cocaine on the injured person, and the cocaine was delivered to
    the officer. People v. Loggins, 981 P.2d 630 (Colo. App.
    1998).</P>
    <P>Statutory violation not willful where undercover narcotics
    detective was directed by co-defendant to travel to adjacent
    county, detective did so in good faith, and failure to have
    done so could have compromised detective's cover and sting
    operation. People v. Ray, 109 P.3d 996 (Colo. App. 2004).</P>
    <P>
    <B>The departure by an officer from the scene of the crime to
    get the assistance of other officers,</B>returning 45 minutes
    later, did not constitute such a break in the chain of events
    that at the time of the ensuing arrest he would have been
    required to have had a warrant, inasmuch as an arrest
    incidental to fresh pursuit need not be immediate, recognizing
    that considerable time may be needed to procure necessary
    assistance; the peace officers had probable cause to arrest,
    acted without unreasonable delay, and thus a warrant was not
    required. Schindelar v. Michaud, 411 F.2d 80 (10th Cir.), cert.
    denied, 396 U.S. 956, 90 S. Ct. 426, 24 L. Ed. 2d 420 (1969)
    (decided under repealed § 39-14-5, C.R.S. 1963).</P>
    <P>
    <B>Where the police officer began chasing the defendant in
    Denver and remained in fresh pursuit</B>until the automobile
    was finally stopped in Aurora, his authority to partake in the
    arrest and related matters in the form of an inventory search
    existed beyond the boundaries of his original jurisdiction by
    virtue of this section. People v. Roddy, 188 Colo. 55, 532 P.2d
    958 (1975).</P>
    <P>
    <B>"Fresh pursuit" defined as in section 16-3-104.</B>Although
    the definition in § 16-3-104(1)(c) was promulgated by the
    general assembly to define "fresh pursuit" as used in that
    section, it is persuasive in defining the same term as used in
    this section. Charnes v. Arnold, 198 Colo. 362, 600 P.2d 64
    (1979).</P>
    <P>
    <B>Three criteria used in determining "fresh pursuit".</B>Three
    criteria are to be utilized in analyzing what police activity
    can be categorized as fresh pursuit. They are: (1) The police
    must act without unnecessary delay; (2) the pursuit must be
    continuous and uninterrupted, but there need not be continuous

    <B>Characterization as "fresh pursuit" not precluded even
    though officer does not follow suspect's route.</B>Where the
    police responded immediately to a call concerning a hit-and-run
    accident and promptly pursued the only lead available, the
    address of the owner of the vehicle, the fact that the officer
    did not follow the suspect's route did not preclude the
    characterization of his action as fresh pursuit. Charnes v.
    Arnold, 198 Colo. 362, 600 P.2d 64 (1979).</P>
    <P>
    <B>Execution of arrest warrant where no fresh pursuit.</B>Where
    the element of "fresh pursuit" is not present, it is immaterial
    who executes an arrest warrant provided that individuals with
    lawful authority to make an arrest are actually present at the
    scene of the arrest and participate in the arrest process.
    People v. Schultz, 200 Colo. 47, 611 P.2d 977 (1980).</P>
    <P>
    <B>Court interpreted "reasonable grounds"</B>to mean that a
    police officer in fresh pursuit can only make an
    extra-territorial warrantless arrest if, at the time the party
    crosses the boundary, the officer has "probable cause" to
    believe a crime has been committed. People v. McKay, 10 P.3d

    <P>
    <B>Unreasonable searches and seizures forbidden.</B>Section 7
    of art. II, Colo. Const., as well as the fourth and fourteenth
    amendments to the United States constitution, forbids
    unreasonable searches and seizures and further requires that
    searches and seizures be made only pursuant to a warrant based
    upon probable cause and supported by oath or affirmation.
    People v. Thompson, 185 Colo. 208, 523 P.2d 128 (1974).</P>
    <P>
    <B>Search authorized only upon showing of probable cause.</B>It
    is only upon a showing of probable cause that the legal doors
    are opened to allow the police to gain official entry into an
    individual's domain of privacy for the purpose of conducting a
    search or to make an official seizure under the constitution.
    People v. Brethauer, 174 Colo. 29, 482 P.2d 369 (1971).</P>
    <P>
    <B>Probable cause defined.</B>Probable cause exists where the
    facts and circumstances within the officers' knowledge, and of
    which they had reasonably trustworthy information, are
    sufficient in themselves to warrant a man of reasonable caution
    in the belief that an offense has been or is being committed.
    In dealing with probable cause, one deals with probabilities.
    These are not technical; they are the factual and practical
    considerations of everyday life on which reasonable and prudent
    men, not legal technicians, act. People v. Brethauer, 174 Colo.
    29, 482 P.2d 369 (1971); People v. Thompson, 185 Colo. 208, 523
    P.2d 128 (1974).</P>
    <P>Probable cause is an elusive term and is incapable of any
    precise definition which would permit a mechanical application
    under all circumstances. Flesher v. People, 174 Colo. 355, 484
    P.2d 113 (1971).</P>
    <P>
    <B>Totality of circumstances test adopted</B>for determining
    probable cause. People v. Pennebaker, 714 P.2d 904 (Colo.

    <P>
    <B>Anticipatory warrants are barred by statutory
    language</B>and identical language in Crim. P. 41 requiring
    that property to be searched for, seized, or inspected "is
    located at, in, or upon" premise, person, place, or thing to be
    searched. People v. Poirez, 904 P.2d 880 (Colo. 1995).</P>
    <P>
    <B>For evidence constituting probable cause,</B>see People v.
    Lindholm, 197 Colo. 270, 591 P.2d 1032 (1979).</P>
    <P>
    <B>Mere suspicion does not by itself constitute probable
    cause.</B>People v. Thompson, 185 Colo. 208, 523 P.2d 128
    (1974).</P>
    <P>Mere conclusory belief or suspicion by an affiant officer is
    not enough upon which to base the issuance of a search warrant.
    People v. Clavey, 187 Colo. 305, 530 P.2d 491 (1975).</P>
    <P>
    <B>Determination of probable cause is a judicial function</B>to
    be performed by the issuing magistrate, which in Colorado may
    be any judge of the supreme, district, county, superior, or
    justice of the peace court under Crim. P. 41, and is not a
    matter to be left to the discretion of a law enforcement
    officer who is employed to apprehend criminals and to bring
    before the courts for trial those who would violate the law.
    People v. Brethauer, 174 Colo. 29, 482 P.2d 369 (1971).</P>
    <P>
    <B>The role of the police officer in search warrant practice is
    limited</B>solely to providing the judge with facts and
    trustworthy information upon which he, as a neutral and
    detached judicial officer, may make a proper determination.
    People v. Brethauer, 174 Colo. 29, 482 P.2d 369 (1971).</P>
    <P>
    <B>And mere affirmance of belief or suspicion of an officer is
    not enough.</B>To hold otherwise would attach controlling
    significance to the officer's belief rather than to the
    magistrate's judicial determination. People v. Brethauer, 174
    Colo. 29, 482 P.2d 369 (1971).</P>
    <P>
    <B>Independent determination of probable cause.</B>The fact
    that the police did not request a warrant to search additional
    places likely to contain incriminating evidence is irrelevant
    to the independent determination of probable cause to search
    the place specified in the warrant. People v. Chase, 675 P.2d
    315 (Colo. 1984).</P>
    <P>
    <B>A court may sever deficient portions of a search warrant
    without invalidating the entire warrant.</B>When a warrant
    lists several locations to be searched, a court may suppress
    evidence recovered at a location for which police lacked
    probable cause but admit evidence recovered at locations for
    which probable cause was established. Under this severability
    doctrine, items that are illegally seized during the execution
    of a valid search warrant do not affect admissibility of
    evidence legally obtained while executing the warrant. People
    v. Eirish, 165 P.3d 848 (Colo. App. 2007).</P>

    <AN-DIV>II.
    <M>CONTENT AND SUFFICIENCY OF AFFIDAVIT.</M></AN-DIV>
    <ANNO-TEXT>
    <B>Affidavit need not be attached to warrant served.</B>There
    is nothing which requires that a person given a warrant must
    receive a copy of the underlying affidavit or that a copy
    thereof must be attached to the copy of the warrant which is
    served at the time of the search. People v. Papez, 652 P.2d 619
    (Colo. App. 1982). 
    <P>But documents attached to and incorporated in an affidavit
    by reference need not be sworn to separately and may thus fall
    within the four corners of the affidavit. People v. Campbell,
    678 P.2d 1035 (Colo. App. 1983).</P>
    <P>
    <B>Probable cause must be affirmed in writing.</B>The fourth
    amendment to the United States constitution requires probable
    cause supported by oath or affirmation as a condition precedent
    to the valid issuance of a search warrant. Section 7 of art.
    II, Colo. Const., is even more restrictive and provides that
    probable cause must be supported by oath or affirmation reduced
    to writing. People v. Brethauer, 174 Colo. 29, 482 P.2d 369
    (1971).</P>
    <P>Under both the fourth amendment of the United States
    constitution and § 7 of art. II, Colo. Const., no search
    warrants may issue without a showing of probable cause, which,
    under the Colorado constitution, must be affirmed in writing
    before a search warrant may issue. Flesher v. People, 174 Colo.
    355, 484 P.2d 113 (1971).</P>
    <P>A search warrant may properly issue only upon written
    affidavit establishing probable cause for the belief that the
    items sought are or will be located on the premises to be
    searched at the time at which the warrant is procured, or
    within a reasonable time thereafter. People v. Erthal, 38 Colo.
    App. 245, 556 P.2d 1228 (1976), aff'd, 194 Colo. 147, 570 P.2d
    534 (1977).</P>
    <P>
    <B>While an officer's "training and experience" may be
    considered in determining probable cause, such training and
    experience cannot substitute for an evidentiary nexus,</B>prior
    to the search, between the place to be searched and any
    criminal activity. People v. Eirish, 165 P.3d 848 (Colo. App.
    2007).</P>
    <P>
    <B>Probable cause exists</B>when an affidavit for a search
    warrant alleges sufficient facts to warrant a person of
    reasonable caution to believe that contraband or evidence of
    criminal activity is located at the place to be searched.
    People v. Delgado, 832 P.2d 971 (Colo. App. 1991).</P>
    <P>
    <B>During a controlled drug transaction, probable cause
    exists</B>to search the location to which the seller went
    before selling the drugs to the police. People v. Eirish, 165
    P.3d 848 (Colo. App. 2007).</P>
    <P>
    <B>Judge must look within the four corners of the
    affidavit</B>to determine whether there are grounds for the
    issuance of a search warrant in determining whether the
    affidavit is sufficient. People v. Brethauer, 174 Colo. 29, 482
    P.2d 369 (1971); People v. Woods, 175 Colo. 34, 485 P.2d 491
    (1971); People v. Lindholm, 197 Colo. 270, 591 P.2d 1032
    (1979); People v. Atley, 727 P.2d 376 (Colo. 1986).</P>
    <P>In determining whether an affidavit is sufficient to support
    the issuance of a search warrant, the magistrate must look only
    within the four corners of the affidavit, and verbal
    communications to the magistrate of additional supporting
    information cannot correct an affidavit which is basically
    deficient in its statement of the underlying facts and the
    circumstances relied upon. People v. Padilla, 182 Colo. 101,
    511 P.2d 480 (1973).</P>
    <P>The court is restricted to the information contained within
    the four corners of the affidavit. Thus, it cannot bolster the
    insufficient affidavit with additional information not conveyed
    to the magistrate in the application for the warrant. People v.
    Miller, 75 P.3d 1108 (Colo. 2003).</P>
    <P>
    <B>Existence of information outside affidavit is
    immaterial.</B>The fact that the police might have had
    additional information which could have provided a basis for
    the issuance of the warrant is of no consequence. People v.
    Brethauer, 174 Colo. 29, 482 P.2d 369 (1971).</P>
    <P>
    <B>Verbal communication of facts, as contrasted with written
    communication, will not suffice</B>to establish probable cause.
    People v. Padilla, 182 Colo. 101, 511 P.2d 480 (1973).</P>
    <P>
    <B>Nor will the affiant's conclusory declaration that he has
    probable cause add strength</B>to the showing made. People v.
    Padilla, 182 Colo. 101, 511 P.2d 480 (1973).</P>
    <P>
    <B>Technical requirements and elaborate specificity are not
    required</B>in the drafting of affidavits for search warrants.
    People v. Padilla, 182 Colo. 101, 511 P.2d 480 (1973).</P>
    <P>
    <B>Affidavit interpreted with common sense.</B>In interpreting
    an affidavit for a search warrant and the execution of the
    warrant, a common sense interpretation must be applied. People
    v. Del Alamo, 624 P.2d 1304 (Colo. 1981).</P>
    <P>Task of magistrate is to make practical, common-sense
    decision as to whether, given all circumstances stated in
    affidavit, there is fair probability that contraband or
    evidence of a crime will be found in a particular place. People
    v. Pennebaker, 714 P.2d 904 (Colo. 1986); People v. Atley, 727
    P.2d 376 (Colo. 1986).</P>
    <P>
    <B>Affidavit must supply underlying fact.</B>Before the issuing
    magistrate can properly perform his official function he must
    be apprised of the underlying facts and circumstances which
    show that there is probable cause to believe that proper
    grounds for the issuance of the warrant exist. If a search
    warrant is to be sustained, the Colorado supreme court must
    find that the affidavit complied with the standards set forth
    in Aguilar v. Texas (378 U.S. 108, 84 S. Ct. 1509, 12 L. Ed. 2d
    723 (1966)) and in Spinelli v. United States (393 U.S. 410, 89
    S. Ct. 584, 21 L. Ed. 2d 637 (1969)). People v. Brethauer, 174
    Colo. 29, 482 P.2d 369 (1971); People v. Lindholm, 197 Colo.
    270, 591 P.2d 1032 (1979); People v. Dailey, 639 P.2d 1068
    (Colo. 1982).</P>
    <P>The United States supreme court, in attempting to define the
    area of probable cause with certainty and to provide guidelines
    for proper investigation, has provided a two-prong test. First,
    the affidavit upon which the warrant is based must set forth
    the underlying circumstances necessary to enable an independent
    judicial determination to be made, and, second, the information
    upon which the conclusion is based must come from a reliable or
    credible source. Flesher v. People, 174 Colo. 355, 484 P.2d 113
    (1971).</P>
    <P>The affidavit for search warrant must meet the two-pronged
    test requiring that the officer establish: (1) The underlying
    circumstances from which the informant concluded that the
    narcotics were where he claimed they were, and (2) some of the
    underlying circumstances from which the officer concluded that
    the informant was credible or his information reliable. People
    v. Glaubman, 175 Colo. 41, 485 P.2d 711 (1971).</P>
    <P>The test for determining probable cause for issuance of a
    search warrant based on information provided by an unidentified
    informant is that the affidavit in support of the warrant must
    allege facts from which the issuing magistrate can
    independently determine whether there is probable cause to
    believe that illegal activity is being carried on in the place
    to be searched. People v. Ward, 181 Colo. 246, 508 P.2d 1257
    (1973).</P>
    <P>An affidavit based on information provided in large part by
    an unidentified informant must, in order to establish probable
    cause for issuance of a search warrant: (1) Allege facts from
    which the issuing magistrate could independently determine
    whether there were reasonable grounds to believe that illegal
    activity was being carried on in the place to be searched; and
    (2) set forth sufficient facts to allow the magistrate to
    determine independently if the informer is credible or the
    information reliable. People v. Harris, 182 Colo. 75, 510 P.2d
    1374 (1973); People v. Baird, 182 Colo. 284, 512 P.2d 629
    (1973); People v. Masson, 185 Colo. 65, 521 P.2d 1246
    (1974).</P>
    <P>In order to support the issuance of a search warrant the
    issuing magistrate must be apprised of sufficient underlying
    facts and circumstances, reduced to writing, under oath, from
    which he may reasonably conclude that probable cause exists for
    the issuance of the warrant. People v. Padilla, 182 Colo. 101,
    511 P.2d 480 (1973).</P>
    <P>In testing the sufficiency of affidavits in support of
    search warrants, Colorado has followed the mandate of the
    United States supreme court in applying the two-pronged
    Aguilar-Spinelli test. An affidavit which relies on information
    supplied by a confidential informant must allege sufficient
    underlying facts from which the issuing magistrate can make an
    independent determination that illegal activity is being
    carried on in the place to be searched. In addition, the
    affidavit must set forth sufficient information so that the
    magistrate can determine independently that the informant is
    credible or that his information is reliable. People v. Arnold,
    186 Colo. 372, 527 P.2d 806 (1974).</P>
    <P>The two-pronged test which emphasizes the basis upon which
    an informer's tip will provide a foundation for the issuance of
    a search warrant requires that the affidavit set forth: (1) The
    underlying circumstances necessary to enable the magistrate
    independently to judge the validity of the informant's
    conclusion, and (2) support of the affiant's claim that the
    informant was credible or his information reliable. People v.
    McGill, 187 Colo. 65, 528 P.2d 386 (1974).</P>
    <P>An issuing magistrate must be properly apprised of the
    underlying facts and circumstances which show that there is
    probable cause to believe that grounds for the issuance of a
    search warrant exist. People v. Clavey, 187 Colo. 305, 530 P.2d
    491 (1975).</P>
    <P>
    <B>Affidavit contained sufficient underlying facts.</B>Where
    the affiant states that the informant personally observed
    marijuana in the premises to be searched, this statement is
    sufficient to permit the issuing magistrate to determine
    independently that there were reasonable grounds to believe
    that illegal activity was being carried on in the place to be
    searched. People v. Harris, 182 Colo. 75, 510 P.2d 1374
    (1973).</P>
    <P>Where it appears that the informant personally saw an
    illegal narcotic on the premises, that he was given two
    marijuana cigarettes by someone on the premises on September
    20, 1972, and that he observed other illegal narcotics at the
    time he left the premises on September 20, 1972, these facts
    are sufficient to allow a magistrate to determine whether there
    was probable cause to determine presence of illegal activity.
    People v. Baird, 182 Colo. 284, 512 P.2d 629 (1973).</P>
    <P>Where informant personally observed that apartment was used
    solely to grow mushrooms and observations were consistent with
    cultivation of psilocybin mushrooms, the totality of the
    affidavit established probable cause and supported the issuance
    of a search warrant. People v. Atley, 727 P.2d 376 (Colo.
    1986).</P>
    <P>
    <B>Information contained in the affidavit established probable
    cause to search premises, when analyzed under the totality of
    the circumstances test,</B>where corroborating circumstances of
    the same license plate on the vehicle and the presence of a
    pregnant woman and small child accompanying the defendant in
    the car at the time of the arrest, and a high volume of short
    term visitors at the trailer shortly before the defendant's
    arrest for selling cocaine to an undercover officer established
    a reasonable probability that contraband or evidence of a crime
    would be found at the defendant's trailer. People v. Delgado,
    832 P.2d 971 (Colo. App. 1991).</P>
    <P>
    <B>Information regarding results of a previous search which
    were suppressed in a previous action</B>must be stricken from
    the affidavit supporting a search warrant. But the court will
    not strike down the warrant if there are sufficient facts
    remaining in the affidavit to support the issuance of the
    warrant. People v. Wilson, 819 P.2d 510 (Colo. App. 1991).</P>
    <P>
    <B>Information regarding defendant's description that was
    omitted from an affidavit for a search warrant did not render
    the affidavit substantially misleading to the judge who issued
    the warrant.</B>People v. Delgado, 832 P.2d 971 (Colo. App.
    1991).</P>
    <P>
    <B>Regardless of whether facts were omitted with a reckless
    disregard for the truth in the affidavit submitted in support
    of a search warrant, the information was not material such that
    its omission rendered the affidavit substantially misleading as
    to the existence of probable cause.</B>People v. Kerst, 181
    P.3d 1167 (Colo. 2008).</P>
    <P>
    <B>Failure to include a complete list of the indicators of
    marijuana cultivation in the affidavit</B>did not render the
    affidavit misleading where the affidavit listed the only two
    indicators of marijuana cultivation which were present in the
    office which was to be searched. People v. Wilson, 819 P.2d 510
    (Colo. App. 1991).</P>
    <P>
    <B>Identification of wrong street not dispositive of
    affidavit's efficacy.</B>Fact that the affidavit identified the
    wrong street, which was less than one block away from the
    actual location of the truck to be searched, was not
    dispositive of an affidavit's efficacy. People v. Del Alamo,
    624 P.2d 1304 (Colo. 1981).</P>
    <P>
    <B>Information in sheriff deputy's affidavit, when considered
    separately and as a whole, failed to establish a substantial
    basis for the magistrate's determination that probable cause
    existed to issue the warrant.</B>People v. Hoffman, 293 P.3d 1
    (Colo. App. 2010), rev'd on other grounds, 2012 CO 66, 289 P.3d
    24.</P>
    <P>Deputy who conducted the search and who was the same officer
    who prepared the deficient affidavit either knew or should have
    known that the warrant he obtained based on his own affidavit
    was lacking in probable cause, and thus it was objectively
    unreasonable for him to rely on it. People v. Hoffman, 293 P.3d
    1 (Colo. App. 2010), rev'd on other grounds, 2012 CO 66, 289
    P.3d 24.</P>
    <P>
    <B>Trial court erred when it concluded that (1) probable cause
    existed to issue the search warrant, and, (2) even absent
    probable cause, the officers acted in good faith in executing
    the warrant.</B>People v. Hoffman, 293 P.3d 1 (Colo. App.
    2010), rev'd on other grounds, 2012 CO 66, 289 P.3d 24.</P>
    <P>
    <B>Affidavit must support finding of probable cause as to each
    place to be searched.</B>While more than one search warrant may
    be issued on the basis of a single affidavit, the affidavit
    must support a finding of probable cause as to each separate
    warrant or each separate place to be searched. People v.
    Arnold, 181 Colo. 432, 509 P.2d 1248 (1973).</P>
    <P>Fact that the places to be searched were apartments rather
    than single-family residences does not alter the rule that an
    affidavit must support a finding of probable cause as to each
    separate place to be searched. People v. Arnold, 181 Colo. 432,
    509 P.2d 1248 (1973).</P>
    <P>
    <B>Personal observation by an informant of the objects of the
    search</B>within the place to be searched satisfied the first
    prong of the Aguilar-Spinelli test. People v. Ward, 181 Colo.
    246, 508 P.2d 1257 (1973); People v. Harris, 182 Colo. 75, 510
    P.2d 1374 (1973).</P>
    <P>The direct observations of the informant are sufficient to
    satisfy the first prong of the Aguilar-Spinelli test. People v.
    Arnold, 186 Colo. 372, 527 P.2d 806 (1974).</P>
    <P>Requirement that the affidavit for a search warrant set
    forth underlying circumstances so as to enable a magistrate to
    independently judge the validity of the informant's conclusion
    that criminal activity exists can be satisfied by the assertion
    of personal knowledge of the informant. People v. Montoya, 189
    Colo. 106, 538 P.2d 1332 (1975).</P>
    <P>
    <B>An informer need not relate to police officers the specific
    address</B>of the place in which he observed the unlawful
    activity. It is enough if the informant describes the location
    and provides the officers sufficient information so that they
    can accurately determine such address. People v. Harris, 182
    Colo. 75, 510 P.2d 1374 (1973).</P>
    <P>
    <B>Details from informant must support independent court
    determination.</B>If officer seeking the warrant is relying
    upon a tip by another person, then the information contained in
    the affidavit upon which the informant based his conclusion
    must be of sufficient detail as to permit the making of an
    independent determination by the court of the credibility of
    the informant and his information. Flesher v. People, 174 Colo.
    355, 484 P.2d 113 (1971).</P>
    <P>
    <B>Statement that informant is reliable is insufficient.</B>An
    affidavit does not establish the credibility of an informant by
    merely stating that the informant is known to be reliable. Nor
    does an affidavit establish the credibility of an informant by
    merely stating that the informant is known to be reliable based
    on past information supplied by the informer which has proved
    to be accurate. Although the words "past information" might
    conjure up in the mind of the officer some knowledge of the
    underlying circumstances from which the officer might conclude
    that the informant was reliable, the judge has not been
    apprised of such facts, and consequently, he cannot make a
    disinterested determination based upon such facts. People v.
    Brethauer, 174 Colo. 29, 482 P.2d 369 (1971).</P>
    <P>As a basis for issuing a search warrant, the mere assertion
    of reliability is not sufficient to establish an informant's
    credibility. There must be a more comprehensive statement of
    underlying facts upon which the magistrate can make an
    independent determination that the informant is credible or his
    information reliable. People v. Aragon, 187 Colo. 206, 529 P.2d
    644 (1974).</P>
    <P>An affidavit for a search warrant seeking to show an
    informant's credibility is not satisfactory by merely stating
    that the informant is reliable, or that he has supplied
    information in the past which proved to be accurate. Nor are
    irrelevant, albeit correct, details sufficient. People v.
    Montoya, 189 Colo. 106, 538 P.2d 1332 (1975).</P>
    <P>Where the only recital in the affidavit for a search warrant
    bearing upon the informant's credibility or the reliability of
    the information supplied was "That the confidential informant
    has related information to the affiant regarding several
    previous narcotics and dangerous drugs sellers and users which
    has been confirmed and proven reliable by the affiant", this
    was totally conclusory and devoid of details sufficient to
    support an independent finding of credibility or reliability.
    People v. Bowen, 189 Colo. 126, 538 P.2d 1336 (1975).</P>
    <P>An affidavit must contain sufficient facts to allow the
    magistrate to determine how the informant obtained the
    information upon which the affiant relies. Bare assertions of
    knowledge are insufficient to establish the informer's
    knowledge. Statements as to the informer's reliability must not
    be conclusory, but must contain information upon which the
    magistrate could independently determine the informant's
    veracity and reliability. People v. Pacheco, 175 P.3d 91 (Colo.
    2006).</P>
    <P>
    <B>There are at least three ways in which an affidavit might
    allow a magistrate to determine the reliability of an
    informant's information</B>so as to issue a search warrant: (1)
    By stating that the informant had previously given reliable
    information; (2) by presenting the information in detail which
    clearly manifests its reliability; and (3) by presenting facts
    which corroborate the informant's information. People v.
    Masson, 185 Colo. 65, 521 P.2d 1246 (1974).</P>
    <P>
    <B>The reliability of the informant is established if the
    information resulted in arrests.</B>The issue involved is the
    reliability of the informant; this reliability is
    satisfactorily established if the previous information led to
    arrests. People v. Arnold, 186 Colo. 372, 527 P.2d 806
    (1974).</P>
    <P>
    <B>And not in convictions.</B>To impose the more stringent
    requirement that the information led to convictions would
    impose an undue restriction on law enforcement officers. People
    v. Arnold, 186 Colo. 372, 527 P.2d 806 (1974).</P>
    <P>
    <B>Or it is asserted informant previously furnished information
    of specified criminal activity.</B>Requirement that the
    affiant-police officer support his request for a search warrant
    with information showing that the informant was credible, or
    his information was reliable, may be satisfied by an assertion
    that the informant has previously furnished solid material
    information of specified criminal activity. People v. Montoya,
    189 Colo. 106, 538 P.2d 1332 (1975).</P>
    <P>
    <B>Statement sufficient to establish informant's
    reliability.</B>Where search warrant affidavit indicated that
    previous information supplied by the informant had led to
    narcotics arrests and seizures, such statement was sufficient
    to establish the reliability of the informant. People v. Ward,
    181 Colo. 246, 508 P.2d 1257 (1973).</P>
    <P>Where the affidavit related that the informant had, within
    the past 14 months, supplied information which led to the
    arrest and conviction of an individual for possession of a
    narcotic drug, and that the informant had, within the past 24
    hours, supplied information which resulted in arrests and the
    seizure of a quantity of marijuana, this information was
    sufficient to permit the issuing magistrate to find that the
    informant was reliable. People v. Harris, 182 Colo. 75, 510
    P.2d 1374 (1973).</P>
    <P>Affidavit set forth sufficient facts to permit a
    determination that the informant was reliable and the
    information provided therewith was sufficient to justify
    issuance of a search warrant. People v. Treadway, 182 Colo.
    239, 512 P.2d 275 (1973).</P>
    <P>Where the affidavit alleged that the informant had furnished
    information which "has been the cause of approximately 20
    narcotic and dangerous drug arrests in the past year", the
    magistrate could independently conclude that the police would
    not repeatedly accept information from one who has not proven
    by experience to be reliable, and hence, the magistrate could
    determine that the informant was credible. People v. Baird, 182
    Colo. 284, 512 P.2d 629 (1973).</P>
    <P>The second prong of the Aguilar-Spinelli test is satisfied
    by the statement in the affidavit that the information was
    received from "a previously reliable confidential informant
    whose information has resulted in narcotics arrest and seizures
    on at least two past occasions". People v. Arnold, 186 Colo.
    372, 527 P.2d 806 (1974).</P>
    <P>
    <B>Informant's means of obtaining information need not be
    recited in the affidavit</B>if there is stated such detail
    given by the informant as would corroborate his assertions of
    criminal activity. Flesher v. People, 174 Colo. 355, 484 P.2d
    113 (1971).</P>
    <P>
    <B>Citizen-informer rule.</B>Colorado will follow the
    citizen-informer rule and will recognize that a citizen who is
    identified by name and address and was a witness to criminal
    activity cannot be considered on the same basis as the ordinary
    informant. People v. Glaubman, 175 Colo. 41, 485 P.2d 711
    (1971).</P>
    <P>
    <B>Affidavit need not contain statement of facts showing
    reliability of citizen-informant.</B>Where the
    citizen-informant rule applies to information contained in an
    affidavit for issuance of a search warrant, it is not necessary
    that the affidavit contain a statement of facts showing the
    reliability of the citizen-informant, as is the case when the
    informant is confidential and unidentified. People v. Schamber,
    182 Colo. 355, 513 P.2d 205 (1973).</P>
    <P>
    <B>A police officer's factual statements in an affidavit that
    are erroneous and false must be stricken</B>and may not be
    considered in determining whether the affidavit will support
    the issuance of a search warrant. People v. Malone, 175 Colo.
    31, 485 P.2d 499 (1971).</P>
    <P>
    <B>Deletion of inaccuracies not fatal if sufficient material
    facts remain.</B>Where the affidavit still contains material
    facts sufficient as a matter of law to support the issuance of
    a warrant after deletion of erroneous statements, the supreme
    court will not strike down a warrant because the affidavit is
    not completely accurate. People v. Malone, 175 Colo. 31, 485
    P.2d 499 (1971).</P>
    <P>The fact that some portions of an affidavit must be stricken
    because they are erroneous, or that a portion of the evidence
    relied on for a finding of probable cause is not properly
    recorded and may not be considered, does not require the
    issuing magistrate to ignore the other information supplied by
    the affidavit. People v. Gable, 647 P.2d 246 (Colo. App.
    1982).</P>
    <P>
    <B>Likewise, affidavit may be amended by sworn testimony before
    issuance of warrant.</B>Should the judge to whom application
    has been made for the issuance of a search warrant determine
    that the affidavit is insufficient, he can require that sworn
    testimony be offered to supplement the affidavit or can demand
    that the affidavit be amended to disclose additional facts. The
    testimony taken would have to be reduced to writing and signed
    by the witness or witnesses that offered testimony, under oath,
    to supplement the affidavit. People v. Brethauer, 174 Colo. 29,
    482 P.2d 369 (1971).</P>
    <P>
    <B>A search warrant may be based on hearsay,</B>as long as a
    substantial basis for crediting the hearsay exists. People v.
    Woods, 175 Colo. 34, 485 P.2d 491 (1971); People v. Lindholm,
    197 Colo. 270, 591 P.2d 1032 (1979).</P>
    <P>
    <B>Affidavit not insufficient though based on double
    hearsay.</B>Affidavit in support of search warrant was not
    insufficient although it was predicated upon double hearsay,
    where the information is conveyed by one police officer to
    another police officer. People v. Quintana, 183 Colo. 81, 514
    P.2d 1325 (1973).</P>
    <P>
    <B>Fruits of search supported by defective affidavit are
    inadmissible.</B>Where the affidavits were fatally defective,
    the warrants issued thereon were nullities, any search
    conducted under them was unlawful, and the fruits of such a
    search are inadmissible in evidence. People v. Brethauer, 174
    Colo. 29, 482 P.2d 369 (1971).</P>
    <P>
    <B>Affidavit did not recite sufficient facts</B>which could
    enable the court to make an independent determination that
    there is probable cause to believe that the defendants were
    keeping marijuana in their safe deposit box, where the first
    six paragraphs of the affidavit merely provide the information
    that the two college students, one of whom reportedly had
    engaged at some previous time in selling marijuana, had rented
    a safe deposit box, and paragraph seven states that the
    treasury department had received information that one of the
    defendants kept marijuana in a safe deposit box in a local
    bank, since there is no basis to test the credibility or
    reliability of the actual source of the incriminating
    information. Flesher v. People, 174 Colo. 355, 484 P.2d 113
    (1971).</P>
    <P>The affidavit is not sufficient if no explanation appears as
    to how the county sheriff's office obtained the information,
    nor did the affidavit set forth who made the observation, or
    whether the information was obtained from an eyewitness or from
    a person who received the information indirectly. People v.
    Myers, 175 Colo. 109, 485 P.2d 877 (1971).</P>
    <P>Statement in affidavit for issuance of search warrant that
    informant was present in two apartments located in the same
    building and observed marijuana did not have "plain meaning" to
    indicate that informant had seen marijuana in both apartments
    and would not support the issuance of search warrants for both
    apartments. People v. Ward, 181 Colo. 246, 508 P.2d 1257
    (1973).</P>
    <P>Although the affidavit related that the informant did
    observe marijuana and "speed" somewhere in the building at 2018
    Ogden Street, there is nothing in the affidavit to indicate
    specifically where in that multiple-occupancy structure the
    drugs were located. This being so, the affidavit failed to
    relate sufficient facts from which the issuing magistrate could
    find probable cause to believe that the marijuana and "speed"
    were located within the places to be searched, i.e., within
    each of the defendants' apartments. People v. Arnold, 181 Colo.
    432, 509 P.2d 1248 (1973).</P>
    <P>Affidavit was not sufficient to establish probable cause for
    issuance of warrant authorizing search of automobile where
    owner of automobile was suspected of selling marijuana. People
    v. Padilla, 182 Colo. 101, 511 P.2d 480 (1973).</P>
    <P>Because of the long lapse of time, the information in the
    affidavit pertaining to the probable location of the sought
    items was insufficient for the issuance of a search warrant.
    People v. Erthal, 38 Colo. App. 245, 556 P.2d 1228 (1976),
    aff'd, 194 Colo. 147, 570 P.2d 534 (1977).</P>
    <P>
    <B>Good faith basis required to challenge warrant
    affidavits.</B>As conditions to a veracity hearing testing the
    truth of averments contained in a warrant affidavit, a motion
    to suppress must be supported by one or more affidavits
    reflecting a good faith basis for the challenge and contain a
    specification of the precise statements challenged. People v.
    Dailey, 639 P.2d 1068 (Colo. 1982).</P>
    <P>
    <B>Affidavit containing stale information.</B>Where the only
    information upon which the search warrant issued had been
    obtained nearly two months prior to issuance of the warrant and
    the staleness of the information in the affidavit was not
    remedied by later information, the warrant was invalid and not
    supported by sufficient affidavit. People v. Erthal, 194 Colo.
    147, 570 P.2d 534 (1977).</P>
    <P>The warrant was not based on probable cause, and the police
    could not have reasonably relied on it, because the information
    regarding drug manufacturing at defendant's home was stale when
    the police applied for the warrant. People v. Miller, 75 P.3d
    1108 (Colo. 2003).</P>
    <P>Although crimes were perpetrated eight months prior to
    application for search warrant, because officers proceeded with
    all due diligence upon discovery of information upon which to
    base request for a search warrant, the affidavit was sufficient
    to establish probable cause. People v. Cullen, 695 P.2d 750
    (Colo. App. 1984).</P>
    <P>
    <B>Probable cause is typically lacking for issuance of a
    warrant where no relatively current information</B>of criminal
    activity or contraband at the location to be searched is
    available. People v. Miller, 75 P.3d 1108 (Colo. 2003).</P>
    <P>
    <B>Warrant issued day after probable cause established is not
    invalid.</B>A warrant issued one day after evidence
    establishing probable cause is obtained is not invalid as being
    predicated on "stale information". People v. Thrower, 670 P.2d
    1251 (Colo. App. 1983).</P>
    <P>
    <B>Trial court erred in suppressing evidence because search
    warrant lacked probable cause.</B>Magistrate's probable cause
    determination was entitled to great deference; the court failed
    to limit its review to information contained in the four
    corners of the affidavit; and the court did not give the
    affidavit the presumption of validity. People v. Cox, 2018 CO
    88, 429 P.3d 75.</P></ANNO-TEXT>

  disease if:</P>
  <P N="(2)(a)">(a)
  <M>The person committed an assault in the first degree in

    <P>
    <B>Technical perfection not required.</B>Where warrant
    specified a street address that was adjacent to defendant's

    <P>
    <B>Not every violation of this section requires suppression of
    evidence under the exclusionary rule.</B>Where search warrant
    was executed one-half block outside officers' jurisdiction, but
    city boundaries were not clear and officers promptly notified
    the proper authorities when the error was discovered, no
    violation of defendant's constitutional rights occurred. People
    v. Martinez, 898 P.2d 28 (Colo. 1995).</P>

    <B>Warrant must describe apartment unit by number or name of
    tenant.</B>When authority is desired to search a particular
    apartment or apartments within an apartment building, or a
    particular room or rooms within a multiple-occupancy structure,
    the warrant must sufficiently describe the apartment or subunit
    to be searched, either by number or other designation, or by
    the name of the tenant or occupant. People v. Alarid, 174 Colo.
    289, 483 P.2d 1331 (1971).</P>
    <P>
    <B>And description by street address is insufficient.</B>When
    the officers knew or should have known that the house was not a
    one-family residence, and the fact that the officers had notice
    of the separate dwelling facilities located in the basement is
    evident from the affidavit of an officer, the general rule as
    to multiple-occupancy structures is applicable, and a warrant
    describing the entire house by street address only, without
    reference to the particular dwelling unit or units sought to be
    searched, is constitutionally insufficient since no facts were
    presented which would show that there was probable cause to
    believe that criminal activity was occurring in both dwelling
    places. People v. Alarid, 174 Colo. 289, 483 P.2d 1331

    nor had reason to know, that they were dealing with a
    multifamily dwelling when obtaining the warrant, and providing
    that they confine the search to the area which was occupied by
    the person or persons named in the affidavit. People v. Lucero,

    <B>Burden of connecting articles not described with crime is
    upon the state.</B>When a defendant demonstrates that an
    article is not specifically described in the search warrant,
    and when it is not per se connected with criminal activity, the
    burden of showing that it is so connected falls upon the state.
    People v. Lujan, 174 Colo. 554, 484 P.2d 1238 (1971).</P>
    <P>
    <B>Failure to show connection requires their return.</B>Money
    seized belonging to the defendant must be returned, when it was
    not mentioned in the warrant and was not per se connected with
    criminal activity, when the state failed to show a nexus
    between the money seized and criminal activity, and when the
    defendant testified that the money had been lent to him by
    family members and friends to defray the cost of his daughter's
    funeral. People v. Lujan, 174 Colo. 554, 484 P.2d 1238
    (1971).</P>
    <P>
    <B>Currency was described with reasonable certainty.</B>Where
    the search warrant correctly described a $20 bill with the
    exception of the last character of the serial number which was
    illegible, the likelihood of defendant's possession of another
    bill with nine identical characters, all in the same sequential
    order, and having a different tenth character from the bill
    described in the search warrant was highly improbable, and
    hence, there was probable cause to seize the bill as there was
    reasonable certainty of description. People v. Piwtorak, 174
    Colo. 525, 484 P.2d 1227 (1971).</P>
    <P>
    <B>Effects intermingled with drugs were validly
    seized.</B>Where objection was made to the seizure of the
    particular personal effects which serve to identify the person
    or persons residing at and in control of the premises searched
    and the record indicates that these personal effects were
    intermingled with the suspected narcotics and dangerous drugs
    found on the premises, it was held that these personal effects,
    which bore the names of the defendants, were validly seized
    since these items might well serve to establish elements of the
    crimes for which defendants were charged and for which the
    search warrant was issued. People v. Piwtorak, 174 Colo. 525,
    484 P.2d 1227 (1971).</P>
    <P>
    <B>Warrant not insufficient on its face.</B>Command portion of
    search warrant which read: "you are therefore commanded to
    search forthwith the --------- above described property for the
    property described" did not render the warrant insufficient on
    its face where the property to be searched had been
    specifically described "above" two times and where the property
    to be seized likewise had been described above as
    "amphetamines, barbiturates, opium, opium derivatives, and
    other synthetic narcotics and implements used in the traffic

    <B>The link between the place to be searched and the existence
    of criminal activity or contraband is at the heart of fourth
    amendment protections.</B>Applying the exclusionary rule to
    suppress the evidence seized has the salutary effect of

    warrant current information they have available or may obtain
    to establish the link. People v. Miller, 75 P.3d 1108 (Colo.
    2003).</P>
    <P>
    <B>However, even if affidavit is insufficient to establish
    link</B>between the place to be searched and the existence of

    <P>
    <B>Whether an individual conducting a search or seizure is an
    agent of the government</B>is determined by the totality of the
    circumstances. In order to establish agency, one must show that
    the government encouraged, initiated, and instigated a search
    or seizure or that the person conducting the search acted only
    to assist law enforcement efforts. People v. Pilkington, 156
    P.3d 477 (Colo. 2007).</P>
    <P>A private actor's independent motive to investigate creates
    a strong presumption that he or she is not an agent of the

    <B>Section inapplicable to mistaken judgment of law.</B>A
    mistaken judgment of law, such as the mistaken judgment by an

    <B>Statutory good faith exception to exclusionary rule
    inapplicable</B>where mistaken information, even if true, along

    <P>
    <B>Statutory good faith exception to exclusionary rule does not
    exclude evidence that federal jurisprudence would

    <P>
    <B>Statutory good faith exception to exclusionary rule
    inapplicable</B>to evidence seized after search incident to
    arrest where arrest warrant is not supported by probable cause
    to arrest the defendant. People v. Woods, 885 P.2d 287 (Colo.
    App. 1994).</P>
    <P>
    <B>Good faith exception to exclusionary rule does not apply
    where a detective's reliance on a warrant is not objectively
    reasonable.</B>Where an affidavit contains no facts that would
    allow a reasonable officer to conclude that probable cause for
    a search exists, the illegally obtained evidence is not
    admissible under the good faith exception to the exclusionary
    rule. People v. Leftwich, 869 P.2d 1260 (Colo. 1994); People v.
    Pacheco, 175 P.3d 91 (Colo. 2006); People v. Hoffman, 293 P.3d
    1 (Colo. App. 2010), rev'd on other grounds, 2012 CO 66, 289
    P.3d 24.</P>
    <P>Information in deputy's affidavit, considered separately and
    as a whole, failed to establish a substantial basis for the
    magistrate's determination that probable cause existed to issue
    the warrant. People v. Hoffman, 293 P.3d 1 (Colo. App. 2010),
    rev'd on other grounds, 2012 CO 66, 289 P.3d 24.</P>
    <P>Because the information regarding drug manufacturing at
    defendant's home was stale when the police applied for the
    warrant, no reasonable police officer would have relied on it.
    Accordingly, the exclusionary rule operates, not the good faith
    exception to it. People v. Miller, 75 P.3d 1108 (Colo.
    2003).</P>
    <P>
    <B>Thus, good faith exception does not apply</B>when the police
    submit a defective affidavit to the county judge and continue
    to rely on that defective affidavit. Officers involved in
    obtaining and executing a search warrant have a continuing duty
    to exercise reasonable professional judgment. Even though a
    reviewing magistrate has executed the warrant, the officer must
    still read the affidavit and warrant carefully and must be
    objectively persuaded that the warrant is sufficient. People v.
    Randolph, 4 P.3d 477 (Colo. 2000).</P>
    <P>
    <B>Neither state nor federal law purports to recognize a "good
    faith" exception</B>to the exclusionary remedy for statements
    taken in violation of Miranda. People v. Mangum, 48 P.3d 568
    (Colo. 2002).</P>
    <P>
    <B>The statute creates a presumption that an officer was acting
    in good faith if he or she was acting pursuant to a
    warrant,</B>but the ultimate question must still be whether the
    officer undertook the search in the reasonable, good faith
    belief that it was proper. People v. Altman, 960 P.2d 1164
    (Colo. 1998); People v. Hagos, 250 P.3d 596 (Colo. App.
    2009).</P>
    <P>
    <B>Police must act in objective good faith when applying for a
    warrant;</B>the fact that a magistrate ultimately approved the
    warrant is not controlling. People v. Miller, 75 P.3d 1108
    (Colo. 2003).</P>
    <P>
    <B>The court is restricted to the information contained within
    the four corners of the affidavit.</B>Thus, it cannot bolster
    the insufficient affidavit with additional information not
    conveyed to the magistrate in the application for the warrant.
    People v. Miller, 75 P.3d 1108 (Colo. 2003).</P>
    <P>
    <B>Good faith exception applies</B>when police are acting in
    reasonable reliance on search warrant issued by detached and
    neutral magistrate or judge, and the warrant is later found to
    be unsupported by probable cause. Exception is applicable only
    when such reliance is "objectively reasonable". People v.
    Titus, 880 P.2d 148 (Colo. 1994).</P>
    <P>
    <B>The fact that same officer filed bare bones affidavit for
    warrant and executed warrant</B>bolsters trial court's
    conclusion that the officer's reliance on the defective
    affidavit was not objectively reasonable, and, consequently,
    the good faith exception to the exclusionary rule did not apply
    to shield the evidence obtained in the search. People v.
    Pacheco, 175 P.3d 91 (Colo. 2006).</P>
    <P>
    <B>But, it is not necessarily sufficient grounds to apply the
    exclusionary rule if same officer who filed bare bones
    affidavit for warrant also executed warrant</B>so long as the
    officer could show his or her reliance on the warrant was
    objectively reasonable. People v. Hagos, 250 P.3d 596 (Colo.
    App. 2009).</P>
    <P>
    <B>The determination by an appellate court that a warrant is
    invalid does not mean a police officer's reliance upon that
    warrant was objectively unreasonable.</B>People v. Altman, 960
    P.2d 1164 (Colo. 1998).</P>
    <P>
    <B>The fact that the affidavit details activities that are
    lawful does not cause it to be a bare bones affidavit;</B>a
    combination of otherwise lawful circumstances may well lead to
    a legitimate inference of criminal activity. People v. Altman,
    960 P.2d 1164 (Colo. 1998).</P>
    <P>
    <B>Arrest of a person other than the one named on the warrant
    does not automatically preclude application of the good faith
    mistake exception to the exclusionary rule.</B>If the police
    have reasonable grounds to believe the suspect is the intended
    arrestee and the warrant is constitutionally valid, the arrest
    of the suspect is generally valid. People v. Lewis, 813 P.2d

  urge that the testing in question was performed in good faith and

    <B>Subsection (5) is constitutional on its face.</B>Subsection
    (5), which requires a defendant to affirmatively request a
    laboratory technician's presence at trial, is an acceptable
    precondition to a defendant's exercise of his right to
    confrontation and is therefore not unconstitutional. A
    defendant's right to confrontation is not denied as he can
    preserve that right, pursuant to this section, with minimal
    effort. People v. Mojica-Simental, 73 P.3d 15 (Colo. 2003);
    People v. Martinez, 254 P.3d 1198 (Colo. App. 2011).</P>
    <P>The procedure provided in subsection (5) for ensuring the
    presence of the laboratory technician at trial does not deny
    defendant the opportunity to cross-examine the technician but
    simply requires that the defendant decide prior to trial
    whether defendant will conduct a cross-examination. Subsection
    (5) provides the opportunity for confrontation; only the timing
    of the defendant's decision is changed. Hinojos-Mendoza v.
    People, 169 P.3d 662 (Colo. 2007); People v. Martinez, 254 P.3d
    1198 (Colo. App. 2011).</P>
    <P>Burden placed on defendant by subsection (5) to request the
    presence of the person who prepared the report prior to trial
    was minimal and did not render subsection (5) facially
    unconstitutional. Hinojos-Mendoza v. People, 169 P.3d 662

    <B>Criminal laboratory reports are testimonial
    statements</B>subject to the U.S. supreme court's decision in
    Crawford v. Washington, 541 U.S. 36 (2004). Hinojos-Mendoza v.
    People, 169 P.3d 662 (Colo. 2007).</P>
    <P>The laboratory report was introduced at trial to establish
    the elements of the offense with which defendant was charged,
    and, under such circumstances, the report is testimonial in
    nature. Hinojos-Mendoza v. People, 169 P.3d 662 (Colo.
    2007).</P>
    <P>An autopsy report prepared by a doctor who was not present
    at trial should be considered testimonial under Crawford.
    Because it was reasonable for the doctor to assume the
    statements in the autopsy report would be used in a criminal
    prosecution, the statements were testimonial under Crawford.
    People v. Merritt, 2014 COA 124, 411 P.3d 102.</P>
    <P>
    <B>The plain meaning of "accomplish" in subsection (5) is "to
    execute fully: perform, achieve, fulfill",</B>thus the
    prosecution should provide the person, regardless of title, who
    was qualified and authorized to perform, and did perform, the
    tests; observed the results and interpreted them; and rendered
    expert conclusions regarding the identity of the controlled
    substances present in the sample or specimen. People v. Hill,
    228 P.3d 171 (Colo. App. 2009).</P>
    <P>
    <B>Lab supervisor's testimony satisfied the requirement of
    subsection (5) that the laboratory testing technician who
    accomplished the analysis be made available at trial,</B>even
    though the supervisor did not directly perform the screening
    and confirmation tests. The supervisor reviewed the tests,
    analyzed the instrument data, and reviewed notes of the lab
    analysts. The supervisor's review was necessary to fully
    execute the requested urinalysis because, without this review,
    the results would not have been certified as accurate and
    mailed to the police department. Therefore, the supervisor
    accomplished the analysis for purposes of subsection (5).
    Marshall v. People, 2013 CO 51, 309 P.3d 943, cert. denied, 572
    U.S. 1136, 134 S. Ct. 2661, 189 L. Ed. 2d 212 (2014).</P>
    <P>
    <B>Testimony of a forensic toxicologist who led the process of
    reviewing the test results, employed the quality control
    process, and certified the results by signing the laboratory
    report satisfied the requirement of subsection (5)</B>even
    though the toxicologist did not complete the original testing.
    The fact that the toxicologist did not hold a formal
    supervisory position at the laboratory is immaterial. People v.

    <B>Nothing in the language of this section, its history, or in
    its purpose limits the applicability of this section to
    "state-run" or "local law enforcement" laboratories as
    defendant suggests.</B>The reference to "the criminalistics
    laboratory" in this section is only a reference to the forensic
    laboratory that performed the test, the results of which are
    submitted into evidence. People v. Martinez, 254 P.3d 1198
    (Colo. App. 2011).</P>
    <P>The limited application proposed by defendant is not a
    reasonable interpretation of the statutory language. Nothing in
    the definition limits the practice of "criminalistics" to
    state-run or local law enforcement laboratories. People v.
    Martinez, 254 P.3d 1198 (Colo. App. 2011).</P>

    <B>Defendant's rights under subsection (5) not violated</B>when
    laboratory supervisor testified at trial even though she was
    not the person who analyzed defendant's blood alcohol
    concentration. Because the test results could not have been
    approved and certified without the supervisor's review,
    supervisor "performed the final and necessary step" in the
    testing process, and therefore accomplished the analysis.

    requirements does not affect the waiver of the right to
    confrontation. Defendant received sufficient notice of the

    <B>Before admitting a laboratory report pursuant to subsection
    (5), some factors the trial court might consider
    include:</B>Whether an attorney or a pro se litigant actually
    knew that he was required to notify the opposing party of his
    desire to have the witness present; the reasons why notice was
    late or was not given at all; the difficulty of acquiring the
    presence of the witness; the significance to the case of the
    report and of the testimony that would be elicited from the
    technician; and any other pertinent circumstances. People v.
    Mojica-Simental, 73 P.3d 15 (Colo. 2003).</P>
    <P>
    <B>Forensic laboratory reports are admissible in criminal
    proceedings without establishing the usual
    foundation,</B>absent a request that the technician be made
    available at trial. Testimony about the reports without
    admitting the reports into evidence does not deny defendant any
    rights to confrontation or cross-examination. People v. Moses,
    64 P.3d 904 (Colo. App. 2002).</P>
    <P>
    <B>Specific requirement in subsection (5) of this section that
    laboratory testing technician be made available at trial upon
    timely request overrides general hearsay exception of C.R.E.
    803(6).</B>When timely request had been made, trial court erred
    in admitting laboratory report without technician's testimony
    as a business record. People v. Williams, 183 P.3d 577 (Colo.
    App. 2007).</P>
    <P>
    <B>A criminalistics laboratory report may be admitted in
    evidence in a driving under the influence (DUI) trial without
    the laboratory technician's testimony</B>because there is no
    conflict with the general DUI statute, and the constitutional
    right to confrontation is not violated on its face by requiring
    the defendant to affirmatively assert such right by requesting
    the technician to testify. However, a lack of actual notice of
    the opportunity to require the technician to testify or a
    mistaken failure to request the testimony may not constitute a
    voluntary waiver of the right to confrontation. People v.
    Mojica-Simental, 73 P.3d 15 (Colo. 2003).</P>
    <P>
    <B>Court abused its discretion</B>when it committed to suppress
    results for tests that had not yet been conducted unless the
    prosecution allowed the testing to be videotaped or agreed to
    pay the cost of the defense expert to view the testing. The
    court was in no position to assess the reasonableness of future
    conduct. People v. Wartena, 156 P.3d 469 (Colo. 2007).</P>
    <P>
    <B>Court did not err in admitting the lab test through a police
    officer.</B>The defendant did not file the statutorily required
    request for the technician to testify in person, so the report
    could be introduced through another person familiar with the
    report. The officer did not provide expert testimony in
    introducing the lab test, so the admission of the report was
    appropriate. People v. Santana, 240 P.3d 302 (Colo. App. 2009),

  <M>In any capital case, the defendant may make a written motion

    16-4-101 as it existed prior to the 2013 repeal and reenactment
    of this part 1, relevant cases decided under former provisions
    similar to that section have been included in the annotations

    <P>
    <B>Purpose of bail</B>is to insure the defendant's presence at
    the time of trial and not to punish a defendant before he has
    been convicted. Lucero v. District Court, 188 Colo. 67, 532
    P.2d 955 (1975).</P>
    <P>
    <B>Proviso refers to proof of guilt.</B>The requirement in the
    constitution that capital offenses are nonbailable when "the
    proof is evident or the presumption great" simply goes to the
    proof of guilt, not to the kind of proof needed for the
    imposition of the death penalty. Corbett v. Patterson, 272 F.
    Supp. 602 (D. Colo. 1967).</P>
    <P>
    <B>Offense does not cease to be capital where death penalty may
    not be imposed.</B>Although by statute the death penalty cannot
    be imposed on the basis of only circumstantial evidence, the
    petitioner does not cease to be charged with a capital offense
    and thus become entitled to bail as a matter of right where the
    prosecution probably did not have the direct evidence necessary
    to seek the death penalty. The offense with which he was
    charged was still a capital one, even if it should later
    develop that the type of evidence adduced did not support a
    verdict imposing the death penalty. Corbett v. Patterson, 272
    F. Supp. 602 (D. Colo. 1967).</P>
    <P>
    <B>And denial of bail unaffected by constitutionality of death
    penalty.</B>The United States supreme court decision
    prohibiting imposition of death penalty in the circumstances
    then before it did not preclude denial of bail pursuant to
    state constitutional provision that bail may be denied where
    capital offense is charged when the proof is evident, or the
    presumption great, that defendant has committed the charged
    offense. People ex rel. Dunbar v. District Court, 179 Colo.
    304, 500 P.2d 358 (1972).</P>
    <P>
    <B>Standard which the constitution requires before bail may be
    denied</B>is greater than probable cause though less than that
    required for a conviction. Gladney v. District Court, 188 Colo.
    365, 535 P.2d 190 (1975).</P>
    <P>
    <B>Guilt or innocence of the accused is not the issue</B>in a
    bail hearing. Gladney v. District Court, 188 Colo. 365, 535
    P.2d 190 (1975).</P>
    <P>
    <B>Burden on prosecution to show nonbailable case.</B>If bail
    is to be denied, it is incumbent upon the prosecution to come
    forward and show that the proof is evident or the presumption
    great that the crime set forth was committed by the defendant,
    but if evidence is not presented by the prosecution, it is
    incumbent upon the court, looking to the guidelines laid down
    by statute, to set reasonable bail in compliance with the
    Colorado constitution and the eighth amendment of the
    constitution of the United States. People ex rel. Dunbar v.
    District Court, 179 Colo. 304, 500 P.2d 358 (1972).</P>
    <P>The burden is upon the prosecution to show that the
    exception to the right to bail is applicable, and only with
    that showing can the conditional freedom secured by bail
    properly be denied. Gladney v. District Court, 188 Colo. 365,
    535 P.2d 190 (1975).</P>
    <P>
    <B>Denial of bail not foreclosed by fact that defendant was
    minor.</B>The fact that defendant was 16 years of age, a minor,
    who could not be subjected to the death penalty, would not have
    foreclosed the denial of bail. Lucero v. District Court, 188
    Colo. 67, 532 P.2d 955 (1975).</P>
    <P>
    <B>Mere filing of an information or the production of evidence
    which would establish probable cause</B>that the crimes charged
    were committed will not meet the Colorado constitutional
    standard for denying bail in capital cases. Lucero v. District
    Court, 188 Colo. 67, 532 P.2d 955 (1975).</P>
    <P>
    <B>Trial judge exceeded jurisdiction but did not lose right to
    revoke or modify bail.</B>The trial judge exceeded his
    jurisdiction by equating probable cause to the Colorado
    constitutional standard for denying bail in capital cases and
    by imposing an impermissible condition on the defendant at the
    time bail was granted. However, the right of the court to
    revoke or modify bail which has been previously granted after
    notice is given to the defendant was not negated. Lucero v.
    District Court, 188 Colo. 67, 532 P.2d 955 (1975).</P>
    <P>
    <B>Only criminal defendants vested with legal rights in
    bail.</B>Statutory provisions concerning bail do not purport to
    vest any persons other than criminal defendants with any legal
    rights in the determination of the terms, amount, or conditions
    of bail. Wimberly v. Ettenberg, 194 Colo. 163, 570 P.2d 535
    (1977).</P>
    <P>
    <B>Child does not have absolute constitutional or statutory
    right to bail</B>pending adjudication of the charges filed
    against him in juvenile court. L.O.W. v. District Court, 623
    P.2d 1253 (Colo. 1981).</P>
    <P>
    <B>When juvenile detainable without bail.</B>A trial court may
    detain a juvenile without bail only after giving due weight to
    the presumption that a juvenile should be released pending a
    dispositional hearing except in narrowly defined circumstances
    where the state establishes that detention is necessary to
    protect the child from imminent harm or to protect others in
    the community from serious bodily harm which the child is
    likely to inflict. L.O.W. v. District Court, 623 P.2d 1253
    (Colo. 1981).</P>
    <P>
    <B>In the event a new trial is granted in a capital
    case,</B>the court is required to hold the defendant without
    bond until defendant requests admission to bail. Once
    requested, the court must hold a hearing to set bail, even if
    the district attorney does not contend the proof is evident or
    presumption great. People v. Blagg, 2015 CO 2, 340 P.3d
    1137.</P>

  <M>Right to bail - before conviction.</M></CATCH-LINE>(1)
  <M>Any person who is in custody, and for whom the court has not
  set bond and conditions of release pursuant to the applicable
  rule of criminal procedure, and who is not subject to the
  provisions of section 16-4-101 (5), has the right to a hearing to
  determine bond and conditions of release. A person in custody may
  also request a hearing so that bond and conditions of release can
  be set. Upon receiving the request, the judge shall notify the
  district attorney immediately of the arrested person's request,
  and the district attorney has the right to attend and advise the
  court of matters pertinent to the type of bond and conditions of
  release to be set. The judge shall also order the appropriate law
  enforcement agency having custody of the prisoner to bring him or
  her before the court forthwith, and the judge shall set bond and
  conditions of release if the offense for which the person was
  arrested is bailable. It is not a prerequisite to bail that a
  criminal charge of any kind has been filed.</M>
  <P N="(2)(a)(I)">(2)

  <M>The arresting jurisdiction shall bring an in-custody arrestee
  before a court for bond setting as soon as practicable, but no
  later than forty-eight hours after an arrestee arrives at a jail
  or holding facility. A judge, magistrate, or bond hearing officer
  shall hold a hearing with an in-custody arrestee at which the
  court shall enter an individualized bond order as soon as
  practicable, but no later than forty-eight hours after an
  arrestee arrives at a jail or holding facility. Notwithstanding
  the requirement for bond setting within forty-eight hours, it is
  not a violation of this section if a bond hearing is not held
  within forty-eight hours when the delay is caused by an emergency
  that requires the court to close or circumstances in which the
  defendant refuses to attend court, is unable to attend court due
  to a debilitating physical ailment, or is unable to proceed due
  to drug or alcohol use or mental illness. Use of audiovisual
  conferencing technology is permissible to expedite bond setting
  hearings, including prior to extradition of the defendant from
  one county to another in the state of Colorado. When high-speed
  internet access is unavailable, making audiovisual conferencing
  impossible, the court may conduct the hearing
  telephonically.</M></P>

  setting by a judge.</M></P>
  <P N="(2)(a)(III)">(III)

  on or after April 1, 2022.</M></P>
  <P N="(2)(b)(I)">(b)
  <N></N>(I)
  <M>A judge, judicial officer, or bond hearing officer shall not
  require a monetary bond to be paid in the defendant's name. Bond
  may be paid, at a minimum, by cash, money order, or cashier's
  check. If bond is paid by money order or cashier's check, the
  money order or cashier's check may be payable to the holding
  county. Before bond is posted, the sheriff shall provide the
  defendant and surety, if any, a copy of the notice described in
  subsection (2)(h)(I) of this section. When the bond is posted,
  the sheriff shall provide the defendant and surety, if any, a
  copy of the bond paperwork and information regarding the
  defendant's next court date. The individual processing the bond
  shall certify, in writing, that the payor received a copy of the
  bond paperwork, the notice described in subsection (2)(h)(I) of
  this section, and information regarding the defendant's next
  court date and shall place a copy of the certification in the
  defendant's file. Notwithstanding the provisions of this section,
  a sheriff may allow an individual to choose to stay in jail
  overnight after release when extenuating circumstances exist,
  including inclement weather, lack of transportation, or lack of
  shelter.</M></P>
  <P N="(2)(b)(II)">(II)
  <M>By January 1, 2022, each jail shall establish a means to pay
  bond online without the need for the payor to go to the jail in

  <M>The custodian of a jail shall ensure the defendant, a surety
  on behalf of the defendant, or another third party on behalf of
  the defendant is not charged more than a ten-dollar bond
  processing fee.</M></P>
  <P N="(2)(d)">(d)
  <M>The custodian of a jail shall also ensure the defendant, a
  surety on behalf of the defendant, or another third party on
  behalf of the defendant is not charged any additional transaction
  fees including kiosk fees; except that the standard credit card
  processing fee that the credit card company charges may be
  charged when a credit card is used, or, when a third-party vendor
  provides defendants the option to pay monetary bond with a credit
  card, the defendant can be required to pay up to a
  three-and-one-half percent credit card payment processing
  fee.</M></P>
  <P N="(2)(e)">(e)
  <M>Unless extraordinary circumstances exist, the custodian of a
  jail shall release a defendant who is granted a personal
  recognizance bond as soon as practicable but no later than six
  hours after the defendant is physically present in the jail.
  Unless extraordinary circumstances exist, the custodian of a jail
  shall release a defendant who is granted a cash bond as soon as
  practicable but no later than six hours after bond is set, after
  the defendant is physically present in the jail, and after the
  defendant or surety notifies the jail that the defendant or
  surety is prepared to post bond. If the custodian fails to
  release the defendant within six hours, the custodian shall
  inform the defendant and any person posting bond on behalf of the
  defendant the reason for the delay and shall document the reason
  for the delay in the defendant's file. A supervisory condition of
  release does not serve as a legal basis to continue to detain the
  defendant; except that, if the defendant is ordered released upon
  condition of being subject to electronic monitoring, the
  defendant may be held up to as long as practicable but no longer
  than twenty-four hours after the defendant is physically present
  in the jail and the defendant's bond has been posted, if such
  delay is necessary to ensure the defendant is fitted with
  electronic monitoring and the court has authorized the defendant
  to be held until the electronic monitor is fitted. If the court
  orders electronic monitoring for the protection of a specific
  individual, and the defendant is ordered to have no contact with
  that specific individual, and the judge orders that the defendant
  not be released without electronic monitoring based on finding
  that the electronic monitoring is necessary for public safety,
  then the time limits regarding release of the defendant in this
  subsection (2)(e) do not apply. However, if a defendant is held
  more than twenty-four hours after posting bond awaiting
  electronic monitoring fitting, the sheriff shall bring the
  defendant to the court the next day the court is in session and
  explain the reason for the delay.</M></P>
  <P N="(2)(f)">(f)

    -- A Summary and Recommendations for Improvement", see 22 Rocky
    Mt. L. Rev. 221 (1950). 
    <P>
    <B>Annotator's note.</B>Since § 16-4-102 is similar to §
    16-4-102 as it existed prior to the 2013 repeal and reenactment
    of this part 1, relevant cases decided under that provision and
    former provisions similar to that section have been included in
    the annotations to this section.</P>
    <P>
    <B>The power to grant bail derives not from the constitution,
    but from the common law.</B>People v. Sanders, 185 Colo. 153,
    522 P.2d 735 (1974).</P>
    <P>
    <B>The manifest policy of this section is to encourage the
    giving of bail in proper cases,</B>rather than to hold in
    custody at the state's expense persons accused of bailable
    offenses. The court should so administer cases arising under
    this statute as to give effect to this manifest policy. Allison
    v. People, 132 Colo. 156, 286 P.2d 1102 (1955).</P>
    <P>
    <B>When a trial court grants a motion for a new trial, a
    defendant is restored to the bond status that existed upon the
    filing of charges.</B>In a capital case, this requires that the
    court hold the defendant without bond until the defendant
    requests admission to bail. Once requested, the court must set
    a hearing at which the district attorney may seek to have bail
    denied because the proof is evident or presumption great. Even
    if the district attorney does not contend the proof is evident
    or presumption great, the court must hold a hearing to set
    bail. In either circumstance, because such a hearing is a
    "critical stage" as defined in § 24-4.1-302, the alleged
    victim, or the alleged victim's family if the victim is
    deceased, has the right to be present and heard at the hearing.
    People v. Blagg, 2015 CO 2, 340 P.3d 1137.</P>
    <P>
    <B>The power to fix bail cannot be delegated.</B>In the absence
    of a statute providing otherwise, the court or judicial officer
    vested with the power to fix bail cannot delegate such power to
    another. But where such power has been exercised by the proper
    court or officer, the act of taking and approving the bail bond
    is a ministerial act which may be delegated without statutory
    authority. Bottom v. People, 63 Colo. 114, 164 P. 697
    (1917).</P>
    <P>
    <B>Hearsay evidence is admissible</B>in bail hearings. Gladney
    v. District Court, 188 Colo. 365, 535 P.2d 190 (1975).</P>
    <P>But denial of bail may not be predicated upon hearsay alone,
    but such evidence may be admitted in corroboration. Gladney v.
    District Court, 188 Colo. 365, 535 P.2d 190 (1975).</P>
    <P>
    <B>Child does not have absolute constitutional or statutory
    right to bail</B>pending adjudication of the charges filed
    against him in juvenile court. L.O.W. v. District Court, 623
    P.2d 1253 (Colo. 1981).</P>
    <P>
    <B>When child detainable without bail.</B>A trial court may
    detain a juvenile without bail only after giving due weight to
    the presumption that a juvenile should be released pending a
    dispositional hearing except in narrowly defined circumstances
    where the state establishes that detention is necessary to
    protect the child from imminent harm or to protect others in
    the community from serious bodily harm which the child is
    likely to inflict. L.O.W. v. District Court, 623 P.2d 1253
    (Colo. 1981).</P>
    <P>
    <B>Probationer awaiting adjudication of a petition to revoke
    probation or a deferred judgment is subject to § 16-4-201 (bail
    after conviction) because probationer has been convicted of the
    underlying offenses that led to probation,</B>despite the fact
    that the revocation motions are based on a new charge for which
    the probationer is presumed innocent. People v. Johnson, 2017

    the annotations to this section.</P>
    <P>
    <B>The sole purpose and function of a bail bond is to produce
    the defendant in court</B>then and there to answer unto a
    certain information herein pending against him. Herbertson v.
    People, 160 Colo. 139, 415 P.2d 53 (1966).</P>
    <P>
    <B>Conditions not specified in this section are not binding
    upon the surety.</B>The condition that the principal "abide the
    order of the court" is of this character. Tanquary v. People,
    25 Colo. App. 531, 139 P. 1118 (1914).</P>
    <P>
    <B>Proper imposition of conditions.</B>The imposition of
    conditions relating to the defendant's right to remain at
    liberty on bail that comply with the constitution is in keeping
    with the recommendations of the standards for criminal justice.
    Lucero v. District Court, 188 Colo. 67, 532 P.2d 955
    (1975).</P>
    <P>
    <B>However, the trial judge imposed an improper and
    unconstitutional condition</B>where the bail order included the
    following condition: "If probable cause shall be shown to this
    court that any of the above offenses shall have been committed
    by either defendant, bond for that particular defendant shall
    be immediately terminated." However, the right of the court to
    revoke or modify bail which has been previously granted after
    notice is given to the defendant was not negated. Lucero v.
    District Court, 188 Colo. 67, 532 P.2d 955 (1975).</P>
    <P>The trial judge imposed an improper and unconstitutional
    condition where bail bond included condition that defendant
    arrested on domestic violence charges and alcohol-related
    misdemeanors and his agents could have no contact with victim.
    Although the condition was reasonably related to the statutory
    criterion that the court protect possible witnesses and victims
    from intimidation or harassment by the defendant, it also
    interfered with defendant's right to have his counsel
    effectively represent him at trial by investigating the facts
    surrounding the alleged event and preparing for trial.
    Defendant does not, however, have the right to personally
    contact the victim, her family, or witnesses. Martell v. County
    Court of Summit County, 854 P.2d 1327 (Colo. App. 1992).</P>
    <P>The trial judge erred in ordering defendant arrested on
    domestic violence charges and alcohol-related misdemeanors to
    attend counseling for abusive men as a condition of bond since
    such counseling may encourage or even require participants to
    admit their abusive behavior. Such counseling before conviction
    implicates defendant's fifth amendment privilege against
    self-incrimination and the presumption of innocence. Martell v.
    County Court of Summit County, 854 P.2d 1327 (Colo. App.
    1992).</P>
    <P>
    <B>Statute provides accelerated docket for defendants held in
    custody.</B>The plain intent of the statute is to provide for
    an accelerated docket for those defendants who are being held
    in jail pending trial as a result of the revocation of their
    prior release on bond, for certain specified reasons, or as a
    result of an increase in the amount of bond, which would cause
    them to remain in custody. People v. Olds, 656 P.2d 705 (Colo.
    1983) (disapproved in People v. Mascarenas, 706 P.2d 404 (Colo.
    1985)).</P>
    <P>By this section, the legislature meant to enhance speedy
    trial rights of those who are kept in jail due to revoked bail
    or increased bail after the issue of their guilt has been
    raised by a plea of not guilty. People v. Olds, 656 P.2d 705
    (Colo. 1983) (disapproved in People v. Mascarenas, 706 P.2d 404
    (Colo. 1985)); People v. Fields, 697 P.2d 749 (Colo. App.
    1984).</P>
    <P>
    <B>And is not to benefit one who misses preliminary
    hearing.</B>The general assembly did not intend that one
    accused of the commission of an offense should be permitted to
    profit from his failure to appear at the preliminary hearing
    and be in a better position than those other defendants who
    were released on bond and who had not violated the terms of
    their bond, or those defendants who had been unable to post
    bail initially and who had remained incarcerated for the entire
    pretrial period after arrest. People v. Olds, 656 P.2d 705
    (Colo. 1983) (disapproved in People v. Mascarenas, 706 P.2d 404
    (Colo. 1985)).</P>
    <P>
    <B>A second bail bond</B>entered after the defendant was
    returned to the custody of the court was not an increase of the
    first bond, which was forfeited and ceased to exist after the
    defendant failed to appear at his preliminary hearing.
    Therefore, the defendant's speedy trial rights were not
    violated when he was not brought to trial within ninety days
    after entry of the second bond. People v. Armendariz, 684 P.2d
    252 (Colo. App. 1983).</P>
    <P>
    <B>Defendant whose bail was revoked following finding that
    proof was evident and presumption great in capital offense
    case</B>pursuant to Art. II, § 19, Colo. Const., had no right
    to trial within 90 days of revocation. People v. Avery, 736
    P.2d 1233 (Colo. App. 1986).</P>
    <P>
    <B>Defendant on bond may leave jurisdiction unless ordered
    otherwise.</B>Generally, unless the court orders or the surety
    stipulates otherwise, nothing prevents a defendant on bond from
    leaving the jurisdiction so long as he appears at all
    proceedings in his case. People v. Rincon, 43 Colo. App. 155,

    <B>Subsection (2) modifications permitted only after

    subsection (2) relate only to those bail proceedings which
    occur after arraignment. People v. Olds, 656 P.2d 705 (Colo.
    1983) (disapproved in People v. Mascarenas, 706 P.2d 404 (Colo.

  person has voluntarily enrolled and is participating in an
  appropriate substance use disorder treatment program.</M></P>

  <M>Pretrial services programs.</M></CATCH-LINE>(1)
  <M>The chief judge of any judicial district may order a person
  who is eligible for bond or other pretrial release to be
  evaluated by a pretrial services program established pursuant to
  this section, which program may advise the court if the person is
  bond eligible, may provide information that enables the court to
  make an appropriate decision on bond and conditions of release,
  and may recommend conditions of release consistent with this
  section. The chief judge may make such order in any or all of the
  counties of the chief judge's judicial district.</M>
  <P N="(2)">(2)
  <M>The chief judge of any judicial district shall endeavor to
  consult, on an annual basis, with the county or counties within
  the judicial district in an effort to support and encourage the
  development by the county or counties, to the extent practicable
  and within available resources, of pretrial services programs
  that support the work of the court and evidence-based
  decision-making in determining the type of bond and conditions of
  release.</M></P>
  <P N="(3)">(3)
  <M>To reduce barriers to the pretrial release of persons in
  custody whose release on bond with appropriate conditions
  reasonably assures court appearance and public safety, all
  counties and cities and counties are encouraged to develop a
  pretrial services program in consultation with the chief judge of
  the judicial district in an effort to establish a pretrial
  services program that may be utilized by the district court of
  such county or city and county. Any pretrial services program
  must be established pursuant to a plan formulated by a community
  advisory board created for such purpose and appointed by the
  chief judge of the judicial district. Membership on such
  community advisory board must include, at a minimum, a
  representative of a local law enforcement agency, a
  representative of the district attorney, a representative of the
  public defender, and a representative of the citizens at large.
  The chief judge is encouraged to appoint to the community
  advisory board at least one representative of the bail bond
  industry who conducts business in the judicial district, which
  may include a bail bondsman, a bail surety, or other designated
  bail industry representative. The plan formulated by such
  community advisory board must be approved by the chief judge of
  the judicial district prior to the establishment and utilization
  of the pretrial services program. The option contained in this
  section that a pretrial services program be established pursuant
  to a plan formulated by the community advisory board does not
  apply to any pretrial services program that existed before May
  31, 1991.</M></P>
  <P N="(4)">(4)
  <M>Any pretrial services program approved pursuant to this
  section must meet the following criteria:</M></P>
  <P N="(4)(a)">(a)
  <M>The program must establish a procedure for the screening of
  persons who are detained due to an arrest for the alleged
  commission of a crime so that such information may be provided to
  the judge who is setting the bond and conditions of release. The
  program must provide information that provides the court with the
  ability to make an appropriate initial bond decision that is
  based upon facts relating to the person's risk of failure to
  appear for court and risk of danger to the community.</M></P>
  <P N="(4)(b)">(b)
  <M>The program must make all reasonable attempts to provide the
  court with such information delineated in this section as is
  appropriate to each individual person seeking release from
  custody;</M></P>
  <P N="(4)(c)">(c)
  <M>The program, in conjunction with the community advisory board,
  must make all reasonable efforts to implement an empirically
  developed pretrial risk assessment tool, to be used by the
  program, the court, and the parties to the case solely for the
  purpose of assessing pretrial risk, and a structured
  decision-making design based upon the person's charge and the
  risk assessment score; and</M></P>
  <P N="(4)(d)">(d)
  <M>The program must work with all appropriate agencies and assist
  with all efforts to comply with sections 24-4.1-302.5 and
  24-4.1-303, C.R.S.</M></P>
  <P N="(5)">(5)
  <M>Any pretrial services program may also include different
  methods and levels of community-based supervision as a condition
  of release, and the program must use established methods for
  persons who are released prior to trial in order to decrease
  unnecessary pretrial detention. The program may include, but is
  not limited to, any of the criteria as outlined in section
  16-4-105 (8) as conditions for pretrial release.</M></P>
  <P N="(6)">(6)
  <M>Commencing July 1, 2012, each pretrial services program
  established pursuant to this section shall provide an annual
  report to the judicial department no later than November 1 of
  each year, regardless of whether the program existed prior to May
  31, 1991. Notwithstanding section 24-1-136 (11)(a)(I), the
  judicial department shall present an annual combined report to
  the house and senate judiciary committees of the house of
  representatives and the senate, or any successor committees, of
  the general assembly. The report to the judicial department must
  include, but is not limited to, the following

    <B>Annotator's note.</B>Since § 16-4-108 is similar to §

    of this part 1, relevant cases decided under that provision and

    the annotations to this section. 
    <P>
    <B>Purpose of section.</B>The purpose of § 16-4-201 concerning
    bail after conviction and this section is to authorize the
    court to exercise discretion rather than follow a fixed policy
    and to permit a recognizance to remain in effect, without the
    necessity of a new bond, after conviction and until disposition
    of the case in the trial court. Trujillo v. District Court, 131
    Colo. 428, 282 P.2d 703 (1955).</P>

    191 Colo. 540, 554 P.2d 291 (1976).</P>
    <P>
    <B>And trial court could not continue bond without first
    obtaining surety's consent.</B>Rodriguez v. People, 191 Colo.
    540, 554 P.2d 291 (1976).</P>
    <P>Although the trial judge may continue the original bond to
    final disposition, he must obtain the consent of the surety to
    continue it beyond conviction. Rodriguez v. People, 191 Colo.
    540, 554 P.2d 291 (1976).</P>
    <P>
    <B>Increase of surety's risk without his consent terminates
    obligation.</B>When one undertakes a surety obligation, the
    surety undertakes a calculated risk, and events which
    materially increase that risk without consent of the surety
    terminate the obligation of the bond. People v. Smith, 645 P.2d
    864 (Colo. App. 1982).</P>
    <P>
    <B>Effect of resettings of the case.</B>Where there were
    resettings of a criminal case for trial at the same term, the
    contention of a surety on defendant's bond that he was
    discharged by these continuances without his consent was
    overruled. Van Gilder v. People, 75 Colo. 515, 227 P. 386

    386 (1924).</P>
    <P>
    <B>Nor is incarceration after appearance date.</B>The rule that
    incarceration of a principal on the return date of his bond
    permits relief from forfeiture of the bond has no application
    where the principal was at large and was not imprisoned until
    30 days after the date he was to appear in Colorado, and the
    surety, through its agent, had the opportunity to return the
    principal to Colorado before judgment was entered and thus be
    absolved under our statutes of any liability other than costs
    incurred by the people by reason of the principal's failure to
    appear. Union Benefit Fire Ins. Co. v. People, 160 Colo. 211,
    416 P.2d 368 (1966).</P>
    <P>
    <B>However, surety not liable if principal is arrested and
    jailed for another offense.</B>Under this section where, after
    forfeiture but before judgment against the sureties, their
    principal was arrested and placed in the jail of the county
    under a different charge than that for which the bond was
    given, the sureties were entitled to a discharge from liability
    upon their formal offer to surrender and the payment of the
    costs, although they did nothing towards the rearresting and
    returning to custody of the prisoner. And they were not liable
    for costs incurred in arresting and returning their principal
    under a different charge than the one in which the bond was
    given. Huston v. People ex rel. Collins, 12 Colo. App. 271, 55
    P. 262 (1898).</P>
    <P>
    <B>Or if a cause brought by the state is in fact
    abandoned</B>by the state, by reason of which the presence of
    the accused in court is no longer required or desired for trial
    or matters incident thereto, the purpose of the bail bond has
    been served, its function fulfilled and performed, and it
    should thenceforth be regarded as functus officio and the
    formal discharge of defendant and of his sureties therefrom
    should be entered upon application. Herbertson v. People, 160
    Colo. 139, 415 P.2d 53 (1966).</P>
    <P>
    <B>Surety needs not personally accomplish the seizure and
    surrender.</B>Where defendant was stopped for a traffic offense
    and was taken into custody by sheriff's deputies on the
    outstanding warrant, surety was entitled to exoneration under
    this section. People v. Madison, 909 P.2d 551 (Colo. App.
    1995).</P>
    <P>
    <B>The term "costs",</B>as used in this section, includes
    whatever the law officers may legitimately pay out, or have a
    right to charge, in connection with the return of the criminal
    for trial. Ayres v. People, 3 Colo. App. 117, 32 P. 77
    (1893).</P>
    <P>
    <B>Liability of surety for costs.</B>Sureties must pay the
    expenses incurred by the county in procuring the return of
    their principal from another state upon a requisition. Ayres v.
    People, 3 Colo. App. 117, 32 P. 77 (1893).</P>
    <P>To accomplish the purpose of giving bail, courts have been
    liberal in vacating judgments entered on bail bonds, exercising
    always a broad discretion and in proper cases preserving the
    equities of the public by deducting such costs and expenses as
    may have been incurred by the state. To hold otherwise would
    discourage the giving of bail and defeat the manifest purpose
    of the statute. Allison v. People, 132 Colo. 156, 286 P.2d 1102
    (1955).</P>
    <P>
    <B>When court may require return of premium.</B>A court has the
    discretion to require a surety to return all or a portion of
    the premium paid for a bail bond where the bond is terminated
    by court order. People v. Walker, 665 P.2d 154 (Colo. App.
    1983), aff'd sub nom. Yording v. Walker, 683 P.2d 788 (Colo.
    1984) (decided prior to enactment of subsection (1)(d) in
    1985).</P>
    <P>
    <B>Subsection (1)(c) takes precedence over bond
    provisions.</B>The language of subsection (1)(c) protecting
    against unjust enrichment takes precedence over, and nullifies,
    a provision in a bond purporting to make a bond premium
    nonrefundable. People v. Walker, 665 P.2d 154 (Colo. App.
    1983), aff'd sub nom. Yording v. Walker, 683 P.2d 788 (Colo.
    1984) (decided prior to enactment of subsection (1)(d) in
    1985).</P>
    <P>
    <B>Subsection (1.5) is broader than the rule in Yording</B>in
    that it permits a refund under circumstances other than an
    error of law, subject to the time limitation. People v.
    Goldsmith, 955 P.2d 561 (Colo. App. 1997).</P>
    <P>
    <B>This section does not grant authority to the court to refund
    a bond premium to a defendant whose surrender occurred after
    the defendant's required initial appearance.</B>Under
    subsection (1)(d), a court may order return of the premium to
    prevent unjust enrichment only if the surrender occurred prior
    to a defendant's initial appearance. People v. Fallis, 2017 COA
    131M, 488 P.3d 291.</P>
    <P>
    <B>Reincarceration of the defendant on separate charges is not
    included among the additional grounds for exoneration of the
    surety.</B>People v. Goldsmith, 955 P.2d 561 (Colo. App.
    1997).</P>
    <P>
    <B>Even though both subsections (1)(c) and (1.5) were
    inapplicable, court had common law authority to order bond
    premium refund</B>where the bond at issue did not involve a
    defendant, but rather a nonparty, and surety would have been
    unjustly enriched if allowed to retain the bond premium. People
    v. Gonzales, 28 P.3d 967 (Colo. App. 2001).</P>
    <P>
    <B>The 30-day limitation referred to in subsection
    (1.5)</B>applies only to the interval between the posting of
    the bond and any changes in its terms or conditions, and not to
    the time within which an order for refund of bond premium must
    be entered. People v. Perse, 750 P.2d 923 (Colo. App.
    1988).</P>
    <P>
    <B>Determination of amount of premium refund due to defendant
    in case of conversion of bond into release on personal
    recognizance.</B>The determination of the amount of premium
    refund due to the defendant is a matter within the trial
    court's discretion, and the court may not be reversed absent an
    abuse of discretion. People v. Anderson, 789 P.2d 1115 (Colo.
    App. 1990).</P>
    <P>
    <B>"Appearance date", as used in this subsection
    (1)(c),</B>includes appearance up to the date of conviction.
    Thus, surety was required to refund a bond premium to a
    defendant whom surety surrendered prior to such date. People v.
    Carrethers, 867 P.2d 189 (Colo. App. 1993).</P>
    <P>
    <B>Trial court correctly entered judgment of forfeiture of bond
    posted by surety</B>where, even if the notice of order of
    forfeiture was mailed several days late, nothing in the record
    indicated that surety suffered any resulting prejudice or that
    surety asserted any grounds under this section or § 16-4-109
    for setting aside the order of forfeiture or vacating the
    judgment. People v. King, 924 P.2d 1092 (Colo. App.

    of this part 1, relevant cases decided under that provision and
    former provisions similar to that section have been included in

    <P>
    <B>There must be due process before any judgment may issue in

    <P>
    <B>Judgment cannot be entered same day as forfeiture.</B>In a
    bail bond forfeiture proceeding at a hearing to determine
    whether the principal is in default, judgment against the
    surety cannot be entered on the same day. Herbertson v. People,

    <P>
    <B>Judgment for penal sum or costs allowed.</B>When it appears
    that the defendant was pursued, apprehended, and returned by
    the state, without any assistance from those answerable for his
    appearance, judgment should be entered for the penal sum of the
    bond, unless the court, in light of all of the circumstances
    surrounding defendant's failure to appear in the exercise of
    its sound discretion may see fit to enter judgment for a lesser
    amount. In no event should judgment be entered for an amount
    less than the full amount of costs occasioned by the
    defendant's failure to appear. People v. Johnson, 155 Colo.

    <P>
    <B>Surety should act promptly where recognizance
    forfeited.</B>A surety on a criminal recognizance which has
    been forfeited who wishes to obtain relief from liability
    should act promptly and while evidence against the defendant is
    still available. Van Gilder v. City &amp; County of Denver, 104
    Colo. 76, 89 P.2d 529 (1939).</P>
    <P>
    <B>Acts of God, of the state, or of law relieve a surety from
    liability.</B>A trial court has no jurisdiction to relieve the
    surety from liability on a bail bond except on grounds
    generally recognized by the law as excusing the performance of
    the undertaking, and such grounds exist only when the
    appearance of accused is made impossible by an act of God, an
    act of the state which is the beneficiary of the bond, or an
    act of law. Where the principal in a bail bond dies before the
    day of performance or is prevented by illness from appearing,
    the case is within the first category. Where the principal in a
    bail bond is in prison within the state, pursuant to a judgment
    of a court of competent jurisdiction of the state, the case
    comes within the second category. Where the party has been
    turned over to the federal court within the state by a prior
    bondsman and is serving a sentence by that court, or if the
    party has been arrested in the state where the obligation is
    given and sent out of the state by the governor upon
    requisition from another state or foreign jurisdiction, the
    case falls within the third category. Allison v. People, 132
    Colo. 156, 286 P.2d 1102 (1955).</P>
    <P>Where the defendant in a criminal case is imprisoned in
    another state at the time his case is called for trial and
    cannot appear pursuant to the conditions of his bond, and the
    surety thereon offers to defray the costs and expenses involved
    in returning the defendant to Colorado upon completion of the
    imprisonment which prevented his attendance in the trial court,
    the surety is relieved from a forfeiture. Allison v. People,
    132 Colo. 156, 286 P.2d 1102 (1955).</P>
    <P>Where the defendant is not produced at all, or turns up only
    after a long lapse of time, the courts will ordinarily deny
    remission without regard to the mitigating factors asserted in
    connection with his nonappearance, except in cases of death,
    insanity, or imprisonment. People v. Johnson, 155 Colo. 392,
    395 P.2d 19 (1964).</P>
    <P>
    <B>Defendant who is transferred from the state's custody to a
    federal agency</B>pursuant to a detainer has never been
    released into the legal custody of the surety who is
    consequently discharged from any liability on the bond. People
    v. Gonzales, 745 P.2d 263 (Colo. App. 1987).</P>
    <P>
    <B>Hospitalization is valid excuse for failure to
    appear.</B>The defendant's hospitalization following an
    automobile accident is a valid excuse for his failure to appear
    at a scheduled hearing. People v. Smith, 673 P.2d 1026 (Colo.
    App. 1983).</P>
    <P>
    <B>The standard in subsection (3) is essentially an appeal to
    the conscience of the court.</B>No clear rule can be set down
    which will guide the trial court in every case since the facts
    and circumstances of each individual case must be considered in
    their totality. No one factor will be determinative in all
    cases. Owens v. People, 194 Colo. 389, 572 P.2d 837 (1977).</P>
    <P>
    <B>And court has discretion to relieve forfeiture for other
    reasons.</B>Following the rule that the discretion is in the
    court to do as it sees fit about forfeiting a bond, matters
    which would appeal to the sympathy of the ordinary individual,
    even if not to a judge, should be put in evidence. Allison v.
    People, 132 Colo. 156, 286 P.2d 1102 (1955).</P>
    <P>The decision as to whether or not a forfeited bond should be
    remitted is entrusted to the trial court's discretion by
    subsection (3) of this section and Crim. P. 46. Owens v.
    People, 194 Colo. 389, 572 P.2d 837 (1977).</P>
    <P>Trial court abused its discretion where the sureties made
    substantial efforts to locate, seize, and surrender defendant
    to authorities, and defendant was in custody in the adjoining
    county due principally to the efforts of the sureties. People
    v. Mendez, 708 P.2d 126 (Colo. App. 1985).</P>
    <P>
    <B>Forfeiture proceeding not to enrich public treasury.</B>The
    enriching of the public treasury is not part of the object at
    which a forfeiture proceeding is aimed. People v. Campbell, 633
    P.2d 509 (Colo. App. 1981).</P>
    <P>
    <B>Effect of material increase of risk to bondsman.</B>When a
    bondsman enters into a surety agreement, he undertakes a
    calculated risk, so that events which materially increase that
    risk have the effect of terminating the obligation. People v.
    Calloway, 40 Colo. App. 543, 577 P.2d 1109 (1978).</P>
    <P>
    <B>Court not required to notify surety of defendant's permitted
    absence.</B>Neither the case law nor subsection (2) imposes a
    duty on the court to give a surety notice of the permitted
    absence of a defendant from a hearing. People v. Smith, 673
    P.2d 1026 (Colo. App. 1983).</P>
    <P>
    <B>By approving defendant's departure from state without notice
    to surety,</B>the court terminates any control the surety might
    have had over the defendant and the court's action discharges
    the surety from any obligation under a bail bond. People v.
    Calloway, 40 Colo. App. 543, 577 P.2d 1109 (1978).</P>
    <P>
    <B>Words "without leave" in the bond do not include departure
    from the jurisdiction</B>of the court. But where the defendant
    given permission to absent himself only from the court and not
    from the court's jurisdiction, the court complies with the
    existing conditions of the bond contract, rather than changing
    them, materially or otherwise. People v. Smith, 673 P.2d 1026
    (Colo. App. 1983).</P>
    <P>
    <B>Considerations in determining whether to order remission of
    forfeited bond.</B>In exercising its discretion as to whether
    to order remission of a forfeited bond, the trial court may
    consider whether the defendant has been produced within a
    reasonable time after forfeiture, whether the people have lost
    any rights against the defendant, whether the defendant's
    failure to appear was wilful, and whether a forfeiture will
    subject the surety to an extreme hardship. People v.
    Schliesser, 39 Colo. App. 54, 563 P.2d 377, rev'd on other
    grounds sub nom. Owens v. People, 194 Colo. 389, 572 P.2d 837
    (1977).</P>
    <P>
    <B>Such as hardship to surety.</B>When state incurred no
    expenses and lost no legal rights due to defendant's
    nonappearance and guarantor of bond was subjected to extreme
    hardship due to monthly payments on the bond, the trial court
    abused its discretion in denying a motion for return of the
    forfeited bond. Owens v. People, 194 Colo. 389, 572 P.2d 837
    (1977).</P>
    <P>The only factor which the courts of this state have
    considered as basis for remission where the principal
    disappears is whether the surety will thereby suffer extreme
    hardship, such hardships as will cause destitution to a family,
    deprive children of support and education, or creditors of
    their just debts. People v. Johnson, 155 Colo. 392, 395 P.2d 19
    (1964).</P>
    <P>Where defendant is produced within reasonable time after
    forfeiture, remission will be granted to a surety if the people
    have not lost any rights as a result of his nonappearance,
    especially if his failure to appear was other than deliberate
    and wilful. People v. Johnson, 155 Colo. 392, 395 P.2d 19

  entering into a bond, each obligor, whether he or she is the

  His or her liability under the bond may be enforced, without the

  order the issuance of a citation directed to the obligor to show
  cause, if any there be, why judgment should not be entered
  against him or her forthwith and execution issue thereon. Said
  citation may be served personally or by certified mail upon the

  citation shall be held not less than twenty-one days after
  service. The defendant's attorney and the prosecuting attorney
  shall be given notice of the hearing. At the conclusion of the

  <ANNO-NOTE>
    <ANNO-TEXT>
    <B>Annotator's note.</B>Since § 16-4-114 is similar to §
    16-4-112 as it existed prior to the 2013 repeal and reenactment
    of this part 1, relevant cases decided under that provision
    have been included in the annotations to this section. 
    <P>
    <B>Subsection (5)(h) authorizes a trial court to order that a
    bail forfeiture judgment be set aside upon such conditions as
    the court may impose, "if it appears that justice so
    requires".</B>This standard is essentially an appeal to the
    conscience of the court. No clear rule can be set down that
    will guide the trial court in every instance, because the court
    must consider the totality of facts and circumstances in each
    individual case. People v. Escalera, 121 P.3d 306 (Colo. App.
    2005); People v. Diaz-Garcia, 159 P.3d 679 (Colo. App.
    2006).</P>
    <P>Factors the court should consider include: (1) The
    willfulness of the defendant's violations of the conditions of
    bail; (2) the surety's participation in locating or
    apprehending the defendant; (3) the cost, inconvenience, and
    prejudice suffered by the state resulting from the violation;
    (4) any intangible costs; (5) the public interest in ensuring
    the defendant's appearance; and (6) any other mitigating
    factors. These factors encompass the principle that generally
    only acts of God, of the state, or of law will relieve a surety
    from liability. People v. Bustamante-Payan, 856 P.2d 42 (Colo.
    App. 1993) (decided under former § 16-4-109 (3)); People v.
    Escalera, 121 P.3d 306 (Colo. App. 2005); People v.
    Diaz-Garcia, 159 P.3d 679 (Colo. App. 2006).</P>
    <P>In exercising its discretion, a trial court should be
    mindful of the policies concerning bail, including the policy
    that sureties should not be penalized when it appears they are
    unable, through no fault of their own, to perform the condition
    of the bond. People v. Escalera, 121 P.3d 306 (Colo. App.
    2005).</P></ANNO-TEXT>

  <M>After conviction, either before or after sentencing, the
  defendant may orally, or in writing, move for release on bail
  pending determination of a motion for a new trial or motion in
  arrest of judgment or during any stay of execution or pending
  review by an appellate court, and, except in cases where the
  defendant has been convicted of a capital offense, the trial
  court, in its discretion, may continue the bond given for
  pretrial release, or may release the defendant on bond with
  additional conditions including monetary conditions, or require
  bond under one or more of the alternatives set forth in section
  16-4-104.</M>
  <P N="(1)(b)">(b)
  <M>The district attorney must be present at the time the court

  surety shall indicate, in writing and at the time of the posting
  of bond, if the surety consents to the continuance of the bond
  through sentencing of the defendant. If the surety does not
  provide written consent at the time of the initial posting of
  bond, the surety may provide written consent at the time of the
  plea of guilty or nolo contendere or within a reasonable time
  thereafter as determined by the court. A court shall not require

    <B>Purpose of section.</B>The purpose of § 16-4-106 and this

    than follow a fixed policy and to permit a recognizance to
    remain in effect, without the necessity of a new bond, after

    <B>Entry of guilty verdict or acceptance of guilty plea

    a "conviction" occurs and is complete either upon the entry of
    a guilty verdict following trial or upon the acceptance of a
    plea of guilty, either to the original charge or to a lesser

    <P>
    <B>This section does not require separate or renewed

    <P>
    <B>Applicability of pretrial bond to post-trial
    period.</B>While the terms of the original pretrial bond may
    also cover the post-trial period, without such a provision,
    this section is controlling as to post-trial continuances of a
    bond. Where the language and terms of the original bond do not
    provide the court with the requisite written consent to
    continue liability beyond conviction, oral statements to the
    court, after the defendant fails to appear, do not bind the
    surety. People v. Hampton, 662 P.2d 498 (Colo. App. 1983).</P>
    <P>
    <B>Where contract deemed to impose postconviction
    liability.</B>By executing bail bond contracts containing
    language binding them until the final sentence or order of the
    court, sureties are deemed to have given the statutorily
    required written consent to continue their liability on the
    bonds after conviction and until sentencing. O'Neil v. People,
    198 Colo. 9, 595 P.2d 235 (1979).</P>
    <P>
    <B>Defendant's tender of signed petition and stipulation
    constituted a "plea of guilty"</B>within the meaning of the

    <P>
    <B>A conviction is not necessary to exonerate the surety;</B>a

  <ANNO-NOTE>
    <ANNO-TEXT>
    <B>Annotator's note.</B>Since § 16-4-204 is similar to repealed
    § 39-2-17, CRS 53, relevant cases construing that provision
    have been included in the annotations to this section. 
    <P>
    <B>Pursuant to this section, an appellate court may hear an
    appeal of an order entered pursuant to § 16-4-109.</B>In 2013,
    the provisions of § 16-4-107 were moved with minor changes to §
    16-4-109, but a conforming amendment was not made to this
    section to include the new § 16-4-109. This created a question
    of ambiguity as to whether this section still applies to the
    subject matter that was originally in § 16-4-107 but is now
    contained in § 16-4-109. The ambiguity does not limit an
    appellate court from appeals related to the subject matter of
    the original § 16-4-107 with respect to the reduction or
    increase in the amount of bail. People v. Jones, 2015 CO 20,
    346 P.3d 44.</P>
    <P>
    <B>This section authorizes an appeal of a court order modifying
    a bail bond using the criteria in § 16-4-105 since the
    authority for the order is found in § 16-4-109.</B>This section
    authorizes an appeal of a court order related to determination,
    modification, and continuation of bail bonds. Although §
    16-4-105 provided the evidentiary basis for changing a
    defendant's bond, a court's authority to modify the bond is
    found in § 16-4-109, which serves as a basis for hearing the
    appeal. People v. Jones, 2015 CO 20, 346 P.3d 44.</P>
    <P>
    <B>Review of excessive bail.</B>Where the bond fixed by the
    trial court in a criminal case is so grossly excessive as to
    amount to a denial of the right of accused to be admitted to
    bail in a reasonable amount, the supreme court will direct that
    the accused be admitted to bail in reasonable amount. Altobella
    v. District Court, 153 Colo. 143, 385 P.2d 663 (1963).</P>
    <P>If the bail is deemed excessive, relief may be sought by
    suitable proceedings, but not through appeal after conviction
    of the crime charged. Corbett v. People, 153 Colo. 457, 387
    P.2d 409 (1963), cert. denied, 377 U.S. 939, 84 S. Ct. 1346, 12
    L. Ed. 2d 302 (1964).</P>
    <P>
    <B>Review of refusal to admit prisoner to bail.</B>Where a
    petitioner is adjudged guilty of contempt of court for refusal
    to answer questions before the grand jury and is sentenced to
    four months in jail, refusal of the trial court to stay
    execution or admit the petitioner to bail pending review by the
    supreme court is an abuse of discretion. Smaldone v. People,
    153 Colo. 208, 385 P.2d 127 (1963).</P>
    <P>A claim of error that court refused to admit defendant to
    bail may be raised by appropriate proceedings, but not by
    appeal after conviction of the crime charged. Corbett v.
    People, 153 Colo. 457, 387 P.2d 409 (1963), cert. denied, 377

  <M>Identity theft victims - definitions.</M></CATCH-LINE>(1)
  <M>A person whose identifying information has been mistakenly
  associated with an arrest, summons, summons and complaint, felony
  complaint, information, indictment, or conviction is a victim of
  identity theft for the purposes of this section. A victim of
  identify theft may proceed either through the judicial process in
  subsection (2) of this section or the Colorado bureau of
  investigation process in subsection (3) of this section.</M>
  <P N="(2)(a)">(2)
  <N></N>(a)
  <M>If a criminal charge is not pending, a victim of identity
  theft may, with notice to the prosecutor, petition the court with
  jurisdiction over the arrest, summons, summons and complaint,
  felony complaint, information, indictment, or conviction to
  judicially determine the person's factual innocence.
  Alternatively, the court, on its own motion, may make such a
  determination in the case. If a criminal charge is pending, the
  prosecuting attorney may request the court to make such a
  determination. A judicial determination of factual innocence made
  pursuant to this section may be determined, with or without a
  hearing, upon declarations, affidavits, or police reports or upon
  any other relevant, material, reliable information submitted by
  the parties and records of the court.</M></P>
  <P N="(2)(b)">(b)
  <M>If the court determines that there is no reasonable cause to
  believe that a victim of identity theft committed the offense for
  which the victim's identity has been mistakenly associated with
  an arrest, summons, summons and complaint, felony complaint,
  information, indictment, or conviction, the court shall find the
  victim factually innocent of that offense. If the victim is found
  factually innocent, the court shall issue an order certifying
  this determination.</M></P>
  <P N="(2)(c)">(c)
  <M>After the court has determined that a person is factually
  innocent, the court shall provide the Colorado bureau of
  investigation with the order of factual innocence. Upon receipt
  of the order of factual innocence, the Colorado bureau of
  investigation shall modify the victim of identity theft's law
  enforcement-only and public criminal history record
  accordingly.</M></P>
  <P N="(2)(d)">(d)
  <M>A court that issues a determination of factual innocence
  pursuant to this section may at any time vacate that
  determination if the petition, or information submitted in
  support of the petition, contains material misrepresentation or

  the court shall issue an order rescinding any orders made
  pursuant to this subsection (2).</M></P>

  <N></N>(a)
  <M>A person who has had his or her identity stolen or used that
  is not associated with an arrest, summons, summons and complaint,
  felony complaint, information, indictment, or conviction may
  petition the district court in the county where the person lives
  for an order of factual innocence. A judicial determination of
  factual innocence made pursuant to this section may be
  determined, with or without a hearing, upon declarations,
  affidavits, or any other relevant, material, reliable information
  submitted by the parties and records of the court.</M></P>
  <P N="(2.5)(b)">(b)

  <M>A court that issues a determination of factual innocence
  pursuant to this subsection (2.5) may at any time vacate that
  determination if the petition, or information submitted in

  the court shall issue an order rescinding any orders made
  pursuant to this subsection (2.5).</M></P>

  <N></N>(a)
  <M>A victim of identity theft may contact the Colorado bureau of
  investigation and submit a records challenge to one or more

  committed. The victim of identity theft shall include a copy of
  his or her fingerprints with the records challenge.</M></P>
  <P N="(3)(b)(I)">(b)
  <N></N>(I)
  <M>A Colorado bureau of investigation fingerprint examiner shall

  the fingerprints obtained in each criminal case that the victim
  of identity theft is making a records challenge.</M></P>
  <P N="(3)(b)(II)">(II)
  <M>The fingerprint examiner shall determine either that the
  fingerprints submitted in the records challenge are not the same
  as the individual arrested or that they are the same as the
  individual arrested.</M></P>
  <P N="(3)(b)(III)">(III)
  <M>If the fingerprint examiner determines the fingerprints
  submitted in the fingerprint challenge are not the same as the
  individual arrested, the Colorado bureau of investigation shall
  issue a letter of misidentification and shall modify the victim
  of identity theft's law enforcement-only and public criminal
  history record accordingly. The letter of misidentification shall
  state the holder of the letter is a victim of identity theft in
  each criminal case identified by the letter.</M></P>
  <P N="(4)">(4)
  <M>A person who knows or reasonably suspects that his or her
  identifying information has been unlawfully used by another
  person may initiate a law enforcement investigation by contacting
  the local law enforcement agency that has jurisdiction over the
  victim's residence or over the place where a crime was committed.
  Such agency shall take a police report of the matter, provide the
  complainant with a copy of that report, and begin an
  investigation of the facts. If the suspected crime was committed
  in a different jurisdiction, the local law enforcement agency may
  refer the matter to the local law enforcement agency where the
  suspected crime was committed for investigation of the
  facts.</M></P>

    <B>Annotator's note.</B>Since § 16-5-201 is similar to repealed
    § 39-3-1, C.R.S. 1963, CSA, C. 48, § 447, and laws antecedent
    thereto, relevant cases construing those provisions have been
    included in the annotations to this section.</P>
    <P>
    <B>It is the province of the general assembly to provide what
    elements of an offense must be set forth</B>in an indictment or
    information. Edwards v. People, 176 Colo. 478, 491 P.2d 566
    (1971).</P>
    <P>
    <B>Purpose of section.</B>This section and § 16-10-202, dealing
    with variance between allegations and proof, undoubtedly were
    adopted by the general assembly with a view of removing from
    consideration those technical rules of pleading long the bane
    of criminal procedure at common law and the occasion of many
    miscarriages of justice in antiquated times. Helser v. People,
    100 Colo. 371, 68 P.2d 543 (1937).</P>
    <P>One purpose of the requirements of this section is to
    provide sufficient notice to defendants to permit the
    preparation of defenses prior to trial. People v. Thimmes, 643
    P.2d 780 (Colo. App. 1981).</P>
    <P>
    <B>Purposes of criminal indictment by grand jury are
    twofold:</B>First, it must give the defendant sufficient notice
    of the crime that has allegedly been committed so that a
    defense may be prepared; second, it must define the acts which
    constitute the crime with sufficient definiteness so that the
    defendant may plead the resolution of the indictment as a bar
    to subsequent proceedings. People v. Tucker, 631 P.2d 162
    (Colo. 1981).</P>
    <P>
    <B>This section does not encourage subtleties and
    hypertechnical refinements</B>in criminal cases. Sweek v.
    People, 85 Colo. 479, 277 P. 1 (1929).</P>
    <P>
    <B>An information or indictment charging offense in language of
    the statute is sufficient.</B>Schneider v. People, 30 Colo.
    493, 71 P. 369 (1903); Knepper v. People, 63 Colo. 396, 167 P.
    779 (1917); Balfe v. People, 66 Colo. 94, 179 P. 137 (1919);
    People v. Maestas, 199 Colo. 143, 606 P.2d 849 (1980).</P>
    <P>An indictment or information is sufficient which describes
    an offense either in the language of the statute or so plainly
    that the nature of the crime may be readily and easily
    understood by a jury. Albert v. People, 90 Colo. 219, 7 P.2d
    822 (1932).</P>
    <P>A charge so worded that it is "sufficient technically and
    correct", sufficiently sets forth the substance of the offense.
    If an indictment is correct when it charges in the words of the
    statute, then it must contain the substance of the offense.
    Papas v. People, 98 Colo. 306, 55 P.2d 1330 (1936).</P>
    <P>
    <B>It need not follow the exact language of the

    Albert v. People, 90 Colo. 219, 7 P.2d 822 (1932).</P>
    <P>
    <B>It must be so charged that it may be readily understood by
    accused and jury.</B>Tracy v. People, 65 Colo. 226, 176 P. 280

    Schreiner v. People, 95 Colo. 392, 36 P.2d 764 (1934).</P>
    <P>
    <B>But it need not furnish such detail as to bar further
    prosecution.</B>An indictment or information need not plead an
    offense in such detail as to be self-sufficient as a bar to
    further prosecution for the same offense for the judgment
    constitutes the bar. Howe v. People, 178 Colo. 248, 496 P.2d
    1040 (1972).</P>
    <P>
    <B>The ultimate test of the sufficiency of an indictment</B>is
    whether it is sufficiently definite to inform the defendant of
    the charges against him so as to enable him to prepare a
    defense and to plead the judgment in bar of any further
    prosecutions for the same offense. People v. Westendorf, 37
    Colo. App. 111, 542 P.2d 1300 (1975); People v. Donachy, 196
    Colo. 289, 586 P.2d 14 (1978).</P>
    <P>An indictment must be definite enough to give defendant
    sufficient notice of the crime alleged to prepare a defense.
    People v. Gable, 647 P.2d 246 (Colo. App. 1982).</P>
    <P>
    <B>Right to be informed of nature of charges.</B>It is a
    defendant's right to be informed with reasonable certainty of
    the nature of the charges against him by requiring that an
    indictment answer the questions of "who, what, where and how"
    in cases where the acts constituting the offense are not
    adequately described by the statute. People v. Donachy, 196
    Colo. 289, 586 P.2d 14 (1978).</P>
    <P>
    <B>Exceptions to general rule.</B>If, as is not uncommon, the
    court by construction restricts a statute to a narrower
    application than its general words would indicate, an
    indictment on it in the statutory words will be ill; it must
    follow the court's narrower construction. Schneider v. People,
    30 Colo. 493, 71 P. 369 (1903).</P>
    <P>If the statute does not sufficiently set out the facts which
    constitute the offense so that the defendant may have notice of
    what he is charged, or if the words of the statute by their
    generality embrace cases which fall within the terms but not
    within the spirit or meaning of the statute, then a more
    particular statement of facts is necessary, and the specific
    facts to bring the defendant precisely within the inhibition of
    the law must be alleged. Schneider v. People, 30 Colo. 493, 71
    P. 369 (1903); Knepper v. People, 63 Colo. 396, 167 P. 779
    (1917); Balfe v. People, 66 Colo. 94, 179 P. 137 (1919).</P>
    <P>Where the acts constituting the offense are not described by
    the statute, an indictment merely reciting the statutory words
    is insufficient. People v. Xericos, 186 Colo. 21, 525 P.2d 415
    (1974).</P>
    <P>
    <B>Bill of particulars not part of indictment.</B>Although the
    purpose of a bill of particulars is to define more specifically
    the offense charged, a bill of particulars is not a part of an
    indictment nor an amendment thereto. It cannot in any way aid
    an indictment fundamentally bad. People v. Westendorf, 37 Colo.
    App. 111, 542 P.2d 1300 (1975).</P>
    <P>
    <B>Defendant is not legally charged by ineffective
    indictment.</B>Where indictment is ineffective because it
    charges petitioner with offense alleged to have occurred at
    time subsequent to filing of indictment, defendant is not
    legally charged or subject to jurisdiction of court as to that
    transaction until reindicted. Rowse v. District Court, 180
    Colo. 44, 502 P.2d 422 (1972).</P>
    <P>An insufficient indictment does not legally charge a crime
    or subject defendant to the jurisdiction of the court. People
    v. Westendorf, 37 Colo. App. 111, 542 P.2d 1300 (1975).</P>
    <P>
    <B>And omission of essential ingredient of offense may be taken
    advantage of at any stage.</B>If any essential ingredient of an
    offense is omitted, advantage thereof may be taken, at any
    stage of the proceedings, even after sentence has been
    pronounced. Iwerks v. People, 88 Colo. 578, 298 P. 644
    (1931).</P>
    <P>
    <B>Defective indictment may be asserted on appeal.</B>Although
    defendant did not raise the insufficiency of the indictment at
    trial or in his motion for new trial, he is not thereby
    precluded from asserting that defect now on appeal. People v.
    Westendorf, 37 Colo. App. 111, 542 P.2d 1300 (1975).</P>
    <P>
    <B>But technicalities not affecting substantial rights will not
    be considered on review.</B>Updike v. People, 92 Colo. 125, 18
    P.2d 472 (1933); Helser v. People, 100 Colo. 371, 68 P.2d 543
    (1937).</P>
    <P>
    <B>Charging an impossible date as time of occurrence of alleged
    offense is matter of substance, not form,</B>and attempt to
    indict a person for an offense alleged to have occurred
    subsequent to filing of indictment is a nullity. Rowse v.
    District Court, 180 Colo. 44, 502 P.2d 422 (1972).</P>
    <P>
    <B>Jeopardy does not attach by indictment defective in
    substance.</B>An indictment which is defective in substance
    merely prevents prosecution on the basis of that particular
    pleading. No jeopardy attaches, and the defendant may be
    charged by any appropriate and sufficient pleading. People v.
    Thimmes, 643 P.2d 780 (Colo. App. 1981).</P>
    <P>
    <B>Date of offense is material allegation.</B>Allegations
    specifying the date on which an accused allegedly committed an
    offense are always material when the offense charged is one
    which may be barred by an applicable statute of limitations.
    People v. Thimmes, 643 P.2d 780 (Colo. App. 1981).</P>
    <P>
    <B>Value need not be alleged if not essential.</B>Where the
    value is not essential to the punishment, as in indictments for
    robbery, it need not be distinctly alleged or proved. Rowan v.
    People, 93 Colo. 473, 26 P.2d 1066 (1933).</P>
    <P>
    <B>Applied</B>in Stoltz v. People, 59 Colo. 342, 148 P. 865

    <ANNO-TEXT>
    <B>Assault with intent to rob.</B>An indictment for assault
    with intent to rob which alleges, as to the assault, that the
    defendant "did make an assault", without stating all of the
    particulars comprehended by the statutory definition of that
    term is sufficient. McNamara v. People, 24 Colo. 61, 48 P. 541
    (1897). 
    <P>
    <B>Conspiracy.</B>In an indictment for conspiracy, unless the
    crime which it is alleged defendants conspired to commit is
    named, the indictment must allege facts constituting every
    element necessary to establish that offense as fully as if the
    indictment was for its perpetration. Imboden v. People, 40
    Colo. 142, 90 P. 608 (1907).</P>
    <P>An indictment for conspiracy need not aver the means by
    which the conspiracy was to be carried out. Imboden v. People,
    40 Colo. 142, 90 P. 608 (1907).</P>
    <P>Because of the veil of secrecy surrounding most
    conspiracies, considerable latitude is allowed in drafting a
    conspiracy indictment. People v. Gable, 647 P.2d 246 (Colo.
    App. 1982).</P>
    <P>
    <B>Forgery.</B>An indictment drawn upon the section relating to
    forgery is framed in the language of the act, and hence it was
    not essential to use the words "falsely make" or to set out the
    instrument. Cohen v. People, 7 Colo. 274, 3 P. 385 (1883).</P>
    <P>
    <B>Murder.</B>In an indictment for murder it is not necessary
    to state more than the statute provides in order to sustain a
    conviction of murder in the first degree. Andrews v. People, 33
    Colo. 193, 79 P. 1031 (1905).</P>
    <P>An indictment which simply charged that the defendant
    murdered the victim was upheld as constitutional. Bizup v.
    Tinsley, 211 F. Supp. 545 (D. Colo. 1962), aff'd, 316 F.2d 284
    (10th Cir. 1963).</P>
    <P>
    <B>Perjury.</B>A perjury indictment which does not set forth
    the alleged false statements, either verbatim or in substance,
    is insufficient to charge the crime. People v. Westendorf, 37
    Colo. App. 111, 542 P.2d 1300 (1975).</P>
    <P>A perjury indictment which tracks the language of §
    18-8-502(1) and included a verbatim partial transcript of the
    defendant's grand jury testimony which was asserted to be
    materially false, together with the additional averment that
    the defendant did not believe the testimony to be true, is
    sufficient to advise the defendant of the charges against him.
    People v. Maestas, 199 Colo. 143, 606 P.2d 849 (1980).</P>
    <P>
    <B>For the sufficiency of indictment in prosecution for
    embezzlement of public property,</B>see People v. Donachy, 196
    Colo. 289, 586 P.2d 14 (1978).</P></ANNO-TEXT>

    <ANNO-TEXT>
    <B>Law reviews.</B>For article, "By Leave of Court First Had",
    see 8 Dicta 14 (June 1931). 
    <P>
    <B>Annotator's note.</B>Since § 16-5-202 is similar to repealed
    § 39-4-4, C.R.S. 1963, § 39-4-4, CRS 53, CSA, C. 48, § 457, and
    laws antecedent thereto, relevant cases construing those
    provisions have been included in the annotations to this
    section.</P>
    <P>
    <B>Purpose of section.</B>The requirement of the signature on
    the information is for the protection of the defendant as a
    guarantee that the prosecution is being conducted in good
    faith. Harris v. Municipal Court, 123 Colo. 539, 234 P.2d 1055
    (1951).</P>
    <P>
    <B>General effect of section.</B>This section means what it
    says and applies it to all informations except where in so
    doing it fails to give the defendant the nature and cause of
    the accusation as required by the constitution. Highley v.
    People, 65 Colo. 497, 177 P. 975 (1918).</P>
    <P>
    <B>This section is not in conflict with the bill of
    rights</B>provision that in criminal prosecutions the accused
    shall have the right to demand the nature and cause of the
    accusation. Jordan v. People, 19 Colo. 417, 36 P. 218
    (1894).</P>
    <P>
    <B>Attorney general has same powers as district
    attorney.</B>The attorney general may subscribe, present, and
    prosecute an information against a public offender with the
    same powers as the district attorney of the proper district.
    People v. Gibson, 53 Colo. 231, 125 P. 531 (1912).</P>
    <P>
    <B>Signature by deputy is proper.</B>Signature of the
    prosecuting officer, typewritten, but followed by the name of
    his deputy, written with his own hand, is a compliance with
    this section. Almond v. People, 55 Colo. 425, 135 P. 783
    (1913).</P>
    <P>
    <B>Additions to special prosecutor's name in information are
    treated as surplusage.</B>Where the district attorney is
    disqualified from prosecuting a case and the court appoints a
    special prosecutor, the prosecutor so appointed is authorized
    to sign an information in the case in his own name, and the
    fact that he placed before his name the name of the district
    attorney and added to his own signature the words "special
    deputy" neither added to, nor detracted from, the proper
    authentication in his own name. The additions are treated as
    surplusage. Williams v. People, 26 Colo. 272, 57 P. 701
    (1899).</P>
    <P>
    <B>Failure to sign information is not jurisdictional,</B>but
    should be pointed out so that the trial court might direct the
    parties to comply with the statute. Harris v. Municipal Court,
    123 Colo. 539, 234 P.2d 1055 (1951).</P>
    <P>
    <B>Phrase "against the peace and dignity" of people.</B>An
    information concluding "against the peace and dignity of the
    same people of the state of Colorado", is in substantial
    conformity with the requirement of the constitution that all
    prosecutions shall be carried on in the name and by the
    authority of the people of the state of Colorado, and conclude
    against the peace and dignity of the same. Holt v. People, 23
    Colo. 1, 45 P. 374 (1896).</P>
    <P>The omission from a criminal information of the concluding
    phrase "and against the peace and dignity of the same" goes to
    matter of form, and in no degree impairs the jurisdiction of
    the court. Chemgas v. Tynan, 51 Colo. 35, 116 P. 1045 (1911);
    People v. Hunter, 666 P.2d 570 (Colo. 1983).</P>
    <P>
    <B>Use of words "feloniously" and "unlawfully".</B>Appellant
    complains that the information does not charge that the accused
    knowingly and wilfully committed the offense. Since the
    information charges the act as "unlawfully and feloniously"
    done, the objection does not affect the real merits. McConnell
    v. People, 73 Colo. 99, 213 P. 674 (1923).</P>
    <P>The use of both the words "unlawfully" and "feloniously" in
    the statute does not require that the former must appear in
    indictment or information if the latter does. Bridge v. People,
    63 Colo. 319, 165 P. 778 (1917).</P>
    <P>
    <B>Separate infractions of same law should be
    distinguished.</B>In every information or indictment charging a
    criminal offense, good pleading required that sufficient facts
    be set forth to identify the crime from another infraction of
    the same law by the same defendant. This would seem essential
    in order to safeguard the accused against a second prosecution
    for the same offense, as well as to acquaint him with what he
    must meet on trial. Bustamante v. People, 136 Colo. 362, 317
    P.2d 885 (1957).</P>
    <P>
    <B>No substitution for section identified as subject of
    prosecution.</B>Where a count of an information in a criminal
    case identifies with particularity the exact section of the
    statute upon which a prosecution is based, no other statute can
    be substituted for the one actually selected as forming the
    subject matter of the prosecution. Skidmore v. People, 154
    Colo. 363, 390 P.2d 944 (1964).</P>
    <P>
    <B>Amendment of minor irregularities only
    permitted.</B>Generally, a criminal complaint or affidavit may
    be amended so as to correct minor irregularities or defects but
    major defects such as a material misnomer of accused or an
    omission of essential allegations cannot be cured by amendment
    on the examination. Bustamante v. People, 136 Colo. 362, 317
    P.2d 885 (1957).</P>
    <P>
    <B>Any conviction based on an information requiring major
    amendment is void,</B>for the court is without jurisdiction.
    Bustamante v. People, 136 Colo. 362, 317 P.2d 885 (1957).</P>
    <P>
    <B>When information fails to charge crime, court acquires no
    jurisdiction.</B>People v. Moore, 200 Colo. 481, 615 P.2d 726
    (1980).</P>
    <P>
    <B>Objections to form of information must be made before trial
    or they are waived.</B>People v. Hunter, 666 P.2d 570 (Colo.
    1983); People v. Joseph, 920 P.2d 850 (Colo. App. 1995); People
    v. Russell, 36 P.3d 92 (Colo. App. 2001).</P>
    <P>
    <B>Authority of district attorney is a technical matter subject
    to waiver.</B>Just as a defendant may waive objections to
    venue, he or she may also waive any objection to the authority
    of the district attorney to bring a criminal charge. People v.
    Joseph, 920 P.2d 850 (Colo. App. 1995).</P>
    <P>
    <B>Even if defendant did not waive objection</B>to the form of
    the information, defendant must demonstrate how any errors
    prejudiced him in order for a defect in the form to dictate
    reversal of a conviction. People v. Russell, 36 P.3d 92 (Colo.
    App. 2001).</P>

    <M>SUFFICIENCY OF INFORMATION.</M></AN-DIV>
    <ANNO-TEXT>
    <B>This section governs the sufficiency of informations in
    criminal cases.</B>Critchfield v. People, 91 Colo. 127, 13 P.2d
    270 (1932). 
    <P>The requisites of information form are set forth by this
    section. Bustamante v. People, 136 Colo. 362, 317 P.2d 885
    (1957).</P>
    <P>
    <B>The sufficiency of an information is not to be determined
    from the evidence.</B>Compton v. People, 84 Colo. 106, 268 P.
    577 (1928).</P>
    <P>
    <B>An information must show the nature and cause of the
    accusation,</B>that is, it must set out the crime charged.
    Jordan v. People, 19 Colo. 417, 36 P. 218 (1894); Bizup v.
    Tinsley, 211 F. Supp. 545 (D. Colo. 1962), aff'd, 316 F.2d 284
    (10th Cir. 1963).</P>
    <P>
    <B>Indictment must clearly state essential facts and answer
    questions of who, what, where, and how.</B>People v. Tucker,
    631 P.2d 162 (Colo. 1981).</P>
    <P>
    <B>Time when offense committed.</B>The general rule is that,
    where time is not a material element of the offense, the
    precise time at which the crime is charged to have been
    committed is not material. Kogan v. People, 756 P.2d 945 (Colo.
    1988).</P>
    <P>If, however, information about the time is necessary to
    enable the defendant to prepare his defense or to guard against
    a subsequent prosecution for the same crime, such information
    must be provided. Kogan v. People, 756 P.2d 945 (Colo.
    1988).</P>
    <P>
    <B>Standard of review for bill of particulars</B>is whether the
    bill of particulars as produced sufficiently informs the
    defendant of the particular charges at issue so that he is
    given a fair opportunity to properly prepare his defense. Kogan
    v. People, 756 P.2d 945 (Colo. 1988).</P>
    <P>
    <B>Bill of particulars held insufficient.</B>Bill of
    particulars which alleged that certain acts had been committed
    sometime during a nine-month period and the absence of any
    accompanying detail describing the defendant's alleged acts
    resulted in clear prejudice to the defendant. Kogan v. People,
    756 P.2d 945 (Colo. 1988).</P>
    <P>
    <B>It must advise defendant of charge.</B>An information is
    sufficient if it advises the defendant of the charge he is
    facing so that he can adequately defend himself and be
    protected from another prosecution for the same offense.
    Digiallonardo v. People, 175 Colo. 560, 488 P.2d 1109 (1971);
    Loggins v. People, 178 Colo. 439, 498 P.2d 1146 (1972); People
    v. Morones, 39 Colo. App. 451, 569 P.2d 336 (1977); People v.
    Albo, 195 Colo. 102, 575 P.2d 427 (1978); People v. Moore, 200
    Colo. 481, 615 P.2d 726 (1980); People in Interest of R.G., 630
    P.2d 89 (Colo. App. 1981); People v. Rubanowitz, 688 P.2d 231
    (Colo. 1984); People v. Chavez, 730 P.2d 321 (Colo. 1986);
    People v. Baker, 45 P.3d 753 (Colo. App. 2001).</P>
    <P>The ultimate test is that an information is sufficient if it
    advises a defendant of the charge he is facing. Edwards v.
    People, 176 Colo. 478, 491 P.2d 566 (1971).</P>
    <P>An information is sufficient if it informs the defendant of
    the charges against him so as to enable him to prepare a
    defense and plead the judgment in bar of any further
    prosecutions for the same offense. People v. Flanders, 183
    Colo. 268, 516 P.2d 418 (1973); People v. Gnout, 183 Colo. 366,
    517 P.2d 394 (1973); People v. Baker, 45 P.3d 753 (Colo. App.
    2001).</P>
    <P>
    <B>And must set forth essential elements of crime.</B>An
    information is sufficient to apprise a defendant of the charge
    he faces if it sets forth the essential elements charging the
    crime. Howe v. People, 178 Colo. 248, 496 P.2d 1040 (1972).</P>
    <P>
    <B>But it need not set out the mode or manner of its
    perpetration,</B>or the instrument or agency employed to
    accomplish the result. Jordan v. People, 19 Colo. 417, 36 P.
    218 (1894); Bizup v. Tinsley, 211 F. Supp. 545 (D. Colo. 1962),
    aff'd, 316 F.2d 284 (10th Cir. 1963).</P>
    <P>
    <B>Information need not specify lesser included
    offenses</B>which may have been committed in commission of the
    described act. People in Interest of R.G., 630 P.2d 89 (Colo.
    App. 1981).</P>
    <P>
    <B>An information is sufficient if it states the offense in
    language that can be easily understood.</B>Whitfield v. People,
    79 Colo. 108, 244 P. 470 (1926).</P>
    <P>
    <B>Or in language of statute defining offense.</B>The
    allegations of an information which follow the language of the
    statute defining the offense are sufficient to satisfy
    constitutional requirements, and the offense charged is set
    forth with such degree of certainty that the court could
    lawfully pronounce judgment upon conviction. Lewis v. People,
    109 Colo. 89, 123 P.2d 398 (1942).</P>
    <P>An information is sufficient if the charge is in the
    language of the applicable statute. People v. Morones, 39 Colo.
    App. 451, 569 P.2d 336 (1977).</P>
    <P>An information is sufficient if the charge is in the
    language of the statute, however, an information need not
    follow the exact wording of the statute. Loggins v. People, 178
    Colo. 439, 498 P.2d 1146 (1972); People v. Russell, 36 P.3d 92
    (Colo. App. 2001).</P>
    <P>
    <B>Or with certainty that will support judgment.</B>Statement
    of offense in the information is sufficient when set forth with
    such degree of certainty that the court may pronounce judgment
    upon a conviction according to the right of the case. Compton
    v. People, 84 Colo. 106, 268 P. 577 (1928).</P>
    <P>
    <B>But information need not furnish such detail as to bar
    further prosecution.</B>An indictment or information need not
    plead an offense in such detail as to be self-sufficient as a
    bar to further prosecution for the same offense, for the
    judgment constitutes the bar. Howe v. People, 178 Colo. 248,
    496 P.2d 1040 (1972).</P>
    <P>
    <B>Information need not include every element of the offense
    that must be proved at trial.</B>Information charging
    possession of marijuana that failed to include "knowing"
    possession nevertheless provided sufficient notice to defendant
    for trial preparation and was adequate to bar further
    prosecution for the same offense. People v. Flockhart, 310 P.3d
    66 (Colo. App. 2009), aff'd in part and rev'd in part, 2013 CO
    42, 304 P.3d 227.</P>
    <P>
    <B>The statutory reference in an information is an immaterial
    part of the information.</B>People v. Marion, 182 Colo. 435,
    514 P.2d 327 (1973).</P>
    <P>
    <B>Incorrect statutory reference not fatal.</B>The incorrect
    citation of a specific statutory reference in an information is
    not grounds for reversal, absent substantial prejudice. People
    in Interest of R.G., 630 P.2d 89 (Colo. App. 1981).</P>
    <P>
    <B>Failure of charges to identify the particular statement or
    assertion alleged to be false is not a fatal
    defect.</B>Information was sufficient to allow defendant to
    prepare a defense, defendant did not object to the charges or
    request a bill of particulars, and defendant did not
    demonstrate or even allege prejudice. People v. Vigil, 251 P.3d
    442 (Colo. App. 2010).</P>
    <P>
    <B>Technical defects in information do not support
    reversal.</B>The supreme court, in accordance with the spirit
    and intent of this section, has consistently refused to reverse
    criminal convictions for technical defects in the information
    or indictment which do not tend to prejudice the substantial
    rights of the defendants on the merits. Helser v. People, 100
    Colo. 371, 68 P.2d 543 (1937); People v. Joseph, 920 P.2d 850
    (Colo. App. 1995).</P>
    <P>If an information is sufficient to state a charge and to
    assure fundamental fairness to a defendant, objections both to
    formal defects and to defects relating to geographical
    deficiencies involving improper venue or to the district

    <P>
    <B>Each count of information must be independent of

    independent of the others and, in itself, charge the defendant
    with a distinct and different offense. People v. Moore, 200

    <P>
    <B>When identity of victim immaterial.</B>While the name of the
    victim of an offense should be alleged in an information,
    failure to do so is an immaterial defect, where the identity of
    the victim is not an essential element of the offense. People

    <B>Omission of such words as "at" or "within" is not
    fatal.</B>The information charged that the defendant "on to wit
    -- the county of Arapahoe", etc. The omission of any
    preposition as "at" or "within" before the name of the county
    was held not to impair the effect of the allegation as to

    <P>
    <B>Charge and information were sufficient, and district court
    had jurisdiction over defendant's case.</B>The information was

    Therefore, the information was not required to also allege that

    <P>An indictment charging that defendant unlawfully,

    <P>
    <B>Unnecessary to allege homicide occurred incident to
    felony.</B>To sustain a conviction for murder in the first
    degree committed in an attempt to perpetrate robbery, it is not
    necessary that the information should allege that the murder
    was committed in an attempt to perpetrate robbery. Andrews v.
    People, 33 Colo. 193, 79 P. 1031 (1905).</P>
    <P>Defendant was convicted of felony murder on an information
    charging that on a certain date, he "did feloniously, wilfully,
    and of his premeditated malice aforethought, kill and murder" a
    named person. Due process was not violated where the
    information contained every essential element demanded by the
    Colorado statutes and by generally approved principles of
    criminal pleading, apprised the defendant of the nature of the
    charge, the date, and the place, described the victim, and
    further alleged that the killing was with malice aforethought,
    but failed to pinpoint the allegation that the homicide
    occurred incident to a known felony. Bizup v. Tinsley, 211 F.

  <M>Furnishing witnesses' names.</M></CATCH-LINE>Whether a
  prosecution is commenced by indictment, information, or felony
  complaint, the district attorney shall make available to the
  defendant not later than twenty-one days after the defendant's
  first appearance at the time of or following the filing of
  charges a written list of the names and addresses of the
  witnesses then known to the district attorney whom he or she
  intends to call upon at trial. The district attorney shall also
  furnish the defendant in writing prior to trial the names and
  addresses of any additional witnesses who have become known to
  him or her prior to trial and whom he or she intends to call upon
  at trial, but this shall not preclude the calling of witnesses
  whose names or the materiality of whose testimony are first
  learned by the district attorney upon the trial. However, the
  court may, in its discretion, enter an order that denies the
  disclosure to the defendant of the names and addresses of
  witnesses, or that requires the defense counsel not to disclose
  such information to the defendant, subject to rule 16 part I
  (d)(2) and part III (d) of the Colorado rules of criminal
  procedure. The names and addresses of witnesses who are the
  subject of the order may be withheld pending a ruling of the
  court, but the prosecution shall notify the defense counsel in
  writing that a motion to withhold witness information has been
  filed and that such information will be withheld pending the
  court's order. Where the defendant has not had or waived a
  preliminary hearing, there shall be filed with the information
  the affidavit of some credible person verifying the information
  upon the personal knowledge of the affiant that the offense was
  committed.</SECTION-TEXT>

    <M>LIST OF WITNESSES.</M></AN-DIV>
    <ANNO-TEXT>
    <B>Purpose of witness list.</B>The requirement of this section
    that the district attorney list his witnesses is to advise the
    defendant of the witnesses for the people and to give the
    defendant an opportunity to contact, examine, and question
    those witnesses. Kelly v. People, 121 Colo. 243, 215 P.2d 336
    (1950). 
    <P>The requirement of listing the names of witnesses is for the
    protection of the defendant as a guarantee that the prosecution
    is being conducted in good faith by the state, and to enable
    the defendant to find out what the testimony against him will
    be, and to investigate the character of the witness against
    him. Harris v. Municipal Court, 123 Colo. 539, 234 P.2d 1055
    (1951).</P>
    <P>
    <B>This section is mandatory,</B>and it is the duty of the
    district attorney to comply with it. Wickham v. People, 41
    Colo. 345, 93 P. 478 (1907).</P>
    <P>
    <B>However, the names of rebuttal witnesses for the people are
    not required to be listed.</B>Ingles v. People, 90 Colo. 51, 6
    P.2d 455 (1931); Schreiner v. People, 95 Colo. 392, 36 P.2d 764
    (1934).</P>
    <P>Neither Crim. P. 16, nor this section specifically require
    the prosecution to endorse or to disclose which of the endorsed
    witnesses it will call for rebuttal. People v. Hamrick, 624
    P.2d 1333 (Colo. App. 1979), aff'd, 624 P.2d 1320 (Colo. 1981);
    People v. Avila, 944 P.2d 673 (Colo. App. 1997).</P>
    <P>
    <B>District attorney may list additional names.</B>It is not
    reversible error to allow, on the day before a case was set for
    trial, the district attorney to list the names of additional
    witnesses said to have been known to him when the information
    was filed, where defendant did not apply for a continuance nor
    make a showing of surprise or prejudice, and where no such
    showing is made on appeal. Wickham v. People, 41 Colo. 345, 93
    P. 478 (1907).</P>
    <P>
    <B>List may be given after arraignment but before witnesses
    testify.</B>It is not error to permit the examination of
    witnesses in chief whose names were not furnished the accused
    prior to his arraignment, a list of such witnesses being given
    before they were called to testify, and no objection being made
    to them upon this ground. Minich v. People, 8 Colo. 440, 9 P. 4
    (1885).</P>
    <P>
    <B>Names of witnesses first learned upon the trial may be
    listed by order of the court.</B>The names of witnesses, the
    materiality of whose testimony is first learned by the district
    attorney upon the trial, may be properly listed by order of
    court. Stone v. People, 71 Colo. 162, 204 P. 897 (1922).</P>
    <P>
    <B>Such permission being discretionary with the
    court.</B>Permission for listing of the names of witnesses at
    the trial is discretionary with the court. Baker v. People, 72
    Colo. 207, 210 P. 323 (1922).</P>
    <P>
    <B>And when granted will not constitute reversible error in the
    absence of a request for a continuance or showing of surprise
    by the defense.</B>Baker v. People, 72 Colo. 207, 210 P. 323
    (1922); Stone v. People, 71 Colo. 162, 204 P. 897 (1922).</P>
    <P>The endorsement of a codefendant as a witness during the
    trial, being in no way prejudicial to the defendant, was not an
    abuse of discretion. Roll v. People, 132 Colo. 1, 284 P.2d 665
    (1955).</P>
    <P>Noncompliance does not require reversal where a continuance
    has not been requested and surprise or prejudice has not been
    shown. People in Interest of B.R.M., 653 P.2d 77 (Colo. App.
    1982).</P>
    <P>
    <B>Failure to list witnesses is not jurisdictional.</B>Failure
    in listing the names of witnesses is not jurisdictional, but
    should be pointed out so that the trial court might direct the
    parties to comply with the statute. Harris v. Municipal Court,
    123 Colo. 539, 234 P.2d 1055 (1951).</P>
    <P>
    <B>Defect may be waived.</B>By failure to timely object to
    noncompliance with section requiring witnesses' names the
    defect is waived. Harris v. Municipal Court, 123 Colo. 539, 234
    P.2d 1055 (1951).</P>
    <P>
    <B>And will not constitute reversible error if
    nonprejudicial.</B>Omission to furnish a defendant with a list
    of witnesses prior to arraignment, where no objection was made
    to such omission at the time of such arraignment, and there is
    no showing of prejudice resulting therefrom, does not
    constitute reversible error. Goldsberry v. People, 149 Colo.
    431, 369 P.2d 787 (1962).</P>
    <P>
    <B>But testimony of unlisted witnesses in chief was erroneously
    admitted.</B>Testimony of witnesses not listed as to the entire
    transaction was not confined to rebuttal matters and was
    erroneously admitted where the district attorney did not learn
    of the existence of the witnesses by anything that occurred at
    the trial. Eckhardt v. People, 126 Colo. 18, 247 P.2d 673
    (1952).</P>

    People, 18 Colo. 217, 32 P. 275 (1893). 
    <P>
    <B>Summons and complaint charging misdemeanor needs no
    verification.</B>This section, which specifically requires
    verification, is to this extent modified by § 16-2-106, which

    charging a misdemeanor and issued by a peace officer. Stubert
    v. County Court, 163 Colo. 535, 433 P.2d 97 (1967).</P>
    <P>
    <B>Where a preliminary hearing has been had, verification upon

    Brown v. People, 20 Colo. 161, 36 P. 1040 (1894).</P>
    <P>
    <B>It is not necessary in such information to set out that a
    preliminary hearing had been had.</B>It devolves upon the
    defendant to establish the same by showing that such
    preliminary hearing had not been had. Brown v. People, 20 Colo.
    161, 36 P. 1040 (1894).</P>
    <P>
    <B>Information need not be verified except in cases in which no

    <P>
    <B>In such cases it must be verified by some person upon his
    own knowledge.</B>Brown v. People, 20 Colo. 161, 36 P. 1040
    (1894).</P>
    <P>Where a verification is necessary, as where a preliminary
    hearing has not been had or waived, it must be contained in the
    independent affidavit of some credible person having knowledge
    of the commission of the offense. White v. People, 8 Colo. App.
    289, 45 P. 539 (1896).</P>
    <P>
    <B>Accused cannot attack truth of affidavit made as basis of
    information.</B>When an affidavit is made as the basis of an
    information in conformity with the requirements of this
    section, it is not in the power of the accused to attack, by
    counteraffidavit or otherwise, the truth of any of its material
    statements. Holt v. People, 23 Colo. 1, 45 P. 374 (1896).</P>
    <P>
    <B>Neither can the statements in the affidavit be attacked by
    extraneous evidence.</B>Whether or not an affidavit upon which
    an information is based complies with this section must be
    determined from the context of the affidavit itself, and its
    statements cannot be attacked by extraneous evidence. The
    verification cannot be attacked on the ground that the
    testimony disclosed that the party who verified it did not have
    personal knowledge of the guilt of the defendant. Bergdahl v.
    People, 27 Colo. 302, 61 P. 228 (1900).</P>
    <P>
    <B>It is unnecessary for the affidavit to recite that affiant
    is a competent witness to testify in the case.</B>His
    competency will be presumed until the contrary appears. Walt v.
    People, 46 Colo. 136, 104 P. 89 (1909); Wilkinson v. People, 86
    Colo. 406, 282 P. 257 (1929); Hubbard v. People, 153 Colo. 252,

    <P>
    <B>Error of failure to verify may be waived.</B>The information
    is required to be verified as designated, but unless the
    objection on that ground is properly presented in the trial
    court it is waived and cannot be raised in the appellate court.
    Bergdahl v. People, 27 Colo. 302, 61 P. 228 (1900).</P>
    <P>The absence of a sufficient affidavit to support a count in
    the information is, at most, an irregularity, and any objection
    thereto must be made before trial. Curl v. People, 53 Colo.
    578, 127 P. 951 (1912); Harris v. Municipal Court, 123 Colo.
    539, 234 P.2d 1055 (1951).</P>
    <P>The affidavit bears the same relation to an information in a
    criminal action that it does to a complaint in a civil action.
    It is no substantial part of either the one or the other, and
    there is no reason why it may not be waived without prejudice
    to any substantial right of the defendant, or why he should not
    be held to have waived any irregularity or defect therein by
    not objecting before pleading to the merits. Curl v. People, 53
    Colo. 578, 127 P. 951 (1912).</P>
    <P>An affidavit is for the benefit of the defendant and want of
    a verification affidavit is waived unless timely objection is

  <M>Witnesses before a grand jury - procedure.</M></CATCH-LINE>(1)
  <N></N>(a)
  <M>Whenever a witness in any proceeding before any grand jury
  refuses, without just cause shown, to comply with an order of the
  court to testify or provide other information, including any
  book, paper, document, record, recording, or other material, the
  prosecuting attorney may submit an application to the court for
  an order directing the witness to show why the witness should not
  be held in contempt. After submission of such application and a
  hearing at which the witness may be represented by counsel, the
  court may, if the court finds that such refusal was without just
  cause, hold the witness in contempt and order the witness to be
  confined. Such confinement shall continue until such time as the
  witness is willing to give such testimony or provide such
  information; however, the court may release the witness from
  confinement if the court determines that further confinement will
  not cause the witness to give such testimony or provide such
  information. No period of such confinement shall exceed the term
  of the grand jury, including extensions, before which such
  refusal to comply with the court order occurred, and in no event
  shall such confinement exceed six months.</M>
  <P N="(1)(b)">(b)
  <M>If a witness has been confined in accordance with paragraph
  (a) of this subsection (1), he or she may, upon petition filed
  with the court, request a hearing to be held within fourteen days
  to review the contempt order at which hearing he or she shall
  have the right to be represented by counsel. The court, at the
  hearing, may rescind, modify, or affirm the order.</M></P>
  <P N="(1)(c)">(c)
  <M>In any proceeding conducted under this section, counsel may be
  appointed for a person financially unable to obtain adequate
  assistance.</M></P>
  <P N="(1.5)(a)">(1.5)
  <N></N>(a)
  <M>Upon verified application of the prosecuting attorney stating
  that a witness was lawfully served with a subpoena to appear and
  testify before the grand jury and that the witness failed to
  appear in accordance with such subpoena, the court shall issue a
  warrant commanding any peace officer to bring the witness without
  unnecessary delay before the court for a hearing on the matters
  set forth in the application and to determine whether the witness
  should be held in contempt pursuant to subsection (1) of this
  section.</M></P>
  <P N="(1.5)(b)">(b)
  <M>Upon issuance of the warrant, the court may fix an appropriate
  bond and direct, as a condition of the bond, that the witness
  appear on a date and at a time certain for the hearing.</M></P>
  <P N="(2)">(2)
  <M>No person who has been imprisoned or fined by a court for
  refusal to testify or provide other information concerning any
  criminal incident or incidents in any proceeding before a grand

  imprisoned or fined for a subsequent refusal to testify or
  provide other information concerning the same criminal incident
  or incidents before any grand jury.</M></P>
  <P N="(3)">(3)
  <M>Upon impanelment of each grand jury, the court shall give to
  such grand jury adequate and reasonable written notice of and
  shall assure that the grand jury reasonably understands the
  nature of:</M></P>

  <M>Its duty to inquire into offenses against the criminal laws of
  the state of Colorado alleged to have been committed;</M></P>

  <P N="(3)(c)">(c)
  <M>Its right to request the production of documents or other
  evidence;</M></P>
  <P N="(3)(d)">(d)
  <M>The subject matter of the investigation and the criminal
  statutes or other statutes involved, if these are known at the
  time the grand jury is impaneled;</M></P>
  <P N="(3)(e)">(e)
  <M>The duty of the grand jury by an affirmative vote of nine or
  more members of the grand jury to determine, based on the
  evidence presented before it, whether or not there is probable
  cause for finding indictments and to determine the violations to
  be included in any such indictments; and</M></P>
  <P N="(3)(f)">(f)
  <M>The requirement that the grand jury may not find an indictment
  in cases of perjury unless at least two witnesses to the same

  <N></N>(a)
  <M>At the option of the prosecuting attorney, a grand jury
  subpoena may contain an advisement of rights. If the prosecuting
  attorney determines that an advisement is necessary, the grand

  jury or to produce books, papers, documents, or other objects
  before such grand jury shall be entitled to assistance of counsel
  during any time that such witness is being questioned in the
  presence of such grand jury, and counsel may be present in the
  grand jury room with his client during such questioning. However,
  counsel for the witness shall be permitted only to counsel with
  the witness and shall not make objections, arguments, or address
  the grand jury. Such counsel may be retained by the witness or
  may, for any person financially unable to obtain adequate
  assistance, be appointed in the same manner as if that person
  were eligible for appointed counsel. An attorney present in the
  grand jury room shall take an oath of secrecy. If the court, at
  an in camera hearing, determines that counsel was disruptive,
  then the court may order counsel to remain outside the courtroom
  when advising his client. No attorney shall be permitted to
  provide counsel in the grand jury room to more than one witness
  in the same criminal investigation, except with the permission of
  the grand jury.</M></P>
  <P N="(4)(e)">(e)
  <M>Once a grand jury has returned a no true bill based upon a
  transaction, set of transactions, event, or events, a grand jury
  inquiry into the same transaction or events shall not be
  initiated unless the court finds, upon a proper showing by the
  prosecuting attorney, that the prosecuting attorney has
  discovered additional evidence relevant to such inquiry.</M></P>
  <P N="(4)(f)">(f)
  <M>An authorized reporter shall be present at all grand jury
  sessions. All grand jury proceedings and testimony from
  commencement to adjournment shall be reported. The reporter's
  notes and any transcripts which may be prepared shall be
  preserved, sealed, and filed with the court. No release or
  destruction of the notes or transcripts shall occur without prior
  court approval.</M></P>
  <P N="(4)(g)">(g)
  <M>Upon application by the prosecutor, or by any witness after
  notice to the prosecutor, the court, for good cause, may enter an
  order to furnish to that witness a transcript of his own grand
  jury testimony, or minutes, reports, or exhibits relating to
  them.</M></P>
  <P N="(4)(h)">(h)
  <M>Any witness summoned to testify before a grand jury, or an
  attorney for such witness with the witness's written approval,
  shall be entitled, prior to testifying, to examine and copy at
  the witness's expense any statement in the possession of the
  prosecuting attorney or the grand jury which such witness has
  made to any law enforcement or prosecution official or under an
  oath required by law that relates to the subject matter under
  inquiry by the grand jury. If a witness is proceeding in forma

  transcript and shall not pay a fee.</M></P>
  <P N="(4)(i)">(i)
  <M>No person subpoenaed to testify or to produce books, papers,
  documents, or other objects in any proceeding before any grand
  jury shall be required to testify or to produce such objects, or
  be confined as provided in this section, for his failure to so
  testify or produce such objects if, upon filing a motion and upon
  an evidentiary hearing before the court which issued such
  subpoena or a court having jurisdiction under this section, the
  court finds that:</M></P>
  <P N="(4)(i)(I)">(I)
  <M>A primary purpose or effect of requiring such person to so
  testify or to produce such objects before the grand jury is or
  will be to secure testimony for trial for which the defendant has
  already been charged by information, indictment, or criminal
  complaint;</M></P>
  <P N="(4)(i)(II)">(II)
  <M>Compliance with a subpoena would be unreasonable or
  oppressive;</M></P>
  <P N="(4)(i)(III)">(III)
  <M>A primary purpose of the issuance of the subpoena is to harass
  the witness;</M></P>
  <P N="(4)(i)(IV)">(IV)
  <M>The witness has already been confined, imprisoned, or fined
  under this section for his refusal to testify before any grand
  jury investigating the same transaction, set of transactions,
  event, or events; or</M></P>
  <P N="(4)(i)(V)">(V)
  <M>The witness has not been advised of his rights as specified in
  paragraph (a) of this subsection (4).</M></P>
  <P N="(4)(j)">(j)
  <M>Any grand jury may indict a person for an offense when the
  evidence before such grand jury provides probable cause to
  believe that such person committed such offense.</M></P>
  <P N="(4)(k)">(k)
  <M>The district court before which the indicted defendant is to
  be tried shall dismiss any indictment of the grand jury if such
  district court finds, upon the filing of a motion by the indicted
  defendant based upon the grand jury record without argument or
  further evidence, that the grand jury finding of probable cause
  is not supported by the record.</M></P>
  <P N="(4)(l)">(l)
  <M>Any person may approach the prosecuting attorney or the grand
  jury and request to testify or retestify in an inquiry before a
  grand jury or to appear before a grand jury. The prosecuting
  attorney or the grand jury shall keep a record of all denials of
  such requests to that prosecuting attorney or grand jury,
  including the reasons for not allowing such person to testify or
  appear. If the person making such request is dissatisfied with
  the decision of the prosecuting attorney or the grand jury, such
  person may petition the court for hearing on the denial by the
  prosecuting attorney or the grand jury. If the court grants the
  hearing, then the court may permit the person to testify or
  appear before the grand jury, if the court finds that such
  testimony or appearance would serve the interests of
  justice.</M></P>
  <P N="(4)(m)">(m)
  <M>The foreman, or acting foreman when designated by the court,
  of the grand jury may swear or affirm all witnesses who come

    of this section reveals that the general assembly intended to
    abolish the established practice of permitting grand jury

    sacrifice the confidentiality of the grand jury proceedings and

    <B>Standards for review of determination of probable
    cause.</B>The district court function in conducting a review of
    the grand jury record, as authorized by subsection (4)(k), is
    much like the role of the court at a preliminary hearing and
    the same rule applies in determining the existence or absence
    of probable cause. The court must draw all inferences in favor
    of the prosecution, and when there is a conflict in the
    testimony a question of fact exists for determination at trial.

    <B>Subsection (4)(k) unambiguously requires a district court to
    dismiss "any indictment" from a grand jury that lacks probable
    cause,</B>including an indictment count that is a sentence
    enhancer. A proceeding under this section is different from a
    preliminary hearing in which the court's authority is limited

    <P>
    <B>In determining whether compliance with subpoena duces tecum

    <B>When evidentiary phase of contempt hearing may be closed to
    public.</B>The evidentiary phase of a grand jury witness's
    contempt hearing may be closed to the public and press only
    upon express findings by the court that: (1) A public hearing
    would create a clear and present danger to the investigation of
    matters presently pending before the grand jury; and (2) the
    prejudicial effect of such information on presently pending
    grand jury matters cannot be avoided by any reasonable
    alternative less drastic than closure. In re P.R. v. District

    <B>Grand jury subpoenas not bona fide where obtained by
    unauthorized persons.</B>Subpoenas for toll records of a
    telephone subscriber were not bona fide grand jury subpoenas
    where they were obtained by investigators of strike force who
    had no authority to represent the state grand jury, and
    therefore toll records so obtained were properly suppressed.

    <P>
    <B>A writ to transport an inmate to a grand jury hearing</B>is

    <P>Term "any witness", as used in subsection (4)(b), means any
    subpoenaed witness who did not receive a written advisement
    upon the subpoena. It does not include a voluntary witness.
    People v. Bergen, 883 P.2d 532 (Colo. App. 1994).</P>
    <P>The right to service of a subpoena bearing an advance

    <P>
    <B>Violation of procedures may warrant dismissal of

    1991); People v. Bergen, 883 P.2d 532 (Colo. App. 1994).</P>
    <P>
    <B>Alleged prosecutorial misconduct held not sufficient to
    warrant dismissal</B>where evidence against defendant was
    strong, unauthorized changes to transcript after return of
    indictment were minor, and review of records and affidavits
    supported trial court's determination that grand jury
    discharged its duty without malice, ill will, fear, or
    favoritism. People v. Bergen, 883 P.2d 532 (Colo. App.
    1994).</P>
    <P>
    <B>No right to evidentiary hearing on issue of off-the-record
    prosecutorial misconduct</B>where evidence presented during
    recorded proceedings was more than sufficient to support the

    comports with the certification and in this instance the trial
    court did not err in permitting the release of a report. In re

  taken into custody, the defendant will flee to avoid prosecution
  or will fail to respond to a summons. The court shall issue a

    <B>Purpose of this section</B>is to allow persons who believe
    that a prosecuting attorney is not pursuing a case with
    diligence to petition the court to review the status of the
    case. Dohaish v. Tooley, 670 F.2d 934 (10th Cir.), cert.
    denied, 459 U.S. 826, 103 S. Ct. 60, 74 L. Ed. 2d 63 (1982). 
    <P>
    <B>This section provides a remedy only for a district
    attorney's refusal to file charges, not for refusal to
    investigate criminal charges.</B>Kailey v. Chambers, 261 P.3d
    792 (Colo. App. 2011).</P>
    <P>
    <B>The scope of appellate court review under this section is a
    mixed question of law and fact.</B>A district court's factual
    findings resulting from an evidentiary hearing may only be
    disturbed if clearly erroneous and not supported by the record.
    However, the district court's application of the statutory
    standard may be reviewed de novo. J.S. v. Chambers, 226 P.3d
    1193 (Colo. App. 2009).</P>
    <P>
    <B>Evidence necessary for judge to substitute judgment.</B>A
    district judge should not, in the absence of clear and
    convincing evidence that the terms of this section have been
    met, substitute his judgment or discretion for that of the
    prosecutor in a criminal case. Tooley v. District Court, 190
    Colo. 468, 549 P.2d 772 (1976).</P>
    <P>The district attorney's decision not to prosecute a case may
    not be challenged unless there is a showing that his decision
    was arbitrary or capricious. People ex rel. Losavio v. Gentry,
    199 Colo. 153, 606 P.2d 57 (1980); Sandoval v. Farish, 675 P.2d
    300 (Colo. 1984).</P>
    <P>District attorney's decision not to prosecute a woman for
    alleged theft by deception was not proved to be arbitrary or
    capricious and without reasonable excuse, and therefore the
    judge could not substitute his judgment or discretion for that
    of the prosecutor. Landis v. Farish, 674 P.2d 957 (Colo.
    1984).</P>
    <P>
    <B>There must be a clear and convincing showing that the
    prosecutor's decision not to prosecute was arbitrary and
    capricious and without reasonable excuse before the court will
    order prosecution or the appointment of a special
    prosecutor.</B>The court's finding that there were credibility
    issues with the alleged victim's claims, the lack of
    specificity regarding the where and when the events occurred,
    and the passage of time show the court's decision was not
    arbitrary and capricious. Kailey v. Chambers, 261 P.3d 792
    (Colo. App. 2011).</P>
    <P>
    <B>The first step for a court to consider is whether a
    prosecuting attorney has made a decision not to
    prosecute.</B>This section requires a refusal to prosecute for
    the inquiry to continue. Kailey v. Chambers, 261 P.3d 792
    (Colo. App. 2011).</P>
    <P>
    <B>Challenging party has the burden of proof and even a strong
    showing does not shift the burden of proof to the
    prosecutor.</B>Moody v. Larsen, 802 P.2d 1169 (Colo. App.
    1990); J.S. v. Chambers, 226 P.3d 1193 (Colo. App. 2009).</P>
    <P>This section provides for a prosecutor's appearance at a
    court-ordered hearing to "explain the refusal" to prosecute.
    The statute does not require the prosecutor to present
    evidence. J.S. v. Chambers, 226 P.3d 1193 (Colo. App.
    2009).</P>
    <P>
    <B>This section calls for the usual type of hearing</B>in which
    both parties are given the opportunity to present evidence and
    argument. Moody v. Larsen, 802 P.2d 1169 (Colo. App. 1990).</P>
    <P>
    <B>Each party has the right to present rebuttal evidence</B>to
    the testimony of a witness concerning a material issue,
    including the right to call witnesses for such purpose. Moody
    v. Larsen, 802 P.2d 1169 (Colo. App. 1990).</P>
    <P>
    <B>Actions brought under this section are special statutory
    proceedings not exempted from application of the rules of civil
    procedure</B>because this section lacks an adequate, exclusive,
    full, and complete procedure. To hold otherwise is to render
    the legislature's mechanism for prevention of prosecutorial
    abuses a hollow shell and is not consonant with sound judicial
    administration. Trial court thus erred in denying challenging
    party's requests for discovery and a continuance to permit
    discovery and in failing to exercise its discretion concerning
    whether to allow discovery. Moody v. Larsen, 802 P.2d 1169
    (Colo. App. 1990).</P>
    <P>
    <B>The amendment to this section in 2000 effectively eliminated
    the right to formal discovery and the right to a full
    evidentiary hearing.</B>Consequently, the trial court may, at
    its discretion, provide for an evidentiary hearing after it has
    considered the petitioner's affidavit, the explanation of the
    district attorney, if required by the court, and any argument
    of the parties. Schupper v. Smith, 128 P.3d 323 (Colo. App.
    2005).</P>
    <P>
    <B>The 2000 amendment also established that this section
    creates a special statutory proceeding that is exempted from
    application of the rules of civil procedure.</B>Schupper v.
    Smith, 128 P.3d 323 (Colo. App. 2005).</P>
    <P>
    <B>This section does not require the court to require the
    prosecuting attorney to appear before the court and explain the
    refusal to prosecute.</B>Kailey v. Chambers, 261 P.3d 792
    (Colo. App. 2011).</P>
    <P>
    <B>This section contemplates that the prosecuting attorney may
    appear in person before the court and explain the refusal to
    prosecute.</B>Schupper v. Smith, 128 P.3d 323 (Colo. App.
    2005).</P>
    <P>
    <B>Under this section, the "prosecuting attorney" is the only
    individual who may be ordered to prosecute a
    case;</B>therefore, dismissal of assistant attorneys from
    proceeding brought under this section is proper. Schupper v.
    Smith, 128 P.3d 323 (Colo. App. 2005).</P>
    <P>
    <B>District attorney's explanation for declining to
    prosecute</B>identified reasons that were supported by some
    competent evidence and were proper factors under Sandoval v.
    Farish, 675 P.2d 300 (Colo. 1984). The district attorney's
    analysis of factors in support of declining prosecution were
    not so overwhelmed by factors that favor prosecution as to
    compel the conclusion that the district attorney's exercise of
    broad discretion was arbitrary and capricious. J.S. v.
    Chambers, 226 P.3d 1193 (Colo. App. 2009).</P></ANNO-TEXT>

  <N></N>(a)
  <M>Every person accused of a class 1, 2, or 3 felony or level 1
  or level 2 drug felony by direct information or felony complaint
  has the right to demand and receive a preliminary hearing within
  a reasonable time to determine whether probable cause exists to
  believe that the offense charged in the information or felony
  complaint was committed by the defendant. In addition, only those
  persons accused of a class 4, 5, or 6 felony by direct
  information or felony complaint which felony requires mandatory
  sentencing or is a crime of violence as defined in section
  18-1.3-406, C.R.S., or is a sexual offense under part 4 of
  article 3 of title 18, C.R.S., shall have the right to demand and
  receive a preliminary hearing within a reasonable time to
  determine whether probable cause exists to believe that the
  offense charged in the information or felony complaint was
  committed by the defendant. The procedure to be followed in
  asserting the right to a preliminary hearing and the time within
  which demand therefor must be made, as well as the time within
  which the hearing, if demanded, shall be had, shall be as
  provided by applicable rule of the supreme court of Colorado. A
  failure to observe and substantially comply with such rule shall
  be deemed a waiver of this right to a preliminary hearing.</M>

  crimes of violence as defined in section 18-1.3-406, C.R.S., or
  which are sexual offenses under part 4 of article 3 of title 18,
  C.R.S., shall have the right to demand or receive a preliminary

  dispositional hearing for the purposes of case evaluation and
  potential resolution.</M></P>
  <P N="(1)(b)(II)">(II)
  <M>Any defendant accused of a class 4, 5, or 6 felony or level 3

  preliminary hearing pursuant to subparagraph (I) of this
  paragraph (b), may demand and shall receive a preliminary hearing
  within a reasonable time pursuant to paragraph (a) of this
  subsection (1), if the defendant is in custody for the offense
  for which the preliminary hearing is requested; except that, upon
  motion of either party, the court shall vacate the preliminary
  hearing if there is a reasonable showing that the defendant has
  been released from custody prior to the preliminary
  hearing.</M></P>
  <P N="(1)(b)(III)">(III)
  <M>The chief justice of the Colorado supreme court is encouraged
  to promulgate rules defining the term "dispositional hearing" for
  purposes of this subsection (1)(b), section 18-1-404 (2), and
  section 19-2.5-609 (2).</M></P>
  <P N="(2)">(2)
  <M>If a person is accused of an unlawful sexual offense
  classified as a felony, upon the request of any party to the
  proceeding, the court may exclude from the preliminary hearing
  any member of the general public. In making a ruling for
  exclusion, the court shall:</M></P>
  <P N="(2)(a)">(a)
  <M>Set forth sufficient findings of fact and conclusions of law
  to support the order; and</M></P>
  <P N="(2)(b)">(b)
  <M>Make its order sufficiently narrow to protect the requesting
  party's compelling interest considering any reasonable
  alternative to exclusion for the entire hearing of all members of
  the general public.</M></P>
  <P N="(3)">(3)
  <M>The court may exempt a victim's advocate from any order
  entered pursuant to subsection (2) of this section. For the
  purposes of this section, "victim's advocate" means any person
  whose regular or volunteer duties include the support of an
  alleged victim of physical or sexual abuse or

    <B>Preliminary hearing does not alter proposition that accused
    entitled to one trial on merits.</B>Although a preliminary
    hearing provides the defendant with an early opportunity to

    <P>
    <B>Standards for determining probable cause at preliminary
    hearing</B>are: (1) Probable cause is established when the
    evidence is sufficient to induce a person of ordinary prudence
    and caution to a reasonable belief that the defendant committed
    the crimes charged; (2) the evidence presented must be viewed
    in the light most favorable to the prosecution; (3) if
    testimony conflicts, the trial court must draw an inference for
    the prosecution; and (4) the preliminary hearing is a screening
    device and not a trial. People v. Williams, 628 P.2d 1011

    <P>
    <B>Judge without jurisdiction to adjudge ultimate guilt.</B>In

    <P>Judging the merits of a case is for the trier of facts at

    People v. District Court, 779 P.2d 385 (Colo. 1989).</P>
    <P>
    <B>Hearsay and other evidence may be bulk of evidence at
    hearing.</B>Hearsay and other evidence, which would be
    incompetent if offered at the time of trial, may be the bulk of
    evidence at a preliminary hearing. People v. Quinn, 183 Colo.
    245, 516 P.2d 420 (1973).</P>
    <P>
    <B>Hearsay evidence considered to establish probable
    cause.</B>Hearsay evidence, which would otherwise be
    inadmissible at the trial, may be considered for purposes of
    establishing probable cause. People v. Williams, 628 P.2d 1011
    (Colo. 1981).</P>
    <P>
    <B>Prosecution satisfies minimum requirements for use of
    hearsay at preliminary hearing if it:</B>(1) Presents some
    competent nonhearsay evidence that addresses an essential
    element of the offense; and (2) presents the hearsay evidence
    through a witness who is connected to the offense or its
    investigation rather than someone merely reading from a report.
    In this case, the prosecution satisfied the status elements of
    the offense through nonhearsay testimony and produced the
    victim's testimony (hearsay) through the investigating officer
    who was familiar with the case. People v. Huggins, 220 P.3d 977
    (Colo. App. 2009).</P>
    <P>
    <B>Court's failure to apply correct standard for use of hearsay
    at preliminary hearing was abuse of discretion.</B>Applying the
    correct standard, the evidence presented at the preliminary
    hearing established probable cause to believe the defendant
    committed the charged offenses. People v. Huggins, 220 P.3d 977
    (Colo. App. 2009).</P>
    <P>
    <B>Resolving admissibility of such evidence.</B>The
    admissibility at a preliminary hearing of a confession which is
    alleged to be involuntary or the admissibility of evidence that
    may have been seized in violation of the fourth amendment to
    the United States Constitution need not be resolved on the same
    basis that would be required when such motion is properly
    before the trial court or at the time of the trial. People v.
    Quinn, 183 Colo. 245, 516 P.2d 420 (1973).</P>
    <P>
    <B>Failure to establish an articulable suspicion</B>for
    stopping defendant or probable cause for arrest at preliminary
    hearing is not grounds for dismissal of charges. People v.
    Brisbin, 727 P.2d 374 (Colo. 1986).</P>
    <P>
    <B>Probable cause finding may be based largely on hearsay
    testimony.</B>Abbott v. County Ct. in &amp; for County of
    Grand, 886 P.2d 730 (Colo. 1994).</P>
    <P>

    abused.</B>Maestas v. District Ct., 541 P.2d 889 (Colo. 1975);
    Abbott v. County Ct. in &amp; for County of Grand, 886 P.2d 730
    (Colo. 1994).</P>
    <P>
    <B>Preliminary hearing deemed waived if not demanded.</B>The
    statutory right to receive a preliminary hearing is not
    absolute and requires that either the defendant or his
    attorney, or the prosecuting attorney, file a written motion
    demanding the preliminary hearing; if the defendant fails to
    file a written motion for a preliminary hearing, he is deemed
    to have waived his right to demand one. People v. Moody, 630
    P.2d 74 (Colo. 1981).</P>
    <P>
    <B>A defendant charged with a class four felony is entitled to
    a preliminary hearing on an offense so long as the defendant is
    in custody for that offense.</B>A defendant who is in custody
    for an unrelated conviction is still in custody for the offense
    for which the preliminary hearing is requested if the defendant
    has not posted bond on those charges. People v. Subjack, 2021
    CO 10, 480 P.3d 114 (overruling People v. Taylor, 104 P.3d 269
    (Colo. App. 2004), and People v. Pena, 250 P.3d 592 (Colo. App.
    2009)).</P>
    <P>
    <B>A defendant charged with a class five felony is conferred
    the right to a preliminary hearing only if that defendant is in
    custody for the offense for which the preliminary hearing is
    requested.</B>The defendant's right to a preliminary hearing is
    lost under the circumstance that he or she is in custody for an
    offense other than that for which the preliminary hearing is
    requested. People v. Taylor, 104 P.3d 269 (Colo. App. 2004),
    overruled in People v. Subjack, 2021 CO 10, 480 P.3d 114.</P>
    <P>
    <B>A defendant who was originally out on bond and then
    rearrested and placed in custody for failing to appear at a
    hearing is entitled to a preliminary hearing</B>while in
    custody for a class 4, 5, or 6 felony. People v. Brothers, 2021
    COA 109M, 498 P.3d 1134.</P>
    <P>
    <B>Refusal to appear constitutes waiver.</B>In addition to an
    express written waiver, refusal by a defendant to appear at a
    scheduled preliminary hearing where the county judge had
    advised the defendant's attorney that the defendant's presence
    was required constitutes an implied waiver and extinguishes the
    defendant's right to a preliminary hearing in county court.
    People v. Abbott, 638 P.2d 781 (Colo. 1981).</P>
    <P>
    <B>As does failure to appear.</B>Where it is clear that a
    defendant was apprised of his right to a hearing and of the
    date on which he was required to appear, the failure of both
    the defendant and his attorney to appear constitutes an implied
    waiver of the preliminary hearing. People v. Abbott, 638 P.2d
    781 (Colo. 1981).</P>
    <P>
    <B>Application for deferred sentencing does not constitute
    waiver of right to preliminary hearing.</B>Celestine v.
    District Court, 199 Colo. 514, 610 P.2d 1342 (1980).</P>
    <P>
    <B>Effect of waiver of preliminary hearing.</B>If the defendant
    elects to waive the preliminary hearing and to proceed to
    trial, the waiver operates as an admission by the defendant
    that sufficient evidence does exist to establish probable cause
    that the defendant committed the crimes charged. People ex rel.
    Farina v. District Court, 184 Colo. 406, 521 P.2d 778
    (1974).</P>
    <P>An express written waiver by a defendant of his right to a
    preliminary hearing operates identically to a failure to file
    within the time limit prescribed by Crim. P. 5(a)(5), both
    requiring the defendant's case to be bound over for trial.
    People v. Abbot, 638 P.2d 781 (Colo. 1981).</P>
    <P>
    <B>Once a county court has bound a defendant over to the
    district court for trial, the district court is without
    authority or power to grant the defendant a preliminary
    hearing.</B>People v. Taylor, 104 P.3d 269 (Colo. App. 2004),
    overruled in People v. Subjack, 2021 CO 10, 480 P.3d 114.</P>
    <P>
    <B>District court cannot restore waived right.</B>Under the
    Colorado rules of criminal procedure and the statutes of this
    state, a district court is not vested with the power to restore
    a defendant's statutory right to a preliminary hearing once the
    defendant had waived that right in county court bind-over
    proceedings. People ex rel. Farina v. District Court, 184 Colo.
    406, 521 P.2d 778 (1974); People v. Abbott, 638 P.2d 781 (Colo.
    1981); People v. Taylor, 104 P.3d 269 (Colo. App. 2004),
    overruled in People v. Subjack, 2021 CO 10, 480 P.3d 114.</P>
    <P>
    <B>Where district court finds that defendant's waiver of right
    to preliminary hearing is ineffective,</B>the district court
    has the authority to restore defendant's right to a preliminary
    hearing. People v. Nichelson, 219 P.3d 1064 (Colo. 2009).</P>
    <P>
    <B>Defendant entitled to a preliminary hearing on all class 1,
    2, or 3 felonies even when the felony classification results
    from a sentence enhancer.</B>People v. Simpson, 2012 COA 156,
    292 P.3d 1153.</P>
    <P>
    <B>Defendant entitled to a preliminary hearing pursuant to
    criteria of subsection (1)(b)(II) for a class 4 felony driving
    under the influence (DUI).</B>Defendant was charged with a
    class 4 felony DUI, not a misdemeanor DUI and a separate
    sentence enhancer. People v. Tafoya, 2019 CO 13, 434 P.3d
    1193.</P>
    <P>
    <B>Defendant who is not in custody entitled to a preliminary
    hearing pursuant to subsection (1)(a) whenever charged with a
    class 4, 5, or 6 felony when felony charge requires the
    imposition of a mandatory period of incarceration.</B>People v.
    Huckabay, 2020 CO 42, 463 P.3d 283.</P>
    <P>Court erred in denying preliminary hearing for defendant
    charged with felony DUI, which requires mandatory sentencing to
    a period incarceration which could include incarceration either
    in the department of corrections or in county jail. People v.
    Huckabay, 2020 CO 42, 463 P.3d 283.</P>
    <P>
    <B>Defendant entitled to a preliminary hearing when special
    offender allegation affects the level of offense defendant is
    accused of and charged with, regardless of whether the special
    offender allegation is deemed an element or a sentence
    enhancer.</B>But sentence enhancer counts that seek solely to
    punish a defendant more severely for committing a crime charged
    in another count do not qualify for a preliminary hearing.
    People v. Vanness, 2020 CO 18, 458 P.3d 901 (overruling People
    v. Garcia, 176 P.3d 872 (Colo. App. 2007)).</P>
    <P>
    <B>Defendant not entitled to preliminary hearing because the
    substantive offense with which defendant was charged was a
    misdemeanor.</B>People v. Garcia, 176 P.3d 872 (Colo. App.
    2007), overruled in People v. Vanness, 2020 CO 18, 458 P.3d
    901.</P>
    <P>The charge of habitual domestic violence offender is a
    sentence enhancer which, if proven, would enhance the level of
    the misdemeanor offense to a class 5 felony and would require
    mandatory sentencing. People v. Garcia, 176 P.3d 872 (Colo.
    App. 2007), overruled in People v. Vanness, 2020 CO 18, 458
    P.3d 901.</P>
    <P>
    <B>Habitual criminal counts.</B>Inasmuch as habitual criminal
    counts do not constitute "offenses", probable cause need not be
    established in the preliminary hearing to bind these charges
    over to the district court. Maestas v. District Court, 189
    Colo. 443, 541 P.2d 889 (1975).</P>
    <P>
    <B>Habitual criminal charges are not substantive offense</B>and
    such a count could be added to a complaint without another
    preliminary hearing. People v. Hodge, 694 P.2d 1277 (Colo. App.
    1984).</P>
    <P>
    <B>Juvenile who was transferred to the district court from the
    juvenile court,</B>after a transfer hearing where probable
    cause as to the offenses charged was determined, was not
    entitled in the district court to another determination of
    probable cause in the form of a preliminary hearing. People v.
    Flanigan, 189 Colo. 43, 536 P.2d 41 (1975).</P>
    <P>
    <B>All evidence presented in a preliminary hearing must be
    viewed in the light most favorable to the prosecution,</B>and
    all inferences must be resolved in favor of the prosecution.
    Abbott v. County Ct. in &amp; for County of Grand, 886 P.2d 730
    (Colo. 1994).</P>
    <P>
    <B>Where technical difficulties prevented defendant from
    obtaining a transcript of the preliminary hearing, the judge
    abused his discretion in denying defendant's motion for a
    second preliminary hearing.</B>Such motion should have been
    granted because the testimony presented at the first
    preliminary hearing was directly relevant and significant to
    defendant's trial preparation, the prosecution was expected to
    rely on testimony presented at the preliminary hearing, and
    there was no alternative method of reconstructing the testimony
    from the preliminary hearing. Harris v. District Court, 843
    P.2d 1316 (Colo. 1993).</P>
    <P>
    <B>District court does not have jurisdiction to review a county
    court's finding of probable cause pursuant to C.R.C.P.

    <P>
    <B>There is no ex post facto violation where the legislature
    extends the statute of limitations period for prosecutions not
    yet time-barred as of the date of the extension.</B>When the
    general assembly enacted subsection (8)(a.5) in July 2001 and
    extended the statute of limitations indefinitely for sexual
    assaults committed after July 1, 1991, that meet the identity
    and reporting criteria of subsection (8)(a.5), prosecution of
    the charges against defendant was not yet time-barred. People
    v. Hicks, 262 P.3d 916 (Colo. App. 2011).</P>
    <P>
    <B>Civil and criminal statutes of limitation
    distinguished.</B>Statutes of limitation in criminal cases
    create a bar to the prosecution, while in civil cases they are
    merely statutes of repose. Bustamante v. District Court, 138
    Colo. 97, 329 P.2d 1013 (1958).</P>
    <P>
    <B>Section limits power of courts to proceed.</B>In criminal
    cases the state has declared it will not prosecute crimes after
    the period has run, hence has limited the power of the courts
    to proceed in the matter as an indictment or information which
    shows on its face that the prosecution of the offense charged
    is barred by limitations. Bustamante v. District Court, 138
    Colo. 97, 329 P.2d 1013 (1958).</P>
    <P>
    <B>The phrase "discovery of the criminal act" means the point
    at which the victim or the state knew or through the exercise
    of reasonable diligence should have known of the facts
    establishing the elements of the crime at issue.</B>People v.
    Cito, 2012 COA 221, 310 P.3d 256.</P>
    <P>
    <B>The time within which an offense is committed is a
    jurisdictional fact</B>in all cases subject to limitation.
    Bustamante v. District Court, 138 Colo. 97, 329 P.2d 1013
    (1958).</P>
    <P>
    <B>Thus, indictment must allege offense within limitation or
    exceptions.</B>The act averred in an indictment must appear to
    have been committed within the period prescribed by the statute
    of limitations or it is necessary to allege the exception that
    relieves it from the bar of the statute of limitations, such as
    that a defendant was a fugitive from justice during all or a
    part of the period of limitation. Bustamante v. District Court,
    138 Colo. 97, 329 P.2d 1013 (1958).</P>
    <P>Exceptions in the statute must be negatived by the people in
    an indictment. Bustamante v. District Court, 138 Colo. 97, 329
    P.2d 1013 (1958).</P>
    <P>
    <B>Otherwise the application of this section is
    automatic</B>whether the crime be a felony or a misdemeanor.
    Bustamante v. District Court, 138 Colo. 97, 329 P.2d 1013
    (1958).</P>
    <P>
    <B>And denies jurisdiction to prosecute offense not within
    period limited.</B>The statute of limitations in a criminal
    case is not merely a defense that may be asserted at a trial as
    in civil matters, but denies jurisdiction to proceed to
    prosecute an offense not committed within the period limited.
    Bustamante v. District Court, 138 Colo. 97, 329 P.2d 1013
    (1958), overruling Packer v. People, 26 Colo. 306, 57 P. 1087

    Thorp v. People, 110 Colo. 7, 129 P.2d 296 (1942).</P>
    <P>Where a misdemeanor indictment contains no allegation of a
    specific offense committed within 18 months of the day the
    indictment was filed, a trial court has no jurisdiction to try
    a defendant on the charge set forth therein. Bustamante v.
    District Court, 138 Colo. 97, 329 P.2d 1013 (1958), overruling
    Packer v. People, 26 Colo. 306, 57 P. 1087 (1899), Wentzel v.
    People, 55 Colo. 33, 133 P. 415 (1913), and Thorp v. People,
    110 Colo. 7, 129 P.2d 296 (1942).</P>
    <P>
    <B>Indictment which fails to allege any date</B>upon which the
    alleged offense was committed does not confer jurisdiction upon
    the trial court to consider the case. People v. Thimmes, 643
    P.2d 780 (Colo. App. 1981).</P>
    <P>
    <B>When a crime is a continuing offense that is perpetrated
    over time, the crime continues, and the statute of limitations
    does not begin to run,</B>as long as the illegal conduct
    continues. People v. Zuniga, 80 P.3d 965 (Colo. App. 2003).</P>
    <P>
    <B>A crime will not be considered a continuing offense unless
    the language of the substantive criminal statute compels such a

    <B>The theft of money was not complete until defendant cashed

    running of the statute of limitations because the "last act"
    constituting theft was negotiation of the check. People v.

    <B>Because felony charges against juvenile were not filed in a

    <B>The 1982 amendment extending the statute of

    for the offense of sexual assault on a child applies to all
    offenses which are not time-barred as of the effective date of
    the amendatory legislation. People v. Whitesell, 729 P.2d 985
    (Colo. 1986).</P>
    <P>
    <B>Statute of limitations as amended in 2002 did not bar
    defendant's prosecution for charge of sexual assault on a child
    by one in a position of trust</B>since the effective date
    clause of the 2002 bill amending the statute did not conflict
    with the bill's substantive amendments. People v. Boston, 214
    P.3d 507 (Colo. App. 2009), overruled in People v. Summers, 208
    P.3d 251 (Colo. 2009).</P>
    <P>
    <B>Flat 10-year statute of limitations applies to felony sex
    offenses allegedly committed against children pursuant to §
    18-3-411 before June 3, 2002,</B>due to an ambiguity created in
    the act enacting the 2002 amendments to § 18-3-411. The general
    statutory construction rule of lenity requires that ambiguity
    in the meaning of a criminal statute must be interpreted in
    favor of the defendant. Thus, effective date section of the
    2002 legislation amending § 18-3-411 and stating that the act
    applies to offenses committed on or after passage of the act
    (June 3, 2002) is controlling despite July 1, 1992 date set
    forth in the substantive provisions of the statute. People v.
    Summers, 208 P.3d 251 (Colo. 2009) (decided based upon §
    18-3-411 as it existed at the time the alleged crimes were
    committed prior to 2006 amendments) (overruling People v.
    Boston, 214 P.3d 507 (Colo. App. 2009)).</P>

    <B>A defendant is absent from the state for statute of

    Butler, 2017 COA 117, 431 P.3d 643.</P>
    <P>
    <B>Applicable limitations period tolled while defendant was
    incarcerated by DOC in another state.</B>Even though defendant
    was sent out of state by the DOC and the DOC maintained
    jurisdiction over him while he was in another state, he was,
    nonetheless, "absent" from the state. The general assembly did
    not include in subsection (2) language contemplating a
    defendant's reason for being out of the state, nor whether the
    defendant was out of the state voluntarily. People v. Butler,
    2017 COA 117, 431 P.3d 643.</P>
    <P>
    <B>Subsection (8)(a.5) eliminates the statute of limitations
    for</B>prosecution of sexual assaults committed after July 1,
    1991, where the defendant's identity is determined in whole or
    in part by his or her DNA and the offense was reported to a law
    enforcement agency within 10 years after the commission of the
    offense. The 10-year statute of limitations in subsection
    (8)(a) remains in effect for any sexual assault committed
    between July 1, 1984, and July 1, 1991, and for sexual assaults
    committed after July 1, 1991, that do not satisfy the statutory
    criteria in subsection (8)(a.5). People v. Hicks, 262 P.3d 916
    (Colo. App. 2011).</P>
    <P>
    <B>Subsection (8)(a.5) does not require that the victim be the

    agency.</B>People v. Shores, 2016 COA 129, 412 P.3d 894.</P>
    <P>
    <B>Subsection (8)(a.5) applies when DNA evidence plays some
    role in establishing a defendant's participation in a sexual
    assault.</B>It is not limited to just when DNA evidence
    "determines" the defendant's identity. The fact that defendant
    was considered a suspect before the DNA results does limit the
    application of subsection (8)(a.5). People v. Sims, 2019 COA
    66, 457 P.3d 719.</P>
    <P>
    <B>Manner of proof.</B>When the bar of the statute of
    limitations is raised by a plea of not guilty, proof must be
    made by the state showing that its right to prosecute and
    punish for the offense alleged is not barred. Where the state's
    own indictment makes the time element material there is no need
    of further proof. It then is merely the duty of a trial court
    to apply the statute and quash the indictment. Bustamante v.
    District Court, 138 Colo. 97, 329 P.2d 1013 (1958).</P>
    <P>
    <B>Prohibition is proper remedy.</B>Where a trial court is
    without jurisdiction to try defendant under an indictment
    showing on its face that prosecution is barred by the statute
    of limitations, prohibition is the proper remedy for relief.
    Bustamante v. District Court, 138 Colo. 97, 329 P.2d 1013

    <P>
    <B>Section applies to offenses relating to banks.</B>Offenses
    denounced by § 11-11-102, relating to receipt of deposits
    during insolvency by banks, are felonies within the three-year
    limitation of this section. People v. Godding, 55 Colo. 579,

    <P>
    <B>Section also applies where felony is charged and lesser
    offense is proved.</B>Where a criminal information charges
    grand larceny, that will not prevent the operation of this
    section where the offense upon conviction proves to be of a
    lesser grade, prosecution for which is barred by the statute.

    <P>
    <B>Defendant's request for a lesser offense instruction
    constituted a waiver of the statute of

    requested a lesser included or nonincluded offense. People v.
    Lowry, 160 P.3d 396 (Colo. App. 2007).</P>
    <P>
    <B>Under subsection (12), a plea of guilty to facilitate the
    disposition of a case constitutes a waiver of the statute of
    limitations.</B>Defendant waived her right to raise the statute
    of limitations as a defense to the amount of restitution
    ordered. People v. Wilson, 251 P.3d 507 (Colo. App. 2010);
    People ex rel. K.W., 2012 COA 151, 317 P.3d 1237.</P>
    <P>
    <B>Subsection (12) applies when the prosecution agreed to allow

    alternative to "facilitate the disposition of the case". People

    <P>
    <B>Section also applies to complaints.</B>The statute of
    limitations governing criminal offenses classed as misdemeanors
    makes specific use of the words "indictment", "information",
    and "complaint". People v. Read, 132 Colo. 390, 288 P.2d 347
    (1955).</P>

    <P>
    <B>Indictment charging embezzlement of public money
    defective.</B>Where an indictment makes a blanket charge of

    <P>
    <B>In rape cases the complaint must state a specific date or
    time when it is alleged the transaction occurred.</B>The
    district attorney may select any act upon which he will rely
    for a conviction, within the period prescribed in this section
    for felonies. Laycock v. People, 66 Colo. 441, 182 P. 880
    (1919).</P>
    <P>In a prosecution for rape where all the acts proved were
    within the statute of limitation, the prosecution had the right
    to select from among them that upon which it would rely for
    conviction; and in the absence of any express election from the
    record it will be presumed that the prosecution elected to
    stand by the offense it first introduced evidence to establish;
    and that evidence of other acts was not introduced to prove
    substantive offenses, but in corroboration and explanation of
    the evidence of the act charged. Mitchell v. People, 24 Colo.
    532, 52 P. 67 (1898); Abbott v. People, 89 Colo. 121, 299 P.
    1053 (1931).</P>
    <P>
    <B>Evidence of acts barred by the statute is
    inadmissible.</B>In a prosecution for rape it was error to
    admit evidence of other acts of sexual intercourse that were
    barred by the statute of limitation. Bigcraft v. People, 30
    Colo. 298, 70 P. 417 (1902).</P>
    <P>It is error to permit the defendant to be cross-examined,

    prosecuting witness occurring more than three years prior to
    the filing of the information. Curtis v. People, 72 Colo. 350,
    211 P. 381 (1922).</P>
    <P>In a prosecution for rape evidence of other acts of sexual
    intercourse with the prosecuting witness, committed within the

    230, 29 P.2d 1035 (1934).</P>
    <P>
    <B>When jury instruction on limitation period
    proper.</B>Instructing the jury that they can find the
    defendant guilty of sexual assault on a child if they find that
    the evidence shows that the crime has occurred at any time
    within three years prior to the filing of the information is
    proper if evidence of only one transaction is admitted and
    there is some question as to the date of the incident. People
    v. Estorga, 200 Colo. 78, 612 P.2d 520 (1980).</P>
    <P>
    <B>Amendment of information at close of evidence was
    permissible</B>where amendment related to acts occurring within
    the statutory limitation period, date of offense was neither a
    material element nor an issue at trial, and the amendment did
    not involve an altered accusation or require a different
    defense strategy from the one defendant had chosen under the
    initial information. People v. Metcalf, 926 P.2d 133 (Colo.
    App. 1996).</P>
    <P>
    <B>The statute of limitations set forth in § 13-80-102,</B>and

    <P>
    <B>General assembly intended the discovery tolling provision of
    the statute of limitations to be applicable to theft committed

    or exclude thefts committed against at-risk adults. People v.
    McKinney, 99 P.3d 1038 (Colo. 2004).</P>
    <P>
    <B>Because the discovery tolling provision of the statute of
    limitations, subsection (4.5)(c), applies to general theft, it
    also includes theft from an at-risk adult,</B>which is an
    enhanced form of general theft. Accordingly, the period within
    which a prosecution for theft against an at-risk adult must be
    commenced does not begin to run until the time the victim

    <P>
    <B>The doctrine of laches is applicable to persons convicted of

    class one felonies in subsection (1) is because the general
    assembly determined that it would be inappropriate to establish
    a fixed period for post-conviction motions for the most serious
    offenses. Such a legislative determination does not manifest a
    clear intent to deprive courts of their preexisting ability to
    apply the doctrine of laches to class one felony cases. Trial
    courts may continue to assess individually whether equitable
    considerations should preclude post-conviction relief when a
    defendant has been convicted of a class one felony. People v.

    <P>
    <B>This section violates due process</B>of law under the
    federal and state constitutions because it precludes collateral
    challenges to the constitutional admissibility of prior
    convictions in pending prosecutions solely on the basis of a
    time bar, without providing the defendant an opportunity to
    show that the failure to assert a timely constitutional
    challenge was the result of circumstances amounting to
    justifiable excuse or excusable neglect. People v. Leonard, 673

    <P>
    <B>Constitutionality.</B>The construction that this section
    applies to postconviction challenges to criminal convictions

    protections of habeas corpus, separation of powers, due
    process, or equal protection of the laws. People v. Wiedemer,

    <P>The application of this section to bar a motion to challenge
    a prior conviction in an unrelated proceeding does not violate
    the constitution. The justifiable excuse or excusable neglect
    exception in subsection (2)(d) provides a defendant with a

    convictions. People v. Deskins, 904 P.2d 1358 (Colo. App.

    <P>
    <B>Defendant lacks standing to challenge
    constitutionality</B>of § 16-5-402 based on the argument that
    subsection (3) violates due process because subsection (3) is
    severable from the other provisions of this section that are
    directly implicated, subsection (3) has no application to the
    present proceeding, and the defendant failed to show he is
    effected by the alleged unconstitutionality of subsection (3).
    It is best to defer validity of subsection (3) until the issue

    People v. Wiedemer, 852 P.2d 449 (Colo. 1993); People v.
    Clouse, 74 P.3d 336 (Colo. App. 2002).</P>
    <P>The trial court may rely on the plea agreement or the plea
    hearing transcript in denying a Crim. P. 35(c) motion without a
    hearing on timeliness grounds even though a defendant is not
    required to provide evidentiary support for his allegations
    regarding justifiable excuse or excusable neglect. People v.
    Alvorada Hinojos, 2019 CO 60, 444 P.3d 755. But see People v.
    Chavez-Torres, 2019 CO 59, 442 P.3d 843.</P>
    <P>Whether a defendant has demonstrated justifiable excuse or
    excusable neglect is a question of fact to be resolved by the
    trial court, whose ruling is not to be overturned if the record
    supports its findings. People v. Ambos, 51 P.3d 1070 (Colo.
    App. 2002).</P>
    <P>Justifiable excuse and excusable neglect exception was
    adopted for the specific purpose of preventing an
    unconstitutional result of the statute being applied in a
    manner that would violate due process of law. People v.
    Heitzman, 852 P.2d 443 (Colo. 1993).</P>
    <P>Implicit in any finding that the statutory exception is not
    satisfied in a particular case is the conclusion that, acting
    as a bar to a defendant's claims, the statute is not
    unconstitutional as applied. People v. Heitzman, 852 P.2d 443
    (Colo. 1993).</P>
    <P>
    <B>This section is applicable to postconviction remedies filed
    pursuant to Crim. P. 35;</B>accordingly, a defendant must be
    given an opportunity to present evidence of justifiable excuse
    or excusable neglect when a court raises the time limitation of
    this section sua sponte. People v. Lanford, 867 P.2d 50 (Colo.
    App. 1993).</P>
    <P>
    <B>The limitations of this section are applicable to a
    proportionality review</B>of a sentence imposed pursuant to the
    habitual criminal statutes. People v. Talley, 934 P.2d 859
    (Colo. App. 1996).</P>
    <P>
    <B>Request for proportionality review</B>alleging that sentence
    violates the eighth amendment to the U.S. constitution is
    subject to the limitation period set forth in this section.
    People v. Moore-El, 160 P.3d 393 (Colo. App. 2007).</P>
    <P>
    <B>For the purpose of this section, the word
    "conviction"</B>includes the recital of the plea, the verdict
    or findings, the sentence, the finding of the amount of
    presentence confinement, and costs. People v. Lanford, 867 P.2d
    50 (Colo. App. 1993).</P>
    <P>
    <B>Justifiable excuse or excusable neglect.</B>The "excusable
    neglect" exception to this section cannot be read so broadly
    that the statutory limitation becomes meaningless. In this
    instance, the failure to attack the prior conviction within the
    time period allowed by this section and the grace period was
    not justified just because the defendant had no present need to
    attack the conviction until the habitual offender charges were
    filed. People v. Stephens, 837 P.2d 231 (Colo. App. 1992),
    cert. dismissed, 854 P.2d 231 (Colo. 1993); People v. Boehmer,
    872 P.2d 1320 (Colo. App. 1993).</P>
    <P>
    <B>"Excusable neglect" not found.</B>No excusable neglect
    existed where defendant claimed he was unable to appeal because
    he was under the influence of a drug during appeal period, but
    made no reasonable effort to appeal once free from that
    influence. People v. Fultz, 761 P.2d 242 (Colo. App. 1988).</P>
    <P>Defendant's claim that he had not challenged previous
    convictions until habitual criminal charges were filed because
    he had no present need not excusable neglect. People v.
    Mershon, 844 P.2d 1240 (Colo. App. 1992), aff'd, 874 P.2d 1025
    (Colo. 1994); People v. Boehmer, 872 P.2d 1320 (Colo. App.
    1993); People v. Penrod, 892 P.2d 383 (Colo. App. 1994).</P>
    <P>Defendant's recent discovery of a legal basis for a
    collateral attack on his conviction based on the provisions of
    § 16-14-102 did not constitute excusable neglect where he had
    not otherwise demonstrated some unavoidable hindrance that
    would have caused a reasonably prudent person to neglect to
    pursue timely collateral relief. The alleged ineffective
    assistance of counsel also did not excuse his delay. People v.
    Slusher, 43 P.3d 647 (Colo. App. 2001).</P>
    <P>Lack of funds while incarcerated does not qualify as
    justifiable excuse or excusable neglect. People v. Merchant,
    983 P.2d 108 (Colo. App. 1999).</P>
    <P>Defendant's indigence, ignorance of the law, and lack of
    legal counsel do not amount to justifiable excuse or excusable
    neglect. Further, the trial court gave no credence to
    defendant's claim that his counsel failed to advise him of his
    postconviction rights, since defendant immediately filed a
    motion to withdraw his plea when a sentence to the department
    of corrections was imminent. People v. McPherson, 53 P.3d 679
    (Colo. App. 2001).</P>
    <P>
    <B>No justifiable excuse or excusable neglect</B>where
    defendant did not raise a direct appeal or collateral attack of
    his Virginia conviction until almost 14 years after his
    conviction had entered. People v. Landis, 9 P.3d 1165 (Colo.
    App. 2000).</P>
    <P>No justifiable excuse or excusable neglect where defendant
    waited nine years from the date conviction became final to file
    collateral attack challenging its validity. People v. Jackson,
    98 P.3d 940 (Colo. App. 2004).</P>
    <P>No justifiable excuse or excusable neglect where defendant
    asserted he or she could not file a second motion until the
    first postconviction proceedings were concluded. People v.
    Silva, 131 P.3d 1082 (Colo. App. 2005), aff'd in part and rev'd
    in part on other grounds, 156 P.3d 1164 (Colo. 2007).</P>
    <P>No justifiable excuse or excusable neglect where defendant
    waited to file his Crim. P. 35(c) motion until he could
    accumulate an "unassailable mass" of research studies. The
    studies cited by defendant, unapplied academic theories, did
    not constitute evidence, let alone new evidence, for purposes
    of his motion. People v. Bonan, 2014 COA 156, 357 P.3d 231.</P>
    <P>No justifiable excuse or excusable neglect when defendant
    based his claims on ongoing incompetency, disability, and lack
    of sufficient mental faculties that resulted in a complete
    inability to process the unconstitutionality of his conviction,
    leading him not to investigate or timely pursue post-conviction
    relief, but defendant had multiple competency evaluations and
    was found competent to proceed both before he entered his plea
    and before he was sentenced. People v. Worosello, 2019 COA 166,
    463 P.3d 308.</P>
    <P>
    <B>Defendant's motion was untimely filed with no justifiable
    excuse,</B>because, even though she commenced her collateral
    attack with a motion filed within the three-year period, that
    motion was denied and defendant did not appeal the denial. A
    subsequent motion, filed after the three-year period, could not
    be considered as relating back to the original motion. People
    v. Cummins, 37 P.3d 507 (Colo. App. 2001).</P>
    <P>
    <B>Ineffective assistance of counsel in Crim. P. 35(c)
    proceedings is colorable grounds for appointment of
    conflict-free counsel and a trial court hearing on justifiable
    excuse and excusable neglect.</B>The allegation that
    postconviction counsel failed to inform the court of the
    constitutional limitations of defendant's sentence, which in
    turn resulted in a sentence twice the constitutionally
    permissible level, is within the standard for measuring
    ineffective assistance of counsel under Strickland v.
    Washington, 466 U.S. 668 (1984). Close v. People, 180 P.3d 1015
    (Colo. 2008).</P>
    <P>
    <B>Justifiable excuse or excusable neglect would be
    established</B>if the public defender's conflict of interest
    was the reason for not filing a motion for post-conviction
    relief on behalf of defendant. People v. Chang, 179 P.3d 240
    (Colo. App. 2007).</P>
    <P>
    <B>Justifiable excuse or excusable neglect would be
    established</B>if the public defender's failure to file a
    motion for post-conviction relief on behalf of defendant was
    the result of ineffective counsel. People v. Chang, 179 P.3d
    240 (Colo. App. 2007).</P>
    <P>
    <B>Because there is no requirement that appellate counsel
    advise a defendant of time limitations for seeking
    postconviction relief, the absence of such advice is not a
    justifiable excuse for defendant's neglect.</B>People v.
    Alexander, 129 P.3d 1051 (Colo. App. 2005).</P>
    <P>
    <B>Defendant's misplaced reliance on parole board's
    interpretation of law</B>concerning parole decisions for sex
    offenders did not constitute justifiable excuse or excusable
    neglect to attack conviction outside of three-year period.
    People v. Perez, 895 P.2d 1090 (Colo. App. 1994).</P>
    <P>
    <B>A defendant's intentional abandonment of claims raised at an
    earlier proceeding does not amount to justifiable excuse or
    excusable neglect</B>that would permit a late filing of a
    postconviction motion. People v. Abeyta, 923 P.2d 318 (Colo.
    App. 1996).</P>
    <P>
    <B>Ineffective assistance of counsel can constitute justifiable
    excuse or excusable neglect.</B>People v. Valdez, 178 P.3d 1269
    (Colo. App. 2007).</P>
    <P>
    <B>Mere failure to challenge a conviction</B>does not establish
    ineffective assistance of counsel nor constitute excusable
    neglect or justifiable excuse. People v. Boehmer, 872 P.2d 1320
    (Colo. App. 1993); People v. Penrod, 892 P.2d 383 (Colo. App.
    1994); People v. Rhorer, 946 P.2d 503 (Colo. App. 1997), rev'd
    on other grounds, 967 P.2d 147 (Colo. 1998).</P>
    <P>
    <B>As a matter of law, postconviction counsel's seven-year
    delay in filing a supplemental motion in a challenge that was
    filed within the time limits prescribed by this section was, in
    light of all the circumstances, outside the wide range of
    professionally competent assistance.</B>People v. Valdez, 178
    P.3d 1269 (Colo. App. 2007).</P>
    <P>
    <B>It is appropriate for a trial court to raise the issue sua
    sponte of whether a defendant's motion for post-conviction
    relief is untimely</B>under this section. People v. Xiong, 940
    P.2d 1119 (Colo. App. 1997).</P>
    <P>
    <B>If a defendant's motion for post-conviction relief is
    untimely, the trial court may deny the motion without
    conducting a hearing</B>if the defendant has failed to allege
    facts which, if true, would establish justifiable excuse or
    excusable neglect. People v. Xiong, 940 P.2d 1119 (Colo. App.
    1997).</P>
    <P>
    <B>The timely commencement of a collateral attack fails to toll
    the limitations period with respect to additional
    postconviction claims</B>not contained in the timely filed
    motion. People v. Ambos, 51 P.3d 1070 (Colo. App. 2002).</P>
    <P>
    <B>For purposes of this section and postconviction review, a
    "conviction" occurs when</B>the trial court enters judgment and
    sentence is imposed, if there is no appeal; if an appeal is
    pursued, then the conviction is not final until the appellate
    process is exhausted. People v. Hampton, 857 P.2d 441 (Colo.
    App. 1992), aff'd, 876 P.2d 1236 (Colo. 1994); People v.
    Clouse, 74 P.3d 336 (Colo. App. 2002).</P>
    <P>Where a defendant initiates a direct appeal from a
    conviction, this section's three-year limitations period does
    not begin to run until the appeal is exhausted; tolling of the
    period is not warranted during the pendency of an appeal from
    the denial of a Crim. P. 35(c) motion. People v. Ambos, 51 P.3d
    1070 (Colo. App. 2002).</P>
    <P>
    <B>Direct appeal not reinstated extending the time periods of
    this section.</B>When, under a Crim. P. 35 motion,
    post-conviction court appoints counsel to pursue any error in
    the original appeal, it is not reinstating defendant's direct
    appeal. People v. Shepard, 151 P.3d 580 (Colo. App. 2006).</P>
    <P>
    <B>Resentencing, upon revocation of probation or rejection from
    community corrections, does not create a new
    "conviction".</B>The statutory sentencing scheme, under which a
    defendant who receives probation may subsequently have his or
    her probation revoked and receive a sentence to community
    corrections or to the department of corrections, contemplates a
    system of escalating sentencing alternatives available to the
    court. Hence, resentencing after a revocation of probation or a
    rejection from community corrections does not result in the
    entry of a new judgment of conviction for purposes of this
    section. People v. McPherson, 53 P.3d 679 (Colo. App.
    2001).</P>
    <P>
    <B>The date of conviction for purposes of this section is the
    date the appeal is exhausted,</B>not the date of the amended
    mittimus reflecting the reduction of sentence, where a Crim. P.
    35(b) motion has been filed and granted after the conclusion of
    a direct appeal. People v. Metcalf, 979 P.2d 581 (Colo. App.
    1999).</P>
    <P>
    <B>The date of resentencing, after defendant violated the
    conditions of her probation, does not trigger the commencement
    of a new three-year period for collateral attack.</B>Even
    though a Crim. P. 35(b) motion was filed within three years
    after the defendant was sentenced to the department of
    corrections for violation of her conditions of probation, the
    motion was untimely because it was filed more than three years
    after the date the judgment of conviction was entered. People
    v. Cummins, 37 P.3d 507 (Colo. App. 2001); People v. Collier,
    151 P.3d 668 (Colo. App. 2006).</P>
    <P>
    <B>Subsection (1.5) is discretionary</B>and a court may elect
    to address a defendant's claims on the merits. People v.
    Kilgore, 992 P.2d 661 (Colo. App. 1999).</P>
    <P>
    <B>Applied</B>in People v. Smith, 856 P.2d 26 (Colo. App.

    <ANNO-TEXT>
    <B>Annotator's note.</B>Since § 16-6-101 is similar to repealed
    laws antecedent to CSA, C. 170, § 3, relevant cases construing
    those provisions have been included in the annotations to this
    section. 
    <P>
    <B>The object of this section</B>is to secure to a party
    charged with crime a fair and impartial trial by a jury in a
    county uninfluenced by local bias or prejudice. People ex rel.
    Burke v. District Court, 60 Colo. 1, 152 P. 149 (1915).</P>
    <P>
    <B>To support a request for a change of venue, a defendant must
    establish one of two circumstances.</B>First the defendant can
    show that the pretrial publicity is so massive, pervasive, and
    prejudicial as to create a presumption that the defendant will
    be denied a fair trial. Alternatively, the defendant can
    demonstrate that any pretrial publicity will create actual
    prejudice and hostility in the jury panel. The defendant must
    show actual prejudice -- a nexus between pretrial publicity and
    a panel of partial jurors. People v. Hankins, 2014 COA 71, 361
    P.3d 1033.</P>
    <P>Pretrial publicity was extensive, but not so massive,
    pervasive, and prejudicial as to create a presumption that
    defendant was denied a fair trial. People v. Hankins, 2014 COA
    71, 361 P.3d 1033.</P>
    <P>Record did not show actual prejudice. Only one impaneled
    juror said he had formed an opinion, and he adamantly declared
    that he could set it aside. People v. Hankins, 2014 COA 71, 361
    P.3d 1033.</P>
    <P>
    <B>The denial of a fair trial may be presumed when pretrial
    publicity is massive, pervasive, and prejudicial.</B>People v.
    Simmons, 183 Colo. 253, 516 P.2d 117 (1973).</P>
    <P>
    <B>Prejudice must exist in all of several attached
    counties.</B>Where several counties are attached for judicial
    purposes, a petition for change of venue, founded upon
    prejudice of the inhabitants must show that such prejudice
    exists in all of the counties so attached. Fitzgerald v.
    People, 1 Colo. 56 (1867).</P>
    <P>
    <B>Motion for change of venue properly denied.</B>Motion for
    change of venue on ground that pretrial publicity made fair
    trial impossible was properly denied where the voir dire amply
    demonstrated the absence of prejudice and the ability of the
    jurors to set aside any opinions that they may have received
    from the news media. People v. Medina, 185 Colo. 101, 521 P.2d
    1257 (1974).</P>
    <P>Trial court did not abuse its discretion in denying the
    change of venue where the trial court noted that media coverage
    of the crime was balanced and was not sensational and that some
    newspaper articles expressed sympathy for the defendant.
    Further as a result of the court's voir dire examination of the
    prospective jurors concerning the effect of publicity, jurors
    who expressed knowledge of the case were either excused for
    cause or expressed an ability to put aside any opinions they
    had formed about the case. People v. Dore, 997 P.2d 1214 (Colo.
    App. 1999).</P>
    <P>
    <B>When juror's assurances of impartiality not
    conclusive.</B>Where a defendant demonstrates the existence of
    a pattern of deep and bitter prejudice throughout the community
    where he is to be tried, a juror's assurance that he will be
    fair and impartial is not conclusive. People v. Botham, 629

    § 39-9-5, C.R.S. 1963, § 39-9-5, CRS 53, CSA, C. 170, § 4, and
    laws antecedent thereto, relevant cases construing those
    provisions have been included in the annotations to this
    section. 
    <P>
    <B>This section is mandatory upon the court only when the party
    applying for change has brought himself within its
    provisions.</B>Roberts v. People, 9 Colo. 458, 13 P. 630
    (1886).</P>
    <P>
    <B>Decision on motion is discretionary.</B>The question of
    prejudice of inhabitants rests in the discretion of the court.
    The decision will not be disturbed unless an abuse of
    discretion appears. Erbaugh v. People, 57 Colo. 48, 140 P. 188
    (1914); People v. Coit, 961 P.2d 524 (Colo. App. 1997).</P>
    <P>A second application in the same cause, for change of venue,
    is addressed to the discretion of the court, and error cannot
    be assigned upon refusal to grant it. Fitzgerald v. People, 1
    Colo. 56 (1867).</P>
    <P>The granting or refusal of a motion for change of venue is a
    matter lodged in the discretion of the trial court and, in the
    absence of an abuse of such discretion, will not be disturbed.
    Corbett v. People, 153 Colo. 457, 387 P.2d 409 (1963), cert.
    denied, 377 U.S. 939, 84 S. Ct. 1346, 12 L. Ed. 2d 302
    (1964).</P>
    <P>A motion for a change of venue due to local prejudice is a
    matter of judicial discretion. People v. Simmons, 183 Colo.
    253, 516 P.2d 117 (1973).</P>
    <P>
    <B>And decision will not be reversed except where discretion is
    abused.</B>In passing upon an application for a change of venue
    on the ground of prejudice of the inhabitants, the trial court
    should exercise a sound discretion; it is only in case of
    manifest abuse of such discretion that its decision will be
    reversed by the supreme court. Power v. People, 17 Colo. 178,
    28 P. 1121 (1892).</P>
    <P>The finding of the court on a controversy under this section
    is conclusive on all if he had the right conception of the law,
    and his conclusions are supported by the evidence or fair
    deductions therefrom. People ex rel. Burke v. District Court,
    60 Colo. 1, 152 P. 149 (1915).</P>
    <P>
    <B>Trial court acted within its discretion by only partially
    granting a motion to change venue</B>by moving the trial to a
    different county rather than a different judicial district.
    People v. Coit, 961 P.2d 524 (Colo. App. 1997).</P>
    <P>
    <B>The motion must set forth the ground upon which the venue
    may be changed,</B>and also the facts which lead to the belief
    that such ground exists. Solander v. People, 2 Colo. 48
    (1873).</P>
    <P>
    <B>Affiant may state grounds of belief that prejudice
    exists.</B>On motion for change of venue, affiant in a
    supporting affidavit is entitled to state the grounds of his
    belief that defendant would not receive a fair trial by reason
    of prejudice of the inhabitants. Glasson v. Bowen, 84 Colo. 57,
    267 P. 1066 (1928).</P>
    <P>
    <B>And facts should be sufficient to inform judge of causes
    relied on.</B>The law contemplates that upon application for
    change of venue, facts shall be stated sufficient to inform the
    judge of the nature of the causes for the change, and their
    alleged foundation. Hughes v. People, 5 Colo. 436 (1880).</P>
    <P>
    <B>To support a request for a change of venue, a defendant must
    establish one of two circumstances.</B>First the defendant can
    show that the pretrial publicity is so massive, pervasive, and
    prejudicial as to create a presumption that the defendant will
    be denied a fair trial. Alternatively, the defendant can
    demonstrate that any pretrial publicity will create actual
    prejudice and hostility in the jury panel. The defendant must
    show actual prejudice -- a nexus between pretrial publicity and
    a panel of partial jurors. People v. Hankins, 2014 COA 71, 361
    P.3d 1033.</P>
    <P>
    <B>Prejudice of the inhabitants presents a question of fact
    triable by the court.</B>Erbaugh v. People, 57 Colo. 48, 140 P.
    188 (1914).</P>
    <P>The trial judge necessarily passes upon the question in
    controversy as a matter of fact. People ex rel. Burke v.
    District Court, 60 Colo. 1, 152 P. 149 (1915).</P>
    <P>
    <B>Attack of denial of motion is by appeal.</B>If appellant
    desires to attack the validity of the ruling on his motion for
    change of venue because he could not receive a fair and
    impartial jury, he should proceed to a jury trial and then
    appeal if the result returned is unfavorable to him. Brisbin v.
    Schauer, 176 Colo. 550, 492 P.2d 835 (1971).</P>
    <P>
    <B>Means to insure fair trial not appellate
    concern.</B>Regardless of the means imposed by the trial judge
    to insure the accused's constitutional right to a fair trial by
    a panel of impartial jurors, the critical inquiry on appellate
    review is whether the chosen means did in fact preserve the
    accused's right to a fair trial. People v. Botham, 629 P.2d 589
    (Colo. 1981).</P>
    <P>
    <B>Reviewing court may look to voir dire.</B>In determining
    whether a trial court abuse its discretion in denying a motion
    for a change of venue because of alleged local prejudice, the
    reviewing court may quite properly look at what occurred upon
    voir dire examination of the prospective jurors. Corbett v.
    People, 153 Colo. 457, 387 P.2d 409 (1963), cert. denied, 377
    U.S. 939, 84 S. Ct. 1346, 12 L. Ed. 2d 302 (1964).</P>
    <P>
    <B>Insufficient ground for change.</B>The fact that the
    deceased was a banker and citizen of high standing in the
    community is not in itself a ground for change of venue in a
    murder case. Corbett v. People, 153 Colo. 457, 387 P.2d 409
    (1963), cert. denied, 377 U.S. 939, 84 S. Ct. 1346, 12 L. Ed.
    2d 302 (1964).</P>
    <P>
    <B>Prejudice of jury moot if defendant elects trial to the
    court.</B>By electing to try the case to the court, appellant
    was foreclosed from asserting error in the denial of a change
    of venue. His contention in presenting his motion for a change
    of venue was that he could not obtain trial by a fair and
    impartial jury in the district in which he was proceeding.
    Nowhere did he complain that he could not obtain a fair trial
    before the trial judge. Under such circumstances, the issue of
    whether the change of venue should have been granted became
    moot. Brisbin v. Schauer, 176 Colo. 550, 492 P.2d 835
    (1971).</P>
    <P>
    <B>No error in failure to grant change of venue.</B>People v.

  <M>Any person charged with crimes in more than one county of this

  to be charged with all crimes so that he may enter into a

  <P N="(2)">(2)

  a copy of the information to the district attorney of each other
  county in which the defendant stands charged, together with a
  statement that the defendant has applied to enter into a
  disposition in the county of application. Upon receipt of the
  information and statement, the district attorney of the other
  county may execute a consent in writing allowing the defendant to
  enter a plea of guilty in the county to which application has
  been made to the crime charged in the information and committed
  in the other county and send it to the district attorney who
  prepared the information.</M></P>
  <P N="(3)">(3)
  <M>If necessary, the district attorney shall amend the

  has received written consent from the district attorney of other
  counties, and he shall file the information in any court of his
  county having jurisdiction to try or accept a plea of guilty to
  the most serious crime alleged therein. The defendant then may
  enter a plea of guilty to all offenses alleged to have been
  committed in the county where the court is located and to all
  offenses alleged to have been committed in other counties as to
  which consents have been executed pursuant to subsection (2) of
  this section. Before entering his plea of guilty, the defendant
  shall waive in writing any right to be tried in the county where
  the crime was committed. The district attorney of the county
  where the crime was committed need not be present when the plea
  is made, but his written consent shall be filed with the
  court.</M></P>
  <P N="(4)">(4)
  <M>Thereupon the court shall enter such judgment, the same as if

  pleaded guilty under this section.</M></P>
  <P N="(5)">(5)
  <M>The clerk of the court in the county where the plea is made
  shall file a copy of the judgment of conviction with the clerk in
  each county where a crime covered by the plea was committed. The
  district attorney in each of said counties shall then move to
  dismiss any charges covered by the plea of guilty which are
  pending against the defendant in his county, and the same shall
  thereupon be dismissed.</M></P></SECTION-TEXT>

    (Colo. 1981).</P>
    <P>The facts will vary in accordance with the peculiar
    situation pertaining, but, as a general rule, sufficient
    factual matters must be stated to show bias and prejudice on
    the part of the trial judge to the extent that it may
    reasonably and substantially appear that his actions during the
    course of trial will be so influenced against defendant that a
    fair and impartial trial may not result. Walker v. People, 126
    Colo. 135, 248 P.2d 287 (1952).</P>
    <P>
    <B>And it exists if case is decided on considerations not
    connected with facts.</B>In any law suit where the issues
    involved are not determined alone from considerations that
    belong to them, there is prejudice within the meaning of the
    law, and such prejudice is necessarily against the party
    injured. People ex rel. Burke v. District Court, 60 Colo. 1,
    152 P. 149 (1915).</P>
    <P>
    <B>Where no basis for disqualification.</B>In the context of a
    confidential plea-bargaining conference, conducted
    off-the-record and in chambers, and where the challenged
    statement by the court implies nothing more than the judge's
    belief that the proposed plea and sentence concessions would
    not do justice, there is no basis for disqualification. Sober
    v. District Court, 197 Colo. 250, 592 P.2d 400 (1979).</P>
    <P>
    <B>It is not based upon judge's view of law.</B>The right to
    disqualify the presiding judge is based upon an assumed
    prejudice or bias on his part, and not upon his views regarding
    the law of the case. Walker v. People, 126 Colo. 135, 248 P.2d
    287 (1952); Altobella v. People, 161 Colo. 177, 420 P.2d 832
    (1966).</P>
    <P>
    <B>Thus, personal opinions as to issues generally not regarded
    as disqualifying judge.</B>Personal opinions of a trial judge
    concerning issues in the cause before the court, or even as to
    the guilt or innocence of a defendant in a criminal case, are
    generally not regarded as disqualifying the judge unless his
    opinions be so pronounced that it can reasonably be said that
    he will be biased and prejudiced thereby during the trial.
    Walker v. People, 126 Colo. 135, 248 P.2d 287 (1952).</P>
    <P>Speculation by trial judge concerning possible appellate
    response to a hypothetical review of the state's capital
    punishment statute does not provide the basis for an inference
    of any prejudice by the judge with respect to the defendant or
    his case. Rodriguez v. District Court, 719 P.2d 699 (Colo.
    1986).</P>
    <P>
    <B>Previous rulings of judge insufficient.</B>Previous rulings
    of a presiding judge, although erroneous, numerous, and
    continuous, especially when they are subject to review, are not
    sufficient to show such bias or prejudice as would disqualify
    him. Walker v. People, 126 Colo. 135, 248 P.2d 287 (1952);
    Altobella v. People, 161 Colo. 177, 420 P.2d 832 (1966).</P>
    <P>
    <B>Judges are not disqualified solely on the basis that they
    were formerly employed by the prosecutor's office.</B>Instead,
    when employed by that office, the judge to be disqualified must
    have performed some role in the case or have obtained actual
    knowledge of disputed evidentiary facts of the case. People v.
    Julien, 47 P.3d 1194 (Colo. 2002).</P>
    <P>
    <B>A judge is not required to sua sponte disqualify him- or
    herself when the judge is related to a juror.</B>Richardson v.
    People, 2020 CO 46, 481 P.3d 1, cert. denied, -- U.S. --, 141
    S. Ct. 1396, 209 L. Ed. 2d 133 (2021).</P>
    <P>
    <B>Nor does a judge have a duty to excuse a juror who is
    related to the judge</B>in the absence of any contemporaneous
    objection. Richardson v. People, 2020 CO 46, 481 P.3d 1, cert.
    denied, -- U.S. --, 141 S. Ct. 1396, 209 L. Ed. 2d 133
    (2021).</P>
    <P>
    <B>Judge not disqualified due to prior prosecution of defendant
    while employed by prosecutor's office.</B>Judge's prosecution
    of defendant seven years earlier involved similar but unrelated
    charges and resulted in a dismissal following defendant's
    successful motion to suppress. Judge not required to recuse
    himself where judge had no knowledge of evidentiary facts
    concerning the current case and no connection to the
    investigation, preparation, and presentation of the case.
    People v. Flockhart, 310 P.3d 66 (Colo. App. 2009), aff'd in
    part and rev'd in part, 2013 CO 42, 304 P.3d 227.</P>
    <P>
    <B>But trial judge, a former prosecutor, should have recused
    herself because she had served in a supervisory capacity over
    the attorneys who investigated or prosecuted</B>case at the
    time they filed the charges against defendant. People v.
    Mentzer, 2020 COA 91, 487 P.3d 1236.</P>
    <P>
    <B>Prejudice must be directed to defendant individually or as a
    member of group or organization.</B>The prejudice of a trial
    judge must be shown to be directed toward the defendant,
    individually, either as a result of personal dislike or feeling
    against the defendant, or that such prejudice may have resulted
    by reason of animosity toward some group or organization with
    which the defendant may have been associated or closely
    affiliated. Walker v. People, 126 Colo. 135, 248 P.2d 287
    (1952).</P>
    <P>
    <B>Bond orders did not establish bias.</B>The facts alleged
    concerning revocation of defendant's bond, resetting the bond
    at $100,000, and refusal to reduce the bond, when considered in
    the procedural setting out of which the orders arose, are not
    such as to establish to the satisfaction of a reasonable mind
    that the presiding judge had a bias or a prejudice that would
    in all probability prevent him from dealing fairly with the
    defendant. Altobella v. People, 161 Colo. 177, 420 P.2d 832
    (1966).</P>
    <P>
    <B>There can be no presumption that a judge is intimidated by
    the outrage of the community</B>in which the judge serves.
    Thus, motion for disqualification properly denied where there
    was no allegation that the judge was in fact intimidated by the
    community's animosity toward the defendant. People v. Vecchio,
    819 P.2d 533 (Colo. App. 1991).</P>
    <P>
    <B>The trial court's statement that defendant's motion for a
    competency hearing was a "ploy" to delay the trial</B>was
    adequately supported by what the judge learned in his judicial
    capacity during argument on pretrial motions concerning the
    defendant's competency, and such a statement does not
    constitute the kind of prejudice required for recusal. People
    v. Seigler, 832 P.2d 980 (Colo. App. 1991).</P>
    <P>
    <B>Judge's concern for welfare of alleged victim does not
    establish the reality or appearance of partiality.</B>Wilkerson
    v. District Ct., 925 P.2d 1373 (Colo. 1996).</P>
    <P>
    <B>Defendant did not establish actual bias requiring
    disqualification of sentencing judge.</B>While judge's
    statements that he would be "haunt[ed]" by his decision to
    grant probation during defendant's prior criminal sentencing
    showed the judge was affected by his prior decision to be
    lenient with defendant, they were not enough to establish that
    the judge was unable to sentence defendant fairly. People v.
    Dobler, 2015 COA 25, 369 P.3d 686.</P>
    <P>
    <B>Mere filing of complaint with the judicial performance
    commission,</B>without more, does not establish sufficient
    grounds for recusal. Further, county court judge's decision to
    recuse herself in seven prior cases does not lead to the
    conclusion that she should permanently recuse herself in all
    cases involving the attorneys. Kane v. County Court Jefferson
    County, 192 P.3d 443 (Colo. App. 2008).</P></ANNO-TEXT>

    <B>The credibility of the persons making the affidavits
    required by the statute will be presumed,</B>unless the
    contrary appears from the affidavits. People ex rel. Burke v.
    District Court, 60 Colo. 1, 152 P. 149 (1915). 
    <P>The facts set forth in affidavits supporting a motion to
    disqualify a judge are not subject to a trial court's inquiry,
    but are presumed to be true. Smith v. District Court, 629 P.2d
    1055 (Colo. 1981).</P>
    <P>
    <B>Facts establishing incompetency must be stated.</B>The mere
    assertion that the judge is prejudiced or incompetent is not
    sufficient. The facts from which prejudice or incompetency is
    to be inferred must be set forth. People ex rel. Burke v.
    District Court, 60 Colo. 1, 152 P. 149 (1915).</P>
    <P>In all cases necessary material or pertinent facts should be
    set out; in case of the prejudice of the judge, his attention
    would thus be called to some circumstance which he may have
    forgotten, or of which he was entirely ignorant, but which the
    petitioner might conceive to be a cause of prejudice. Hughes v.
    People, 5 Colo. 436 (1880).</P>
    <P>A motion and accompanying affidavits requesting
    disqualification of a trial judge from participating in a case
    properly assigned to that judge must state facts from which it
    may be reasonably inferred that the judge has a bias or
    prejudice with respect to the case, a party, or counsel.
    Rodriguez v. District Court, 719 P.2d 699 (Colo. 1986).</P>
    <P>The requirement in this section that prejudice of the judge
    must be shown is of the same effect as an earlier statute by
    which the facts were expressly required to be stated. Young v.
    People, 54 Colo. 293, 130 P. 1011 (1913).</P>
    <P>The mere statement of opinion or conclusion of the bias on
    the part of the trial judge is not sufficient in a motion
    seeking disqualification of a judge, and the facts from which
    the incompetency or prejudice is inferred must be stated. There
    has always been required, as essential to a proper recusation,
    a statement of facts in the affidavits sufficient to disclose
    the incompetency of the judge. Walker v. People, 126 Colo. 135,
    248 P.2d 287 (1952).</P>
    <P>Suspicion, surmise, speculation, rationalization,
    conjecture, innuendo, and statements of mere conclusions of the
    pleader may not be substituted for a statement of facts. Walker
    v. People, 126 Colo. 135, 248 P.2d 287 (1952); People v. Cook,
    22 P.3d 947 (Colo. App. 2000).</P>
    <P>
    <B>Affidavits need not state all essential facts.</B>The
    affidavits in support of a motion for disqualification do not
    have to contain every essential fact which establishes the
    judge's prejudice; it is sufficient if the affidavits verify
    the facts set forth in the motion. People v. Botham, 629 P.2d
    589 (Colo. 1981).</P>
    <P>
    <B>Affidavit may refer to another instrument for
    particulars.</B>An affidavit may be made full and complete by
    reference to an attached instrument, or by having the
    particular matters so referred to embodied in the affidavit
    itself. Either is sufficient. Ausmus v. People, 47 Colo. 167,

    <P>
    <B>Whether recusal is required</B>will depend on whether
    defendant's motion and supporting affidavits set forth legally
    sufficient facts upon which bias or prejudice may be implied.
    James v. People, 727 P.2d 850 (Colo. 1986); People v.

    <P>
    <B>Motions for disqualification of a judge must be filed at the
    very earliest opportunity.</B>Ordinarily this requires the
    filing of such a motion promptly upon the service of the
    information or at least by time of arraignment of the defendant
    in a criminal case. Usually the bias or animosity of the judge
    will be known to the defendant, or his counsel, at that time;
    hence the rule requiring prompt action. It is conceivable that
    in certain circumstances the fact of bias or prejudice on the
    part of a judge might not be ascertainable for some time after
    the filing of the information, but in such a situation a
    statement should be forthcoming showing the reason why the
    petition was not sooner filed. Walker v. People, 126 Colo. 135,

    or prejudice that will in all probability prevent him from
    dealing fairly with the defendant. Walker v. People, 126 Colo.

    People v. District Court, 192 Colo. 503, 560 P.2d 828
    (1977).</P>
    <P>The test of the legal sufficiency of a motion to disqualify
    a judge is whether the motion and affidavits state facts from
    which it may reasonably be inferred that the questioned judge
    has a bias or prejudice that will in all probability prevent
    him or her from dealing fairly with the defendant. Smith v.
    District Court, 629 P.2d 1055 (Colo. 1981); People v. Botham,

    <P>
    <B>Where defendant failed to submit affidavits in accordance

    <P>
    <B>Where nothing in motion or affidavits suggests that the
    judge or any employee was present when the defendant's crime
    pending before the judge was committed;</B>that the judge or
    any employee was in any way personally victimized by the crime;
    or that the work of the judge or any employee was disrupted by
    the crime, it cannot be said that judge would necessarily be
    prejudiced against the party charged as to be unable to be fair

    <B>What a judge learns in his judicial capacity is a proper

    adequately supported by what the judge learned in his judicial

    <B>Judge may determine sufficiency of motion but not question

    <P>The courts, in considering the sufficiency of the motion for

    <P>Although the trial judge must, of necessity, initially

    <P>
    <B>Thus, facts are accepted as true.</B>The change of judge is
    conditioned, not upon the actual fact of his prejudice, but
    upon the imputation of it. The facts set forth in the

    prejudice, the law-making power of our state has not deemed it
    proper to vest in such judge any discretion in the premises,
    and the judge whose competency is so questioned can only
    pronounce the judgment of the law. He cannot sit in judgment
    upon that which directly concerns himself. People ex rel. Burke
    v. District Court, 60 Colo. 1, 152 P. 149 (1915); People ex
    rel. Bennet v. District Court, 84 Colo. 367, 270 P. 663
    (1928).</P>
    <P>If the motion for disqualification be sufficient in form,
    and whether the allegations therein contained be in fact true
    or false, if they be set forth as facts they must be so
    accepted, and the judge may perform no further duty than that
    of entering an order of disqualification. He may not pass upon
    the facts. Walker v. People, 126 Colo. 135, 248 P.2d 287
    (1952).</P>
    <P>The trial judge has no discretion in the matter of recusing
    himself upon finding the affidavits sufficient under the rule
    to allege prejudice. He immediately loses all jurisdiction in
    the matter except to grant the change. People v. District
    Court, 192 Colo. 503, 560 P.2d 828 (1977).</P>
    <P>
    <B>Review of decision on motion.</B>Should the trial court
    conclude that the motion and affidavits in support of change of
    judge are insufficient to require the change, and a reviewing
    or superior tribunal find the contrary, the question upon which
    the two tribunals have differed is of law, not of fact.
    Therefore, the finding of the trial court in such case can have
    no bearing upon the issue when presented to a higher tribunal.
    People ex rel. Burke v. District Court, 60 Colo. 1, 152 P. 149
    (1915).</P>
    <P>
    <B>Motion held sufficient.</B>Motion for disqualification of
    respondent judge with request that a substitute judge be named
    was sufficient where petitioner had entered a plea of guilty
    before the respondent judge who then imposed sentence on the
    petitioner and on appeal petitioner's guilty plea was vacated
    but on remand the case was again assigned to the respondent
    judge. Golden v. District Court, 186 Colo. 300, 527 P.2d 60
    (1974).</P></ANNO-TEXT>

    <P>
    <B>Annotator's note.</B>Since § 16-7-101 is similar to repealed
    § 39-7-11, C.R.S. 1963, CSA, C. 48, § 484, and laws antecedent
    thereto, relevant cases construing those provisions have been
    included in the annotations to this section.</P>
    <P>
    <B>This section changes the common-law rule</B>that existed
    prior to its enactment, which left the granting of separate
    trials to defendants jointly indicted to the discretion of the
    court. Davis v. People, 22 Colo. 1, 43 P. 122 (1895).</P>
    <P>
    <B>Goal of section.</B>The goal underlying this section is to
    promote a fair determination of the issue of guilt or innocence
    of the defendant. People v. Gonzales, 198 Colo. 450, 601 P.2d
    1366 (1979); People v. Horne, 619 P.2d 53 (Colo. 1980).</P>
    <P>
    <B>The language of this section is positive and
    unequivocal.</B>Davis v. People, 22 Colo. 1, 43 P. 122
    (1895).</P>
    <P>
    <B>This section is mandatory when it appears that a defendant
    would be prejudiced</B>on a joint trial by the admission of
    evidence which would not be admissible as against him, but
    which would be competent as against his codefendant. Russell v.
    People, 125 Colo. 290, 242 P.2d 610 (1952).</P>
    <P>
    <B>A defendant is entitled to severance of trial as a matter of
    right if</B>there is evidence that is admissible against one
    but not all of the parties and if the evidence is prejudicial
    to the defendant against whom the evidence is not admissible.
    People v. Montoya, 942 P.2d 1287 (Colo. App. 1996).</P>
    <P>The supreme court has interpreted this section to mean, in
    the mandatory severance setting, that the trial court must
    determine whether the admitted evidence was so inherently
    prejudicial that the jury could not have limited its use to its
    proper purpose. People v. Montoya, 942 P.2d 1287 (Colo. App.
    1996).</P>
    <P>The trial court's decision will be affirmed absent a showing
    of an abuse of discretion and actual prejudice to the moving
    party. People v. Montoya, 942 P.2d 1287 (Colo. App. 1996).</P>
    <P>
    <B>Basis for severance.</B>Severance is to be based upon a
    finding of prejudice rather than simply the differences which
    are incidental to any trial of more than one defendant. People
    v. Johnson, 192 Colo. 483, 560 P.2d 465 (1977).</P>
    <P>
    <B>Severance is a matter of right under proper
    circumstances.</B>When a case as contemplated by this section
    is presented, it is the duty of the court to grant a severance
    as a matter of right. Davis v. People, 22 Colo. 1, 43 P. 122
    (1895).</P>
    <P>Where two are indicted jointly, and there is evidence not
    relating to reputation, admissible as against one of them, but
    inadmissible as against the other, the one against whom such
    evidence is inadmissible is entitled to a separate trial as of
    right under this section. Cook v. People, 56 Colo. 477, 138 P.
    756 (1914).</P>
    <P>
    <B>Where the evidence is admissible against all defendants,
    severance need not be allowed.</B>Moore v. People, 31 Colo.
    336, 73 P. 30 (1903); Cook v. People, 56 Colo. 477, 138 P. 756
    (1914).</P>
    <P>
    <B>Evidence of reputation of another defendant is expressly
    excluded as a ground for severance by this section.</B>Mukuri
    v. People, 92 Colo. 306, 19 P.2d 1040 (1933).</P>
    <P>A party under criminal indictment is not entitled to a
    severance on the ground that his codefendants were known in the
    community as men of bad reputation. Mukuri v. People, 92 Colo.
    306, 19 P.2d 1040 (1933).</P>
    <P>
    <B>Matter of severance left to discretion of trial
    court.</B>Where there was no claim that the joint trial
    involved evidence admissible against only one of the
    defendants, the matter of severance was left to the discretion
    of the trial court. People v. Johnson, 192 Colo. 483, 560 P.2d
    465 (1977).</P>
    <P>The granting or denial of a motion for severance and
    continuance is a matter within the sound discretion of the
    trial court. People v. Gable, 647 P.2d 246 (Colo. App.
    1982).</P>
    <P>A motion for severance of defendants is addressed to the
    sound discretion of the trial court. People v. Horne, 619 P.2d
    53 (Colo. 1980); People v. Vigil, 678 P.2d 554 (Colo. App.
    1983); People v. Adams, 678 P.2d 572 (Colo. App. 1984); People
    v. Durre, 713 P.2d 1344 (Colo. App. 1985); People v. Manners,
    713 P.2d 1348 (Colo. App. 1985).</P>
    <P>Although court properly denied motion for severance on
    evidentiary grounds, it was an abuse of discretion to deny
    motion for severance on speedy trial grounds under § 18-1-405
    where court made no finding of good cause why severance should
    not be granted. Finding of good cause is specifically required
    by § 18-1-405 (6)(c). People v. Hernandez, 829 P.2d 392 (Colo.
    App. 1991).</P>
    <P>
    <B>And denial not reversed unless defendant
    prejudiced.</B>Where there is no showing that the denial of a
    motion for severance prejudiced the defendant, the trial
    court's ruling will not be disturbed on appeal. People v.
    Horne, 619 P.2d 53 (Colo. 1980); People v. Magoon, 645 P.2d 286
    (Colo. App. 1982); People v. Vigil, 678 P.2d 554 (Colo. App.
    1983).</P>
    <P>
    <B>Severance not mandatory.</B>People v. Gallegos, 680 P.2d
    1294 (Colo. App. 1983).</P>
    <P>
    <B>Severance is not constitutionally mandated because of
    conflicting peremptory challenges exercised by defendant's
    counsel.</B>People v. Durre, 713 P.2d 1344 (Colo. App.
    1985).</P>
    <P>
    <B>To determine whether separate trials are required, a trial
    court must determine whether admitted evidence is so inherently
    prejudicial that the jury would not be able to limit its use to
    its proper purpose.</B>Otherwise, a motion for joinder is
    addressed to the discretion of the trial court, and will be
    affirmed absent a showing of an abuse of discretion and actual
    prejudice to the moving party. People v. Escano, 843 P.2d 111
    (Colo. App. 1992).</P>
    <P>
    <B>When an out-of-court statement of a co-defendant does not
    make reference to the co-defendant, severance should be granted
    only when it is necessary to promote a fair determination of
    the guilt or innocence of one or more defendants.</B>The court
    should make this determination by considering, among other
    factors, whether, in view of the number of offenses and
    defendants charged and the complexity of the evidence offered,
    the trier of fact will be able to distinguish the evidence and
    apply the law intelligently as to each offense and as to each
    defendant. People v. Escano, 843 P.2d 111 (Colo. App.
    1992).</P>
    <P>
    <B>Since a co-defendant's statements to the police, made in
    defendant's presence, are admissible against defendant,
    defendant is not entitled to severance as a matter of right
    under this section.</B>People v. Gardenhire, 903 P.2d 1159
    (Colo. App. 1995).</P>
    <P>
    <B>Trial court did not abuse its discretion by failing to sever
    defendant's case</B>where defendant's reason for requesting a
    severance was to be able to exercise additional peremptory
    challenges. People v. Lesney, 855 P.2d 1364 (Colo. 1993).</P>
    <P>
    <B>Two-part test for determining severance issues.</B>This
    section contemplates a two-part test for determining severance
    issues: (1) Whether there is material evidence admissible
    against one but not all of the parties; and (2) whether
    admission of that evidence would be prejudicial against whom
    the evidence is not admissible. People v. Gonzales, 198 Colo.
    450, 601 P.2d 1366 (1979); People v. Hernandez, 829 P.2d 392
    (Colo. App. 1991); People v. Escano, 843 P.2d 111 (Colo. App.
    1992).</P>
    <P>Test applied in People v. Barela, 689 P.2d 689 (Colo. App.
    1984); People v. Gregory, 691 P.2d 357 (Colo. App. 1984);
    People v. Peltz, 697 P.2d 766 (Colo. App. 1984), aff'd, 728
    P.2d 1271 (Colo. 1986); People v. Heller, 698 P.2d 1357 (Colo.
    App. 1984); People v. Pappadiakis, 705 P.2d 983 (Colo. App.
    1985), aff'd sub nom. Peltz v. People, 728 P.2d 1271 (Colo.
    1986).</P>
    <P>
    <B>Showing required to establish abuse of discretion.</B>To
    establish abuse of the trial court's discretion, more is
    required than a showing that separate trials might afford a
    better chance of acquittal. People v. Armstrong, 664 P.2d 716
    (Colo. App. 1982), rev'd on other grounds, 701 P.2d 17 (Colo.
    1985).</P>
    <P>Mutual participation of defendants in an offense is
    considered a logical basis for refusing to sever. People v.
    Adams, 678 P.2d 572 (Colo. App. 1984); People v. Carrillo, 946
    P.2d 544 (Colo. App. 1997), aff'd on other grounds, 974 P.2d
    478 (Colo. 1999).</P>
    <P>Factors to be considered in determining whether denial of
    severance constitutes an abuse of discretion include: (1)
    whether the number of defendants or the complexity of the
    evidence is such that the jury will probably confuse the law
    and evidence applicable to each defendant; (2) whether, despite
    admonitory instructions, evidence admissible against one
    defendant will improperly be considered against another; and
    (3) whether the defenses presented are antagonistic. People v.
    Escano, 843 P.2d 111 (Colo. App. 1992); People v. Carrillo, 946
    P.2d 544 (Colo. App. 1997), aff'd on other grounds, 974 P.2d
    478 (Colo. 1999).</P>
    <P>
    <B>Joint trial resulted in reversible prejudice
    when</B>defendant had to defend himself against both the
    prosecution and his codefendant; the joint trial prevented
    defendant from fully confronting the witnesses against him and
    thus from presenting a complete defense; defendant received one
    fewer peremptory challenge than his codefendant and was denied
    an additional challenge when confronted with a potential juror
    who expressed concern over retaliation; and the number of
    limiting instructions given in the case defeated any curative
    effect they may have had on the prejudice resulting from a
    joint trial. People v. Gutierrez, 2021 COA 110, 499 P.3d
    367.</P>
    <P>
    <B>Admission of testimony of codefendant not reversible
    error.</B>It was not reversible error to admit evidence
    concerning a description of defendants just because it was
    testimony of a codefendant as to whom the severance had been
    granted. In view of the inconclusive nature of the
    identification, it cannot be said that there was any prejudice
    to the defendants from the admission of this evidence, although
    it would clearly be a better procedure to conceal the source of
    the extrajudicial identifications. Kurtz v. People, 177 Colo.
    306, 494 P.2d 97 (1972).</P>
    <P>
    <B>This section is applicable to cases of conspiracy.</B>Davis
    v. People, 22 Colo. 1, 43 P. 122 (1895); Seebass v. People, 116
    Colo. 555, 182 P.2d 901 (1947).</P></ANNO-TEXT>
    <AN-DIV>II.
    <M>MOTION FOR SEVERANCE.</M></AN-DIV>
    <ANNO-TEXT>
    <B>Considerations in deciding motion for severance.</B>When
    deciding whether to grant a motion for severance, the trial
    court should consider whether evidence inadmissible against one
    defendant will be considered against the other defendant,
    despite the issuance by the trial court of the proper
    admonitory instructions. An additional consideration is whether
    the defendants plan to offer antagonistic defenses. People v.
    Gonzales, 198 Colo. 450, 601 P.2d 1366 (1979). 
    <P>Additional criteria for consideration in determining whether
    the possibility of prejudice and unfair trial will result if
    severance is denied is whether the number of defendants or the
    complexity of evidence, together with the applicable law, will
    be confused by the jury, as it applies the law to each
    defendant. People v. Warren, 196 Colo. 75, 582 P.2d 663
    (1978).</P>
    <P>Criteria applied in People v. Vigil, 678 P.2d 554 (Colo.
    App. 1983); People v. Backus, 952 P.2d 846 (Colo. App.
    1998).</P>
    <P>
    <B>Motion should set out the alleged incompetent
    evidence.</B>That a defendant will be prejudiced on a joint
    trial by the admission of evidence which is not admissible as
    against him but which is competent as against his codefendant
    must be made to appear in support of a motion for a severance,
    not by merely stating that evidence will be admitted which is
    not competent as against the moving defendant, but the evidence
    which it is claimed is incompetent must be set out so that the
    court will be given the opportunity to determine whether or not
    the defendant moving for a severance may be prejudiced. Such
    has been the recognized practice in this jurisdiction. Davis v.
    People, 22 Colo. 1, 43 P. 122 (1895); Moore v. People, 31 Colo.
    336, 73 P. 30 (1903); Robinson v. People, 76 Colo. 416, 232 P.
    672 (1925).</P>
    <P>Under the provisions of this section it is held that the
    showing in support of a motion for a severance was not
    sufficient to make the denial of the motion prejudicial error.
    The alleged incompetent evidence should be set out in the
    motion. Robinson v. People, 76 Colo. 416, 232 P. 672
    (1925).</P>
    <P>The trial court is to be guided by the contents of the
    motion and the affidavit and must be advised thereby as to the
    nature of the evidence before it can determine whether the
    severance should be granted. Where neither the motion, nor the
    required affidavit, shows sufficient cause, the trial court
    commits no error in denying the motion for severance. Russell
    v. People, 125 Colo. 290, 242 P.2d 610 (1952).</P>
    <P>
    <B>Unless it is impossible to set forth the evidence
    required.</B>While a motion for severance should set forth the
    evidence which it is claimed will prejudice the rights of the
    moving defendant, if it is impossible for him to set out such
    evidence, the motion will not be held insufficient because of
    his failure to do the impossible. Kolkman v. People, 89 Colo.
    8, 300 P. 575 (1931).</P>
    <P>
    <B>The application for severance must be supported by an
    affidavit</B>which definitely shows a good cause therefor.
    Robinson v. People, 76 Colo. 416, 232 P. 672 (1925).</P>
    <P>
    <B>Otherwise the motion is denied.</B>A motion for a separate
    trial which contained no statement of facts from which the
    court could determine whether there was evidence against a

    <P>When the essential presence of an accused in a court having

    requirement in the federal law that in pleading to an
    indictment he must actually speak for himself or remain mute in

    <B>But plea must be entered in open court.</B>A message from
    counsel for defendant to the prosecuting attorney, authorizing

    a plea. Whether by defendant or his counsel, the plea must be

    withdraw a plea duly made to an indictment or information, in
    order that he may file another plea or interpose objections to
    the proceedings which should have been presented before the
    plea; hence the action of a trial court in refusing a change of
    plea will not be reversed if there is no abuse of discretion.
    Abshier v. People, 87 Colo. 507, 289 P. 1081 (1930).</P>
    <P>Where a defendant in a criminal case is arraigned and enters
    pleas of not guilty and not guilty by reason of insanity, he
    does not thereafter have an absolute right to withdraw those
    pleas and enter a plea of guilty in order to avoid prosecution
    upon another information which includes habitual criminal
    counts. Matz v. People, 133 Colo. 45, 291 P.2d 1059 (1956).</P>
    <P>Defendants cannot withdraw consent which was freely given

    subconsciously unable to remember these details until a
    relatively recent date, the failure of the judge at the trial

    <B>This section and Crim. P. 11(b) require that a trial court

    Colo. 264, 539 P.2d 1238 (1975). 
    <P>
    <B>In pleading guilty, defendant must be adequately
    advised</B>of nature and critical elements of offense charged
    and reading of information may suffice. Wilson v. People, 708
    P.2d 792 (Colo. 1985).</P>
    <P>
    <B>If the trial judge doubted the credibility of the
    charge,</B>even though a factual basis for the guilty plea
    existed, his duty was to vacate the guilty plea, enter a plea

    <P>
    <B>No set ritual.</B>The overriding consideration in analyzing
    a record pertaining to a guilty plea or a plea of nolo

    Lambert, 189 Colo. 264, 539 P.2d 1238 (1975).</P>
    <P>Detailed discussion of possible locales of imprisonment not
    required. Wilson v. People, 708 P.2d 792 (Colo. 1985).</P>
    <P>
    <B>Or precise language in record.</B>If the record reflects
    that the trial court had assured itself that defendant's plea
    was voluntary and intelligently entered with full knowledge of
    the nature and elements of the offense and of the waiver of his
    rights as an accused person, then lack of precise language in
    the record expressing these things is not of itself a valid
    reason to reverse acceptance of a plea of nolo contendere.
    People v. Lambert, 189 Colo. 264, 539 P.2d 1238 (1975).</P>
    <P>
    <B>Record must reflect factual basis</B>for guilty plea and

    v. People, 708 P.2d 792 (Colo. 1985).</P>
    <P>
    <B>Full compliance would reduce challenges.</B>The failure of a
    trial judge to make certain that the record expressly reflects
    full compliance with this section and Crim. P. 11 before he
    accepts a plea of guilty or a plea of nolo contendere
    frequently generates a challenge. Full compliance would
    certainly diminish challenges and appeals. People v. Lambert,

    <P>
    <B>Duty to comply with Crim. P. 32(e).</B>The provision in
    Crim. P. 11(b)(5) and subsection (2)(e), that the court will
    not be bound by representations made to the defendant "unless
    the representations are included in a formal plea agreement
    approved by the court and supported by the findings of the
    presentence report ...", does not free the court from complying
    with Crim. P. 32(e), which requires that if the court decides
    that the final disposition should not include the charge or
    sentence concessions contemplated by a plea agreement, as
    provided in Crim. P. 11(f), it shall so advise the defendant
    and then call on the defendant to either affirm or withdraw his
    plea of guilty or nolo contendere. People v. Wright, 38 Colo.
    App. 271, 559 P.2d 249 (1976), aff'd, 194 Colo. 448, 573 P.2d
    551 (1978).</P>
    <P>Merely informing the defendant that the court will not be
    bound by any recommendation or representation by anyone
    concerning sentencing or probation does not obviate the
    necessity of its complying with Crim. P. 32(e). People v.
    Wright, 38 Colo. App. 271, 559 P.2d 249 (1976), aff'd, 194
    Colo. 448, 573 P.2d 551 (1978).</P>
    <P>
    <B>Authority to vacate guilty plea.</B>Although a trial judge's
    authority to dismiss a criminal charge on his own motion prior
    to trial, except as expressly authorized by statute or rule, is
    narrowly limited, a trial court does have the authority to
    vacate a guilty plea and enter a not guilty plea if the charges
    were not supported by facts appearing in the record of all
    court appearances and in the presentencing report. People v.
    Carino, 193 Colo. 412, 566 P.2d 1061 (1977).</P>
    <P>
    <B>A trial court is not generally required to inform a

    plea.</B>People v. Moore, 841 P.2d 320 (Colo. App. 1992);
    People v. Jones, 957 P.2d 1046 (Colo. App. 1997).</P>
    <P>To satisfy due process, a defendant must be informed only of
    the direct consequences of his guilty plea, which include those
    which have a definite, immediate, and largely automatic effect
    on the range of possible punishment. People v. Moore, 841 P.2d
    320 (Colo. App. 1992); People v. Jones, 957 P.2d 1046 (Colo.
    App. 1997).</P>
    <P>Accordingly, a guilty plea is not invalid for failure of a
    trial court to warn a defendant of its possible effect on
    future criminal liability. People v. Heinz, 589 P.2d 931 (Colo.

    <B>Annotator's note.</B>Since § 16-7-208 is similar to repealed
    § 39-7-9, C.R.S. 1963, § 39-7-9, CRS 53, and CSA, C. 48, § 483,
    relevant cases construing those provisions have been included

    <B>This section refers to an accused who refuses to

    <B>It has no application to a plea entered by counsel

    <P>
    <B>Court authorized to enter plea of not guilty only.</B>Where
    defendant, on being arraigned, stood mute, the court was
    without authority to enter a plea of "not guilty by reason of
    insanity at the time of the commission of the crime and since".
    The only plea that the court, under the circumstances, could
    properly enter for defendant was a plea of "not guilty". Boyd
    v. People, 108 Colo. 289, 116 P.2d 193 (1941).</P>
    <P>
    <B>Proceedings valid where defendant did not object to omission
    of plea.</B>Where defendant proceeded to trial without
    objection and contested the action as though a not guilty plea
    had been entered, and the fact that no such plea had been
    entered was not mentioned or called to the trial court's
    attention in the motion for a new trial, such omission did not
    render proceedings void and defendant is entitled to no relief
    by reason thereof. Landford v. People, 148 Colo. 300, 365 P.2d
    893 (1961), cert. denied, 369 U.S. 862, 82 S. Ct. 953, 8 L. Ed.
    2d 20 (1962).</P>
    <P>Where defendant proceeded to trial without objection and in
    all respects contested the case as though the "not guilty" plea
    had been entered, the defendant was not prejudiced by this
    procedural omission. The error or omission is called to the
    attention of the trial court by the appeal, and the entry of a
    plea of not guilty will suffice. Romero v. People, 170 Colo.

  <M>Where it appears that the effective administration of criminal
  justice will thereby be served, the district attorney may engage
  in plea discussions for the purpose of reaching a plea agreement.
  The district attorney should engage in plea discussions or reach
  plea agreements with the defendant only through or in the
  presence of defense counsel except where the defendant is not
  eligible for appointment of counsel because the defendant is not
  indigent or the charged offense does not include a possible
  sentence of incarceration or because the defendant refuses
  appointment of counsel and has not retained counsel.</M>

  following, depending upon the circumstances of the individual
  case:</M></P>
  <P N="(2)(a)">(a)
  <M>To make or not to oppose favorable recommendations concerning
  the sentence to be imposed if the defendant enters a plea of
  guilty or nolo contendere (no contest);</M></P>

    <B>This section does not have to be read in conjunction with
    the due process clause</B>of the United States constitution so
    as to guarantee that each confederate in crime would be given a

    <B>Subsection (2) relates to authority granted to district
    attorney in plea agreements, not to defendants who are able to

    authorization.</B>This includes a waiver of due process rights.
    People v. Gurule, 748 P.2d 1329 (Colo. App. 1987).</P>
    <P>
    <B>Generally, a guilty plea must be voluntarily, knowingly and
    intelligently made in order to be valid.</B>To be voluntary, a
    guilty plea cannot be induced by misrepresentation, including
    unfulfilled or unfulfillable promises. Chae v. People, 780 P.2d
    481 (Colo. 1989).</P>
    <P>
    <B>A plea induced by a promised sentence that is statutorily
    unavailable is invalid.</B>Chae v. People, 780 P.2d 481 (Colo.
    1989).</P>
    <P>
    <B>When a defendant enters into a plea agreement that includes
    as a material element a recommendation for an illegal
    sentence</B>and the illegal sentence is in fact imposed on the
    defendant, the guilty plea is invalid and must be vacated
    because the basis on which the defendant entered the plea
    included the impermissible inducement of an illegal sentence.
    Chae v. People, 780 P.2d 481 (Colo. 1989).</P>
    <P>
    <B>Where the sentence recommendation provided for an illegal
    suspended sentence,</B>the basis for the guilty plea amounted
    to an invalid, unfulfillable promise. Therefore, the guilty
    plea must be vacated because the illegal sentence
    recommendation in the plea agreement invalidated the guilty
    plea. Chae v. People, 780 P.2d 481 (Colo. 1989).</P>
    <P>Withdrawal of guilty plea proper where plea results in
    illegal suspension of mandatory sentence. People v. Hummel, 131
    P.3d 1204 (Colo. App. 2006).</P>
    <P>
    <B>However, where there is a valid plea agreement but an
    illegal sentence imposed to enforce the valid and legal plea,
    the proper remedy is to modify the sentence to effect the
    intent of the plea agreement.</B>People v. Antonio-Antimo, 29
    P.3d 298 (Colo. 2000).</P>
    <P>
    <B>The trial court was correct in reinstating defendant's plea
    of guilty because the plea bargain at issue itself was legal,
    only one provision of the sentence was illegal, and because
    that illegality had been rectified.</B>People v. Fennell, 32
    P.3d 1092 (Colo. App. 2000).</P>
    <P>
    <B>Since an illegal sentencing provision prevented the
    defendant from being bound by his original plea
    agreement,</B>the district attorney also is not bound by the
    agreement. Chae v. People, 780 P.2d 481 (Colo. 1989).</P>
    <P>
    <B>Defendant received no promise constituting an inappropriate
    inducement to plead guilty</B>from either the prosecutor or
    trial court in that nothing in the plea agreement could be
    interpreted to eliminate or alter the application of the
    mandatory parole provisions of § 18-1-105. Benavidez v. People,
    986 P.2d 943 (Colo. 1999).</P>
    <P>
    <B>Defendant was sufficiently well advised of the mandatory
    parole requirement</B>so as to enter a plea with sufficient
    knowledge of the consequences. Benavidez v. People, 986 P.2d
    943 (Colo. 1999); People v. Jones, 997 P.2d 1286 (Colo. App.
    1999).</P>
    <P>
    <B>The record as a whole, including the advisement given at the
    time a defendant pleaded guilty to the charge, must be
    considered in determining whether the defendant was adequately
    advised concerning mandatory parole at the time he pleaded
    guilty to a complaint alleging a probation violation.</B>People
    v. Wright, 53 P.3d 730 (Colo. App. 2002).</P>
    <P>
    <B>Identical concessions not required for similarly situated
    defendants.</B>This section and Crim. P. 11(f)(3) do not
    require that similarly situated defendants be offered identical
    concessions. People v. Lewis, 671 P.2d 985 (Colo. App.
    1983).</P>
    <P>
    <B>This section relates to plea agreements, rather than to
    sentencing procedures.</B>People v. Bruebaker, 189 Colo. 219,
    539 P.2d 1277 (1975).</P>
    <P>
    <B>Agreements to dismiss pending prosecutions,</B>distinguished
    from plea bargains by the absence of any element of admission
    of guilt, often have been deemed contrary to public policy and
    unenforceable. People v. Marquez, 644 P.2d 59 (Colo. App.
    1981).</P>
    <P>
    <B>If a plea of guilty results from plea bargaining and the
    bargain is not honored,</B>the judgment must be vacated. People
    v. McClellan, 183 Colo. 176, 515 P.2d 1127 (1973).</P>
    <P>
    <B>Defendant not entitled to reduction in
    sentence.</B>Defendant entered into a plea agreement for a
    reduced sentence if a district attorney's polygraphist
    determined that the defendant was telling the truth. Defendant
    then refused to disclose the results of earlier polygraph tests
    administered by a defense polygraphist. DA's polygraphist
    testified that it was necessary for him to review the results
    of those tests before offering an opinion as to the
    truthfulness of the defendant's story. The court could not
    order the defendant to turnover the results of the earlier
    polygraph tests, but, if he did not do so, the court was not
    obligated to reduce the sentence. People v. Johnson, 999 P.2d

    <B>When rejecting a plea agreement,</B>a trial court must

    <P>
    <B>Court has discretion to reject a plea agreement, separately
    from the merits, on the basis that the parties tendered it in
    an untimely fashion.</B>The trial court must provide adequate
    notice to the parties of the plea bargain cutoff date and must
    permit an exception to the rule for good cause. If a court
    rejects a plea for failure to conform to plea deadline, court
    need not necessarily consider the terms of the plea agreement
    proffered by the parties. People v. Jasper, 17 P.3d 802 (Colo.

    <B>Court must indicate position in plea-bargaining

    <P>
    <B>When the trial judge couples his intervention into plea
    negotiations with threats</B>of a longer sentence if the
    defendant goes to trial and is found guilty, he has attempted
    to use his office to force the defendant to waive his right to
    a jury trial or be penalized for exercising this
    constitutionally guaranteed right. People v. Clark, 183 Colo.
    201, 515 P.2d 1242 (1973).</P>
    <P>
    <B>Defendant's motion to withdraw guilty plea must be granted
    where trial judge participated in plea negotiations.</B>Because
    trial judge stepped out of his role as a neutral and impartial
    arbiter of justice by advising defendant and making other
    inappropriate remarks to influence defendant to agree to plea
    bargain, defendant has a fair and just reason to withdraw his
    plea. Crumb v. People, 230 P.3d 726 (Colo. 2010).</P>

    <B>Where no basis for disqualification of judge.</B>In the
    context of a confidential plea-bargaining conference, conducted
    off-the-record and in chambers, and where the challenged
    statement by the court implies nothing more than the judge's
    belief that the proposed plea and sentence concessions would
    not do justice, there is no basis for disqualification. Sober

    <P>
    <B>In the context of plea agreements, "sentence stipulations",
    "sentence agreements", "sentence concessions", and other
    similar terms are nothing more than sentence recommendations
    that the trial court is free to accept or reject, including
    after the defendant's guilty plea.</B>This section requires the
    trial court to exercise its independent judgment in deciding
    whether to accept or reject sentence concessions in a plea
    agreement, and allow the defendant, but not the people, to
    withdraw from a plea agreement when the trial court rejects a
    sentence concession after the defendant has pleaded guilty.

    aff'd, 194 Colo. 448, 573 P.2d 551 (1978).</P>
    <P>
    <B>When a defendant enters a plea agreement</B>that includes a
    recommendation for a particular sentence, the fact that the
    sentence is rejected by the court removes the basis upon which
    the defendant entered his guilty plea and draws into question
    the voluntariness of the plea. Chae v. People, 780 P.2d 481
    (Colo. 1989).</P>
    <P>
    <B>A court is not bound to accept a prosecutor's sentence
    recommendations,</B>and in fact, is statutorily mandated to

    <B>Trial court did not have to follow the plea

    <P>
    <B>Decision of judge should be independently reached.</B>When a

    existence, he should reach an independent decision on whether

    <B>Hearing necessary prerequisite to admit statements made in
    conjunction with withdrawn plea.</B>A defendant who challenges
    the voluntariness or reliability of statements made in the
    course of tendering a guilty plea which is subsequently
    withdrawn or rejected and is later sought to be used against
    him at trial for impeachment purposes is entitled to a hearing
    which provides the safeguards set forth in Jackson v. Denno,
    (378 U.S. 368, 84 S. Ct. 1774, 12 L. Ed. 2d 908 (1964)) before
    those statements may be used against him. People v. Cole, 195
    Colo. 483, 584 P.2d 71 (1978). 
    <P>
    <B>Where defendant's statements inadmissible.</B>Where the
    defendant's statements were made in the course of plea
    negotiations, for the narrowly limited purpose of assisting the
    district attorney and the court in determining whether he was
    an appropriate candidate for deferred sentencing, and where,
    when the statements were elicited, it was contemplated by both
    sides that they would have no probative effect on the issue of
    guilt or innocence, for both parties then assumed that a guilty
    plea would be entered, when the defendant did withdraw from the
    plea negotiations, thus aborting the only purpose for which his
    inculpatory statements had been given, it was palpably unfair
    to allow the prosecution to use those statements against him
    for an entirely unintended purpose to prove his guilt. Gelfand
    v. People, 196 Colo. 487, 586 P.2d 1331 (1978).</P>
    <P>
    <B>Where a trial court has accepted a defendant's plea
    agreement in which the prosecution and defendant have
    stipulated to imposition of concurrent sentences,</B>the court
    is obligated under the plea agreement either to impose only
    concurrent periods of incarceration or to grant only concurrent
    periods of probation. People v. Flenniken, 720 P.2d 617 (Colo.

    <B>Annotator's note.</B>Since § 16-8-101 is similar to repealed

    <B>Test of criminal responsibility is policy of general

    the category of recognized criminal irresponsibility are
    questions of policy which are properly within the province of

    <P>The test of insanity prescribed by this section is not so
    uncertain, ambiguous, and unintelligible as to constitute a
    deprivation of due process of law. Castro v. People, 140 Colo.
    493, 346 P.2d 1020 (1959).</P>
    <P>
    <B>This section has adopted the M'Naghten right and wrong test
    and the irresistible impulse test.</B>Thus a person is held to
    be insane as far as the criminal laws are concerned when he is
    so diseased in mind as to be incapable of distinguishing right
    from wrong or where he suffers such an impairment of mind as to
    render him incapable of choosing the right and refraining from
    doing the wrong. Castro v. People, 140 Colo. 493, 346 P.2d 1020
    (1959).</P>
    <P>
    <B>Rationale for excusing from criminal responsibility.</B>A
    person who is criminally insane is excused from criminal
    responsibility for his actions because, due to a mental disease
    or defect, he lacks the capacity to distinguish right from
    wrong with respect to the act or to adhere to the right or
    refrain from the wrong. Hendershott v. People, 653 P.2d 385
    (Colo. 1982), cert. denied, 459 U.S. 1225, 103 S. Ct. 1232, 75
    L. Ed. 2d 466 (1983).</P>
    <P>
    <B>Section does not address defendant's ability to form
    particular mental state.</B>This section's definition addresses
    the issue of whether the defendant has sufficient mental
    capacity to be held accountable for any crimes he may have
    committed. It does not answer the question of whether the
    defendant was capable of forming a particular mental state
    required for a conviction of the substantive charge. People v.
    Morgan, 637 P.2d 338 (Colo. 1981).</P>
    <P>
    <B>An insane defendant can be found guilty of a
    crime,</B>provided he was not insane at the time of the
    offenses charged. People v. Gillings, 39 Colo. App. 387, 568
    P.2d 92 (1977).</P>
    <P>
    <B>Trial court did not err</B>in precluding expert witness from
    offering an opinion as to whether defendant was legally insane
    in 1981 where the single issue to be determined by the jury was
    defendant's legal sanity or insanity at the time of the killing
    in 1983. People v. Galimanis, 944 P.2d 626 (Colo. App.
    1997).</P>
    <P>
    <B>Trial court did not improperly exclude evidence of specific
    instances of defendant's conduct that occurred during
    defendant's confinement at state hospital in the months
    subsequent to the killing</B>for which the defendant was on
    trial. People v. Galimanis, 944 P.2d 626 (Colo. App. 1997).</P>
    <P>
    <B>Different standard for competence to stand trial.</B>A
    criminal defendant who raises the sanity issue is
    constitutionally entitled to a separate hearing to determine
    his competence to stand trial because a different standard
    determines competence to stand trial from that which determines
    the validity of a defense of not guilty by reason of insanity.
    Parks v. Denver District Court, 180 Colo. 202, 503 P.2d 1029
    (1972).</P>
    <P>
    <B>Insanity tests under this section and § 16-8-120
    different.</B>The general assembly has chosen by enactment of
    this section and § 16-8-120 to distinguish between the test in
    a criminal case for a verdict of not guilty by reason of
    insanity and the test for release from a mental institution
    once it is suggested that commitment might safely be
    terminated. People v. Lyles, 186 Colo. 302, 526 P.2d 1332
    (1974).</P>
    <P>
    <B>And defendant was not denied due process</B>by failure to
    apply as the standard for release the same test applied to
    determine whether he was insane several years earlier when the
    alleged crime was committed. People v. Giles, 192 Colo. 240,
    557 P.2d 408 (1976).</P>
    <P>
    <B>Where defendant was insane at the time of his escape, he
    should not be held accountable for his escape</B>so as to
    forfeit good time earned prior thereto, or be held subject to
    the sanctions of § 17-1-207 (2) (as that section existed prior
    to the repeal and reenactment of title 17 in 1977), by which he
    was ordered by the administrative adjustment committee to serve
    at least two calendar years from and after his administrative
    transfer to the prison, without the opportunity to earn good
    time during this two-year period. It would be an anomaly that
    the defendant, by reason of his legal insanity and
    unaccountability, could not have been convicted of a felonious
    escape under § 18-8-208, whereas he could be held accountable
    for his escape and be subject to the statutory sanctions
    resulting therefrom, in spite of his insanity and
    unaccountability. Lange v. Schauer, 184 Colo. 373, 520 P.2d 753
    (1974).</P>
    <P>
    <B>A court cannot find one sane who had previously been found
    insane unless</B>he is first "released from commitment"
    pursuant to law. People v. Gillings, 39 Colo. App. 387, 568
    P.2d 92 (1977).</P>
    <P>A person found insane as to one time cannot be held to be
    sane at a subsequent time unless and until there is compliance
    with the statutory mandates relating to release from
    commitment. People v. Gillings, 39 Colo. App. 387, 568 P.2d 92
    (1977).</P>
    <P>
    <B>Insanity adjudication results in a presumptive continuation
    of a state of mental incapacity</B>until it is shown that
    sanity has been restored. People v. Giles, 662 P.2d 1073 (Colo.
    1983).</P>
    <P>
    <B>But committed person not incapable of committing
    crimes.</B>An insanity adjudication represents a judicial
    determination that an accused is not legally responsible for a
    past criminal act by reason of a mental disease or defect which
    existed at the time the act was committed. It is simply not
    true, however, that an insanity adjudication renders a
    committed person legally incapable of committing future crimes
    during the period of commitment. People v. Giles, 662 P.2d 1073
    (Colo. 1983).</P>
    <P>
    <B>While a finding of insanity as to one time is binding on the
    courts,</B>such a finding does not mandate a finding of
    insanity as to an earlier time period. People v. Gillings, 39
    Colo. App. 387, 568 P.2d 92 (1977).</P>
    <P>
    <B>Finding of sanity as to one act does not preclude different
    finding as to another act.</B>Where acts are separated by time
    and location, a finding of sanity as to one act would not
    preclude a different finding as to the later ones. People v.
    Beasley, 43 Colo. App. 488, 608 P.2d 835 (1979).</P>
    <P>
    <B>The distinction between insanity and incompetency must be
    sharply drawn.</B>Incompetency merely abates the action and is
    procedural in effect, while insanity is substantive and renders
    the defendant not guilty. People v. Gillings, 39 Colo. App.
    387, 568 P.2d 92 (1977).</P>
    <P>Insane persons are, under the law, not necessarily
    incompetent to stand trial because of the fact of their
    insanity, while, in contrast, an incompetent defendant may not
    be tried. People v. Gillings, 39 Colo. App. 387, 568 P.2d 92
    (1977).</P>
    <P>Although a person may be both insane and incompetent,
    likewise, one may be insane and yet competent to stand trial.
    People v. Gillings, 39 Colo. App. 387, 568 P.2d 92 (1977).</P>
    <P>
    <B>A person adjudicated not guilty by reason of insanity as
    defined in this section and § 16-8-101.5 is not a handicapped
    individual</B>under § 504 of the Rehabilitation Act of 1973.
    Neiberger v. Hawkins, 239 F. Supp. 2d 1140 (D. Colo. 2002).</P>
    <P>
    <B>The "deific-decree" delusion is recognized in Colorado;</B>a
    defendant may be judged legally insane if the defendant's
    cognitive ability to distinguish right from wrong with respect
    to the act has been destroyed as a result of a psychotic
    delusion that God has decreed the act. People v. Serravo, 823
    P.2d 128 (Colo. 1992).</P>
    <P>
    <B>But the trial court did not err in refusing to submit an
    instruction specifying that a "deific-decree" delusion could
    constitute legal insanity</B>where the court instead submitted
    an instruction explaining that the term "incapable of
    distinguishing right from wrong" refers to cognitive inability,
    due to mental disease or defect, to distinguish right from
    wrong as measured by a societal standard of morality, even
    though the person may be aware that the conduct in question is
    criminal. People v. Tally, 7 P.3d 172 (Colo. App. 1999).</P>
    <P>
    <B>Trial court did not err in refusing to include as a jury
    instruction that a "deific-decree" delusion could constitute
    legal insanity</B>where there was no evidence that defendant
    felt he was under any compulsion by God to murder the victim.
    People v. Galimanis, 944 P.2d 626 (Colo. App. 1997).</P>
    <P>
    <B>The concepts of "right" and "wrong" are essentially ethical
    in character</B>and have their primary source in the existing
    societal standards of morality as distinguished from the
    written law. But a personal and subjective standard of morality
    should not be permitted to exonerate a defendant. People v.
    Serravo, 823 P.2d 128 (Colo. 1992).</P>
    <P>
    <B>Trial court was not required to submit the clarifying
    instruction on the definition of legal insanity specifying that
    right from wrong is measured by a societal standard</B>where
    defendant did not contend that his actions were justified under
    his own moral beliefs or moral code, nor that he was conscious
    that what he was doing was right or wrong, either legally or
    morally. People v. Galimanis, 944 P.2d 626 (Colo. App.
    1997).</P>
    <P>
    <B>The appropriate construction of the term "incapable of
    distinguishing right from wrong"</B>should be measured by
    existing societal standards of morality rather than a
    defendant's personal and subjective understanding of the
    legality or illegality of the act in question. People v.
    Serravo, 823 P.2d 128 (Colo. 1992).</P>
    <P>
    <B>Res judicata or collateral estoppel do not operate to make a
    prior adjudication of insanity into a conclusive presumption of
    insanity or incompetence to stand trial</B>for criminal acts
    which are committed after an insanity adjudication but before a
    formal restoration of the defendant to sanity. Blehm v. People,
    817 P.2d 988 (Colo. 1991).</P>
    <P>
    <B>When a mental infirmity is directly caused by voluntary
    intoxication, even though effects have dissipated, the
    defendant is not diseased within legal insanity
    statute,</B>and, therefore, court was correct in refusing to
    issue jury instruction on settled insanity doctrine. People v.
    Bieber, 835 P.2d 542 (Colo. App. 1992), aff'd, 856 P.2d 811
    (Colo. 1993), cert. denied, 510 U.S. 1054, 114 S. Ct. 716, 126
    L. Ed. 2d 680 (1994).</P>
    <P>
    <B>Instruction in language of section is proper.</B>No error is
    committed when a trial court submits to the jury an instruction
    which is drafted substantially in the language of this section,
    and which has been approved by the Colorado supreme court. The
    words "depravity" and "obliquity", while not used in every day
    conversation, are well within the comprehension of a jury.
    Simms v. People, 174 Colo. 85, 482 P.2d 974 (1971).</P>
    <P>Jury instruction which set forth the test of insanity in the
    exact language of the statute was held to be proper. Salas v.
    People, 181 Colo. 321, 509 P.2d 586 (1973).</P>
    <P>
    <B>Trial court is not required to provide an instruction on the
    phrase "moral obliquity",</B>as such term is well within the
    comprehension of a jury. People v. Galimanis, 944 P.2d 626

    <B>A person adjudicated not guilty by reason of insanity as

    individual</B>under § 504 of the Rehabilitation Act of 1973.
    Neiberger v. Hawkins, 239 F. Supp. 2d 1140 (D. Colo. 2002). 
    <P>
    <B>Exclusion for voluntary ingestion of intoxicating
    substances</B>applies to both prongs of the insanity test.
    People v. Grant, 174 P.3d 798 (Colo. App. 2007).</P>
    <P>
    <B>Defendant offered insufficient evidence showing that he was
    insane or incompetent to stand trial.</B>Since defendant failed
    to introduce sufficient evidence on those issues, the court
    need not determine whether defendant could offer evidence of
    "settled insanity" along with other evidence of his mental
    condition on the issue of sanity. People v. Grenier, 200 P.3d
    1062 (Colo. App. 2008).</P>
    <P>
    <B>Trial court properly instructed the jury that "any mental
    illness suffered by defendant is not a defense in this
    case".</B>Defendant's mental illness does not support the
    defense of involuntary intoxication since the defense of
    involuntary intoxication involves a temporary condition, and
    bipolar is not a temporary condition. Defendant's bipolar
    condition would have provided evidence for an insanity defense,
    but defendant did not plead insanity, which requires a special
    pleading. Therefore, the court properly instructed the jury
    that mental illness was not a defense in this case. People v.
    Sommers, 200 P.3d 1089 (Colo. App. 2008).</P>
    <P>
    <B>Trial court did not err by finding defendant sane at the
    time of his offense.</B>Prosecution presented sufficient
    evidence from two psychologist expert witnesses that
    defendant's behavior was not driven by insanity but by drugs
    and antisocial behavior. People v. Porter, 2013 COA 130, 353

    <P>
    <B>Evidence of defendant's sanity as to one of eleven counts

    <P>
    <B>The primary purpose of</B>the competency hearing is to
    ascertain whether he has sufficient mental capacity to know the
    nature of the charge and to cooperate with his counsel in his
    defense. Parks v. Denver District Court, 180 Colo. 202, 503
    P.2d 1029 (1972).</P>
    <P>
    <B>It is a separate hearing tried by different standard.</B>A
    criminal defendant who raises the sanity issue is
    constitutionally entitled to a separate hearing to determine
    his competence to stand trial because a different standard
    determines competence to stand trial from that which determines
    the validity of a defense of not guilty by reason of insanity.
    Parks v. Denver District Court, 180 Colo. 202, 503 P.2d 1029
    (1972).</P>
    <P>
    <B>Where the expert witness testified that the defendant had
    done "quite well" on a competency assessment</B>that addressed
    whether the defendant had a realistic appreciation of the
    charges against him and the consequences of those charges and
    whether the defendant could work effectively with his counsel,
    the trial court's finding of competency was adequately
    supported and could not be set aside. People v. Tally, 7 P.3d
    172 (Colo. App. 1999).</P>
    <P>
    <B>"Culpable mental state" as used in the definition of
    "impaired mental condition" speaks to mental condition not
    state of mind.</B>People v. Fincham, 799 P.2d 419 (Colo. App.
    1990).</P>
    <P>
    <B>No finding of dangerousness is necessary to hold defendant
    ineligible to remain on conditional release if defendant has
    violated one or more conditions of release.</B>Conditions of
    release are presumably imposed to eliminate or reduce the risk
    of future dangerous conduct by the defendant. People v. McCoy,
    821 P.2d 873 (Colo. App. 1991).</P>
    <P>The condition violated must bear a substantial relationship
    to the prevention of recurring mental illness or the management
    of an insanity acquittee's existing mental illness, and to the
    prevention of future dangerous behavior arising from the mental
    illness. If defendant has violated such a condition, the court
    may revoke the conditional release without infringing upon due
    process. People v. Garlotte, 958 P.2d 469 (Colo. App.
    1997).</P>
    <P>
    <B>The distinction between insanity and incompetency must be
    sharply drawn.</B>Incompetency merely abates the action and is
    procedural in effect, while insanity is substantive and renders
    the defendant not guilty. People v. Gillings, 39 Colo. App.
    387, 568 P.2d 92 (1977).</P>
    <P>Insane persons are, under the law, not necessarily
    incompetent to stand trial because of the fact of their
    insanity, while, in contrast, an incompetent defendant may not
    be tried. People v. Gillings, 39 Colo. App. 387, 568 P.2d 92
    (1977).</P>
    <P>Although a person may be both insane and incompetent,
    likewise, one may be insane and yet competent to stand trial.
    People v. Gillings, 39 Colo. App. 387, 568 P.2d 92 (1977).</P>
    <P>
    <B>Involuntary intoxication and insanity are legally separate
    and distinct defenses with significantly distinct
    consequences.</B>People v. Garcia, 113 P.3d 775 (Colo.
    2005).</P>
    <P>
    <B>Defendant's failure to plead the affirmative defense of
    impaired mental condition did not bar expert testimony that
    defendant focused on only one thing at a time.</B>The defendant
    did not suffer from mental disease or defect. The condition was
    not "severely abnormal". And the condition did not grossly and
    demonstrably impair the defendant's perception of reality,
    where defendant did not claim he was unable to recognize or
    understand the reality of the situation he was in, but instead,
    as he did not process information quickly, did not notice it.

  <M>Pleading insanity as a defense.</M></CATCH-LINE>(1)
  <N></N>(a)
  <M>The defense of insanity may only be raised by a specific plea
  entered at the time of arraignment; except that the court, for
  good cause shown, may permit the plea to be entered at any time
  prior to trial. The form of the plea shall be: "Not guilty by
  reason of insanity"; and it must be pleaded orally either by the
  defendant or by the defendant's counsel. A defendant who does not
  raise the defense as provided in this section shall not be
  permitted to rely upon insanity as a defense to the crime charged
  but, when charged with a crime requiring a specific intent as an
  element thereof, may introduce evidence of the defendant's mental
  condition as bearing upon his or her capacity to form the
  required specific intent. The plea of not guilty by reason of
  insanity includes the plea of not guilty.</M>
  <P N="(1)(b)">(b)

  <M>The defense of insanity may only be raised by a specific plea

  <P N="(2)">(2)
  <M>If counsel for the defendant believes that a plea of not
  guilty by reason of insanity should be entered on behalf of the
  defendant but the defendant refuses to permit the entry of the
  plea, counsel may so inform the court. The court shall then
  conduct such investigation as it deems proper, which may include
  the appointment of psychiatrists or forensic psychologists to
  assist in examining the defendant and advising the court. After
  its investigation the court shall conduct a hearing to determine
  whether the plea should be entered. If the court finds that the
  entry of a plea of not guilty by reason of insanity is necessary
  for a just determination of the charge against the defendant, it
  shall enter the plea on behalf of the defendant, and the plea so
  entered shall have the same effect as though it had been
  voluntarily entered by the defendant himself or herself.</M></P>
  <P N="(3)">(3)
  <M>If there has been no grand jury indictment or preliminary
  hearing prior to the entry of the plea of not guilty by reason of
  insanity, the court shall hold a preliminary hearing prior to the
  trial of the insanity issue. If probable cause is not
  established, the case shall be dismissed, but the court may order
  the district attorney to institute civil proceedings pursuant to
  article 65 of title 27, C.R.S., if it appears that the protection
  of the public or the accused requires it.</M></P>
  <P N="(4)">(4)

    <P>
    <B>Annotator's note.</B>Since § 16-8-103 is similar to repealed
    § 39-8-1, C.R.S. 1963, § 39-8-1, CRS 53, CSA, C. 48, § 507, and
    laws antecedent thereto, relevant cases construing those
    provisions have been included in the annotations to this
    section.</P>
    <P>
    <B>The affirmative defense of impaired mental condition is
    separate and distinct from the defense of insanity;</B>its sole
    effect is to negate the existence of an element of the crime
    charged. However, if a defendant intends to raise the defense
    of impaired mental condition at trial, he must also specially
    plead the defense at arraignment. People v. Bolton, 859 P.2d
    311 (Colo. App. 1993).</P>
    <P>
    <B>The purpose of this section</B>is to require the defense of
    insanity to be tried only under a special plea, to require this
    plea to be interposed at the time of arraignment, and to
    require a special verdict on this issue. This defense cannot
    now be introduced under the plea of "not guilty", as it
    formerly could be. Ingles v. People, 92 Colo. 518, 22 P.2d 1109
    (1933); Mundy v. People, 105 Colo. 547, 100 P.2d 584
    (1940).</P>
    <P>
    <B>Notwithstanding this section, based upon a criminal
    defendant's constitutional right to due process, the
    defendant's "mental slowness" may be considered as factual
    evidence</B>to support the argument that he or she lacked the
    required culpable mental state. People v. Vanrees, 125 P.3d 403
    (Colo. 2005).</P>
    <P>
    <B>Constitutionality.</B>The constitutional provision
    concerning the inviolability of jury trials does not prohibit
    the general assembly from changing the method of raising the
    question of insanity. Nor does the requirement that in order to
    raise the question of insanity, the defendant must plead it in
    the specified manner, offend against the due process clause of
    the constitution. Ingles v. People, 92 Colo. 518, 22 P.2d 1109
    (1933).</P>
    <P>A statute which requires a special plea to be entered in
    cases where insanity is relied on as a defense does not deny
    due process of law. Leick v. People, 131 Colo. 353, 281 P.2d
    806 (1955).</P>
    <P>The requirement that a special plea as to insanity be
    entered to be followed by a period of observation does not deny
    to a defendant any constitutional right. Robbins v. People, 142
    Colo. 254, 350 P.2d 818 (1960).</P>
    <P>
    <B>Subsection (2) not unconstitutional.</B>Subsection (2),
    which provides for the determination of the issue of
    defendant's sanity in advance of trial, is not facially
    unconstitutional. Les v. Meredith, 193 Colo. 3, 561 P.2d 1256
    (1977).</P>
    <P>Subsection (2) does not offend traditional notions of fair
    play and substantial justice. Public safety and welfare
    considerations override the reasons assigned by the trial court
    for its declaration of unconstitutionality, i.e., that in
    violation of §§ 16 and 25 of art. II, Colo. Const., defendant
    had lost his right to confront witnesses against him, the right
    to appear and defend against the charges made, the right to
    assert all available defenses, and the right to a public trial
    upon the merits of the charges. Les v. Meredith, 193 Colo. 3,
    561 P.2d 1256 (1977).</P>
    <P>The administration of justice is improved if, upon having
    reason to do so and after holding a hearing, a trial judge can
    enter a plea of not guilty by reason of insanity on behalf of
    the defendant, irrespective of the defendant's wishes. Les v.
    Meredith, 193 Colo. 3, 561 P.2d 1256 (1977).</P>
    <P>
    <B>Section only changes the procedure.</B>The substance of the
    defendant's right to a jury trial on the question of insanity
    has been preserved; the procedure only has been changed. Ingles
    v. People, 92 Colo. 518, 22 P.2d 1109 (1933); Mundy v. People,
    105 Colo. 547, 100 P.2d 584 (1940).</P>
    <P>
    <B>And it is to be liberally construed in favor of
    defendants.</B>Martinez v. People, 179 Colo. 197, 499 P.2d 611
    (1972).</P>
    <P>
    <B>"Just determination" inquiry or determination regarding
    imposition of a mental status defense over the objection of the
    defendant</B>requires a balancing of the public's interest in
    not holding criminally liable a defendant lacking criminal
    responsibility and the defendant's interest in autonomously
    controlling the nature of person's defense. Under subsection
    (2) and § 16-8-103.5 (2) the court must consider not only the
    defendant's stated reasons for objecting to the mental status
    defenses at the time of arraignment--but also the defendant's
    state of mind at the time of the commission of the offense.
    Against this, the court must consider the defendant's reasons
    for attempting to forego assertion of the mental status defense
    by examining whether those reasons satisfy a "basic
    rationality" inquiry. Hendricks v. People, 10 P.3d 1231 (Colo.
    2000).</P>
    <P>Trial court must first consider the viability of the mental
    status defense that defense counsel requests the court to
    assert on behalf of the defendant. This requires the court to
    assess the mental state of the defendant at the time of the
    commission of the offense to determine whether there is
    substantial evidence that the defendant may not be guilty
    because of the defendant's mental status. Hendricks v. People,
    10 P.3d 1231 (Colo. 2000).</P>
    <P>Defendant's choice should be accorded substantial weight in
    evaluating whether imposition of a mental status defense
    results in a "just determination of the charge against the
    defendant". At the same time it is inappropriate to give weight
    to a defendant's choice if the choice is founded in the
    defendant's delusions or is otherwise devoid of a rational
    basis. To satisfy this inquiry the trial court must assess
    whether the defendant's reason for the decision has a plausible
    grounding in reality. Hendricks v. People, 10 P.3d 1231 (Colo.
    2000).</P>
    <P>A finding of competency to stand trial does not substitute
    for a finding of basic rationality. Hendricks v. People, 10
    P.3d 1231 (Colo. 2000).</P>
    <P>An individual's interest in autonomously controlling the
    nature of his or her defense, provided that interest is
    premised on a choice that satisfies the basic rationality test,
    will predominate over the broader interest of society unless
    pressing concerns mandate a contrary result. Hendricks v.
    People, 10 P.3d 1231 (Colo. 2000).</P>
    <P>
    <B>It is mandatory</B>to the extent that it requires a
    defendant who intends to defend on the ground of insanity to
    interpose an appropriate plea. But this does not mean that this
    section operates to exclude every other possible mental
    examination of an accused. Early v. People, 142 Colo. 462, 352
    P.2d 112, cert. denied, 364 U.S. 847, 81 S. Ct. 90, 5 L. Ed. 2d
    70 (1960).</P>
    <P>A defendant desiring to rely upon insanity as a defense in a
    criminal action is bound to comply with the provisions of this
    section concerning the entry of such plea. Robbins v. People,
    142 Colo. 254, 350 P.2d 818 (1960).</P>
    <P>
    <B>But it does not compel self-incrimination.</B>Since a
    defendant under a plea of not guilty can offer evidence of his
    insanity bearing upon his ability to form criminal intent, it
    cannot be said that he is compelled to enter a plea of not
    guilty by reason of insanity under this section and his
    election to do so cannot be held compulsory incrimination.
    Castro v. People, 140 Colo. 493, 346 P.2d 1020 (1959).</P>
    <P>
    <B>Where the defendant does not enter a special plea raising
    the defense of insanity,</B>any evidence introduced at his
    trial which would support such a plea is irrelevant and
    inadmissible. People v. Low, 732 P.2d 622 (Colo. 1987).</P>
    <P>
    <B>Rationale for excusing from criminal responsibility.</B>A
    person who is criminally insane is excused from criminal
    responsibility for his actions because, due to a mental disease
    or defect, he lacks the capacity to distinguish right from
    wrong with respect to the act or to adhere to the right or
    refrain from the wrong. Hendershott v. People, 653 P.2d 385
    (Colo. 1982), cert. denied, 459 U.S. 1225, 103 S. Ct. 1232, 75
    L. Ed. 2d 466 (1983).</P>
    <P>
    <B>Insane persons are not necessarily incompetent to stand
    trial</B>because of the fact of their insanity. People v.
    Benns, 641 P.2d 298 (Colo. App. 1981).</P>
    <P>
    <B>Putting accused on trial while he is incompetent violates
    due process of law.</B>Jones v. District Court, 617 P.2d 803
    (Colo. 1980).</P>
    <P>
    <B>And prohibition attaches at commencement of formal criminal
    proceedings and continues throughout</B>the execution and
    satisfaction of the sentence. Jones v. District Court, 617 P.2d
    803 (Colo. 1980).</P>
    <P>
    <B>Defense counsel to bring belief of accused's incompetence to
    court's attention.</B>When defense counsel has reason to
    believe the accused is incompetent, he is obliged to bring this
    matter to the court's attention even though it might be to the
    disadvantage of the accused. Jones v. District Court, 617 P.2d
    803 (Colo. 1980).</P>
    <P>
    <B>And court to inquire where issue of competency
    raised.</B>Where defense attorney's representation to the court
    raised a substantial issue as to the petitioner's competency to
    stand trial, trial court's refusal to make any inquiry into
    that issue or to receive any evidence in that regard
    constituted an abuse of discretion. Jones v. District Court,
    617 P.2d 803 (Colo. 1980).</P>
    <P>
    <B>Or due process is violated</B>when a trial court refuses to
    accord an accused an adequate hearing on his claimed
    incompetency to stand trial. Jones v. District Court, 617 P.2d
    803 (Colo. 1980).</P>
    <P>
    <B>Choice of entering plea left to defendant.</B>The tactical
    choice of whether to enter a plea of not guilty by reason of
    insanity by a defendant found "mentally competent" is left to
    the defendant and his counsel. People v. Lopez, 640 P.2d 275
    (Colo. App. 1982).</P>
    <P>When a defendant is competent to proceed, the tactical
    choice whether to utilize the affirmative defense of insanity
    should be left up to the defendant and his counsel. People v.
    Benns, 641 P.2d 298 (Colo. App. 1981).</P>
    <P>
    <B>No authority for court to raise defense unless requested by
    defendant.</B>Neither Crim. P. 11(e) nor this section gives a
    trial court the authority to enter a plea of not guilty by
    reason of insanity when it has not been requested by the
    defendant or his counsel. Labor v. Gibson, 195 Colo. 416, 578
    P.2d 1059 (1978); People v. Lopez, 640 P.2d 275 (Colo. App.
    1982).</P>
    <P>
    <B>Claim of incompetence to stand trial on issue of guilt
    cannot be waived.</B>Jones v. District Court, 617 P.2d 803
    (Colo. 1980).</P>
    <P>
    <B>Entitled to instruction on commitment procedures.</B>A
    defendant who is relying on an insanity defense is entitled,
    upon request, to an instruction on commitment procedures.
    People v. Thomson, 197 Colo. 232, 591 P.2d 1031 (1979); People
    v. Osborn, 42 Colo. App. 376, 599 P.2d 937 (1979); People v.
    Beasley, 43 Colo. App. 488, 608 P.2d 835 (1979).</P>
    <P>The court should give a jury instruction which clearly and
    simply explains the consequences to the defendant of an
    insanity verdict. Such an instruction should clearly indicate
    that it is only informational and is to have no persuasive
    bearing on the jury's determination of a proper verdict. People
    v. Roark, 643 P.2d 756 (Colo. 1982).</P>
    <P>
    <B>People v. Thomson should be applied retroactively</B>in
    those cases in which an instruction on commitment procedures
    has been requested and judgment of conviction is not final.
    People v. Hardin, 199 Colo. 229, 607 P.2d 1291 (1980).</P>

    <ANNO-TEXT>
    <B>Previously the question of insanity could be raised under a
    general plea of not guilty.</B>In order to avoid or lessen
    certain abuses that were believed to exist under that practice,
    the general assembly changed the method of raising the question
    of insanity, but left to the defendant all the substantial
    rights he formerly enjoyed. Ingles v. People, 92 Colo. 518, 22
    P.2d 1109 (1933).

    <P>
    <B>The plea of not guilty by reason of insanity is in the

    <P>
    <B>It is a plea on the merits because it attacks the mental

    of guilt. Parks v. Denver District Court, 180 Colo. 202, 503
    P.2d 1029 (1972).</P>
    <P>
    <B>By asserting insanity a defendant admits the acts charged,
    but denies criminal culpability.</B>However, such admission
    extends only and solely to the consideration of such plea;
    beyond that it has no efficacy in a criminal case. Leick v.
    People, 136 Colo. 535, 322 P.2d 674, cert. denied, 357 U.S.

    <P>
    <B>Permitting change of plea is within discretion of
    court.</B>Where good cause is shown, it is incumbent on the
    trial court to allow changes of plea or additional pleas to
    accomplish the fair and just determination of criminal charges.
    Whether good cause is shown rests within the sound discretion
    of the trial court, and in the absence of a showing of an abuse
    of discretion by the trial court, the supreme court will not
    disturb its ruling. Gallegos v. People, 166 Colo. 409, 444 P.2d
    267 (1968).</P>
    <P>Trial court's determination of lack of good cause shown for
    permitting insanity defense will be affirmed unless there has

    499 P.2d 611 (1972).</P>
    <P>Whether good cause is shown to permit a plea of insanity
    rests within the sound discretion of the trial court, and in
    the absence of a showing of an abuse of discretion by the trial
    court, an appellate court will not disturb its ruling. Taylor

    People, 200 Colo. 62, 612 P.2d 85 (1980).</P>
    <P>
    <B>Good cause shown.</B>Good cause is shown when the defendant
    establishes that the plea was not entered at arraignment
    because of mistake, ignorance, or inadvertence, and that
    fairness and justice will best be served by permitting the
    additional plea. Ellis v. District Court, 189 Colo. 123, 538
    P.2d 107 (1975); People v. Reed, 692 P.2d 1150 (Colo. App.
    1984).</P>
    <P>
    <B>Where good cause not found.</B>Where defense counsel
    forcefully argues that he has demonstrated good cause through
    his showing that defendant lied to him about his real identity
    and his past criminal record and said that he had some mental
    problems, this did not establish good cause. Garza v. People,
    200 Colo. 62, 612 P.2d 85 (1980).</P>
    <P>
    <B>Denial, for lack of good cause, of request to add insanity
    plea held not abuse of discretion.</B>Martinez v. People, 179
    Colo. 197, 499 P.2d 611 (1972).</P>
    <P>Where four and one half months after a plea of not guilty to
    a charge of murder has been entered, a jury selected and sworn,
    counsel for the defendant is advised that defendant may be
    subject to epilepsy, and thereupon requests the court to order
    a mistrial and to permit defendant to enter a plea of "not
    guilty by reason of insanity", the refusal of the trial court
    to grant such requests is not an abuse of discretion where the
    record discloses that the trial court carefully investigated
    the matter in the course of which competent medical advice was
    sought and received following an examination of the defendant.
    Robbins v. People, 142 Colo. 254, 350 P.2d 818 (1960).</P>
    <P>
    <B>Court acted arbitrarily in denying leave to plead
    defense.</B>Prior to arraignment, counsel for defendant had
    discussed the insanity defense with him, but defendant did not
    want to plead not guilty by reason of insanity and counsel
    agreed. However, when defendant was severed from his
    codefendants for trial, he disclosed new evidence to his
    counsel, which led counsel to the discovery of other evidence
    indicative of a foundation for insanity pleas, and, on the
    basis of this new knowledge, counsel again discussed the
    possibility of the insanity defense with him, and he then
    stated that he wanted to so plead. On the basis of this
    showing, the trial court acted arbitrarily in denying leave to
    plead the defense of insanity. Taylor v. District Court, 182

    <P>Defendant withdrew his plea of not guilty by reason of

    acquittal on the ground that he was incapable of forming the
    general intent to commit a crime. Russell v. People, 155 Colo.
    422, 395 P.2d 16 (1964).</P>
    <P>On a trial of the issue of guilt after defendant was

    Rupert v. People, 163 Colo. 219, 429 P.2d 276 (1967).</P>
    <P>
    <B>Evidence of mental condition admissible as bearing on
    specific intent.</B>Upon trial of issues framed by a plea of
    not guilty, any evidence bearing on the mental condition of the
    accused, including evidence of legal insanity, is admissible as
    bearing on the ability to deliberate and form the intent
    essential to murder in the first degree. Leick v. People, 131
    Colo. 353, 281 P.2d 806 (1955).</P>
    <P>This section provides that evidence of mental condition may
    be offered regardless of whether a plea of not guilty by reason
    of insanity has been interposed. Castro v. People, 140 Colo.
    493, 346 P.2d 1020 (1959).</P>
    <P>Evidence of insanity or mental deficiency is relevant in a
    criminal trial, notwithstanding the fact that defendant has
    merely entered a plea of not guilty, as bearing upon the
    capacity of the accused to form a specific intent essential to
    the crime. Early v. People, 42 Colo. 462, 352 P.2d 112, cert.
    denied, 364 U.S. 847, 81 S. Ct. 90, 5 L. Ed. 2d 70 (1960).</P>
    <P>A defendant is entitled under the proviso of this section to
    adduce evidence bearing upon his capacity to form the
    particular intent essential to constitute the crime of
    felonious escape. Gallegos v. People, 159 Colo. 379, 411 P.2d
    956 (1966).</P>
    <P>A line of testimony regarding mental condition is proper on
    a trial on the issue of guilt after defendant was adjudged
    sane, but only for the very limited purpose of whether
    testimony bears upon the capacity of the accused to form a
    specific intent essential to constitute a crime. Rupert v.
    People, 163 Colo. 219, 429 P.2d 276 (1967).</P>
    <P>
    <B>Or to reduce the grade of the crime.</B>A defendant pleading
    not guilty may introduce evidence of mental condition for the
    purpose not of securing an acquittal, but of reducing the grade
    of the crime. Ingles v. People, 92 Colo. 518, 22 P.2d 1109
    (1933).</P>
    <P>
    <B>Or in mitigation of sentence.</B>A defendant may introduce
    evidence of mental derangement at the time of the commission of
    the homicide for the purpose of enabling the jury to determine,
    in the exercise of its discretion, whether to fix the penalty
    at death or imprisonment for life, should it find him guilty of
    first degree murder. Ingles v. People, 92 Colo. 518, 22 P.2d
    1109 (1933).</P>
    <P>
    <B>And court may limit jury determination to issue of specific
    intent.</B>After defendant withdrew his plea of not guilty due
    to insanity, the trial court was correct in limiting medical
    testimony on defendant's emotional age to the determination by
    the jury as to whether defendant could form a specific intent.
    Russell v. People, 155 Colo. 422, 395 P.2d 16 (1964).</P>
    <P>
    <B>But refusal to admit such evidence would deny due
    process.</B>A refusal on the part of a trial court to admit
    evidence of mental condition, including evidence of legal
    insanity, would be a denial of due process of law. Leick v.
    People, 131 Colo. 353, 281 P.2d 806 (1955).</P>
    <P>
    <B>Defendant who withdrew his plea of not guilty by reason of
    insanity could not complain regarding a jury
    instruction</B>which failed to indicate that insanity resulting
    from involuntary intoxication could mitigate first degree
    murder. People v. Manier, 184 Colo. 44, 518 P.2d 811

    <P>
    <B>The affirmative defense of impaired mental condition is
    separate and distinct from the defense of insanity;</B>its sole
    effect is to negate the existence of an element of the crime

    of impaired mental condition at trial, he must also specially
    plead the defense at arraignment. People v. Bolton, 859 P.2d
    311 (Colo. App. 1993).</P>
    <P>
    <B>Exclusion of impaired mental condition defense for
    noncompliance with discovery order</B>by reason of prejudice to
    prosecution was not an abuse of discretion where defendant was
    examined six months prior to trial and at a time when he was
    represented by counsel, yet only declared his intention to use
    a defense of impaired mental condition just before trial, and
    no events occurred after non-compliance which mitigated
    prejudice to prosecution. People v. Reger, 731 P.2d 752 (Colo.

    <P>
    <B>Testimony relating to an impaired mental condition defense

    section and § 16-8-103.6 are not met. People v. Sandoval, 805
    P.2d 1126 (Colo. App. 1990).</P>
    <P>
    <B>Admissible medical testimony relating to an impaired mental
    condition</B>need not arise out an examination concerning
    precisely the issue of impaired mental condition. No such
    limitation is found in this section or § 16-8-103.6. People v.
    Sandoval, 805 P.2d 1126 (Colo. App. 1990).</P>
    <P>
    <B>"Just determination" inquiry or determination regarding
    imposition of a mental status defense over the objection of the
    defendant</B>requires a balancing of the public's interest in
    not holding criminally liable a defendant lacking criminal
    responsibility and the defendant's interest in autonomously
    controlling the nature of person's defense. Under subsection
    (2) and § 16-8-103 (2) the court must consider not only the
    defendant's stated reasons for objecting to the mental status
    defenses at the time of arraignment--but also the defendant's
    state of mind at the time of the commission of the offense.
    Against this, the court must consider the defendant's reasons
    for attempting to forego assertion of the mental status defense
    by examining whether those reasons satisfy a "basic
    rationality" inquiry. Hendricks v. People, 10 P.3d 1231 (Colo.
    2000).</P>
    <P>Trial court must first consider the viability of the mental
    status defense that defense counsel requests the court to
    assert on behalf of the defendant. This requires the court to
    assess the mental state of the defendant at the time of the
    commission of the offense to determine whether there is
    substantial evidence that the defendant may not be guilty
    because of the defendant's mental status. Hendricks v. People,
    10 P.3d 1231 (Colo. 2000).</P>
    <P>Defendant's choice should be accorded substantial weight in
    evaluating whether imposition of a mental status defense
    results in a "just determination of the charge against the
    defendant". At the same time it is inappropriate to give weight
    to a defendant's choice if the choice is founded in the
    defendant's delusions or is otherwise devoid of a rational
    basis. To satisfy this inquiry the trial court must assess
    whether the defendant's reason for the decision has a plausible
    grounding in reality. Hendricks v. People, 10 P.3d 1231 (Colo.
    2000).</P>
    <P>A finding of competency to stand trial does not substitute
    for a finding of basic rationality. Hendricks v. People, 10
    P.3d 1231 (Colo. 2000).</P>
    <P>An individual's interest in autonomously controlling the
    nature of his or her defense, provided that interest is
    premised on a choice that satisfies the basic rationality test,
    will predominate over the broader interest of society unless
    pressing concerns mandate a contrary result. Hendricks v.

    <P>A defendant who places his or her mental condition at issue

    work product doctrine, any work product actually generated by
    defense counsel that is in an expert's file must be reviewed by
    the trial court and excised from the file before the file is
    disclosed to the prosecution. People v. Ullery, 964 P.2d 539

    <P>
    <B>Legislative intent.</B>By enactment of this section, the
    general assembly intended that the issues of guilt and legal
    accountability be completely separated for trial purposes.
    People v. King, 181 Colo. 439, 510 P.2d 333 (1973); People v.
    Morgan, 637 P.2d 338 (Colo. 1981).</P>
    <P>
    <B>This section relates to the order of trial of issues
    raised</B>by the separate and distinct pleas which may be
    entered by an accused. Martin v. District Court, 129 Colo. 27,
    272 P.2d 648 (1954).</P>
    <P>This section provides for the order of trial of an offense
    where an insanity plea is joined with other pleas. Leick v.
    People, 136 Colo. 535, 322 P.2d 674, cert. denied, 357 U.S.
    922, 78 S. Ct. 1363, 2 L. Ed. 2d 1366 (1958).</P>
    <P>
    <B>A separation of the issues for trial does not deny due
    process of law.</B>Leick v. People, 131 Colo. 353, 281 P.2d 806
    (1955).</P>
    <P>
    <B>Or other constitutional rights.</B>The right to a trial by a
    jury of 12, the right to a speedy public trial by an impartial
    jury, due process, and other constitutional rights are not
    violated because the trial of the issues separately results in
    one trial. Leick v. People, 136 Colo. 535, 322 P.2d 674, cert.
    denied, 357 U.S. 922, 78 S. Ct. 1363, 2 L. Ed. 2d 1366
    (1958).</P>
    <P>
    <B>Purpose of separate trials.</B>Separate trials of the issues
    of guilt and of mental condition are provided to safeguard, as
    far as possible, against the prejudice likely to arise in the
    minds of a jury trying both the issue of guilt and of mental
    condition by reason of the wide variety of evidence which might
    be competent on the issue of insanity and which would not be
    admissible upon trial of the not guilty plea. Trujillo v.
    People, 150 Colo. 235, 372 P.2d 86 (1962).</P>
    <P>The bifurcated trial was designed to eliminate many
    constitutional challenges where the issues of insanity and
    guilt were resolved in the unitary trial. Lewis v. Thulemeyer,
    189 Colo. 139, 538 P.2d 441 (1975).</P>
    <P>
    <B>Purpose of sanity trial limited.</B>A sanity trial is
    designed to determine whether the defendant was sane or insane
    at the time of the alleged offense, and the issue of guilt or
    innocence plays no part in the resolution of this issue. People
    v. Morgan, 637 P.2d 338 (Colo. 1981).</P>
    <P>
    <B>Separate trials utilize separate juries.</B>In Colorado
    there are two separate and distinct trials, utilizing two
    separate and distinct juries, whenever the plea of not guilty
    by reason of insanity is raised. Lewis v. People, 174 Colo.
    334, 483 P.2d 949 (1971).</P>
    <P>In a proceeding under this section, if the cause is set for
    trial to the jury on the issue of insanity only, and the
    defendant is found sane, then the defendant shall be tried on
    the issue of guilt at a later time to a different jury. People
    v. Kernanen, 178 Colo. 234, 497 P.2d 8 (1972).</P>
    <P>
    <B>Which constitute but one trial.</B>This section provides for
    disposition of a plea of insanity in a criminal case before
    trial of the issue of not guilty; although such issues are
    tried separately, they constitute but one trial. Leick v.
    People, 136 Colo. 535, 322 P.2d 674, cert. denied, 357 U.S.
    922, 78 S. Ct. 1363, 2 L. Ed. 2d 1366 (1958).</P>
    <P>Under the procedure permitting a disposition of the insanity
    issue before the issue of not guilty, the trial is conducted in
    sections which together constitute one trial. The action is
    single. People ex rel. Juhan v. District Court, 165 Colo. 253,
    439 P.2d 741 (1968).</P>
    <P>
    <B>And a single judgment to the charge results.</B>Where there
    is but a single charge to which a defendant pleads not guilty
    by reason of insanity at the time of the commission of the
    offense and the further plea of not guilty, and the issues so
    raised are tried separately, a single judgment only could be
    entered. Leick v. People, 136 Colo. 535, 322 P.2d 674, cert.
    denied, 357 U.S. 922, 78 S. Ct. 1363, 2 L. Ed. 2d 1366
    (1958).</P>
    <P>
    <B>Procedure does not make trial a civil case.</B>The fact that
    the issue of insanity defense has been separated from other
    questions for the purpose of trial does not make a civil case
    out of that which is tendered as a defense to an accusation of
    crime. Castro v. People, 140 Colo. 493, 346 P.2d 1020 (1959);
    People ex rel. Juhan v. District Court, 165 Colo. 253, 439 P.2d
    741 (1968).</P>
    <P>
    <B>However, in the sanity trial, defendant's testimony is not
    considered within the same constitutional guarantees</B>as it
    is in the guilt trial. It is not error for the judge to not
    give a Curtis advisement concerning the right to testify and
    previous convictions. People v. Chou, 981 P.2d 668 (Colo. App.
    1999).</P>
    <P>
    <B>And proof beyond a reasonable doubt is required of issues in
    separate trial.</B>By procedurally requiring a separate trial
    on the issue of mental capacity to commit any crime -- which
    admittedly is a necessary ingredient of any offense -- the
    material ingredient set apart for separate trial shall be
    governed by all the firmly established doctrine that as to
    every necessary ingredient of the total crime there must be
    proof beyond a reasonable doubt. People ex rel. Juhan v.
    District Court, 165 Colo. 253, 439 P.2d 741 (1968).</P>
    <P>In Colorado, the sanity trial stands on the same footing
    with the trial on the other elements of the crime. Parks v.
    Denver District Court, 180 Colo. 202, 503 P.2d 1029 (1972).</P>
    <P>
    <B>In considering a motion for a directed verdict in a sanity
    trial under this section, the trial court must consider the
    evidence,</B>together with reasonable inferences therefrom, in
    the light most favorable to the people, and, if there is
    substantial competent evidence to support a verdict in favor of
    the people, the motion must be denied and the matter submitted
    to the jury for determination. People v. King, 181 Colo. 439,
    510 P.2d 333 (1973).</P>
    <P>
    <B>Defendant was not placed in double jeopardy on insanity
    issue.</B>Where defendant, charged with homicide, moved for a
    separate trial on the sanity issue as provided by this section,
    he was not placed in double jeopardy where the trial court's
    direction of verdict of insanity was held erroneous and the
    defendant was retried on the sanity issue. People v. King, 181
    Colo. 439, 510 P.2d 333 (1973).</P>
    <P>
    <B>Grant of new trial on sanity does not require new trial on
    merits.</B>When a separate sanity trial has been held which
    results in an erroneous verdict requiring a new sanity trial,
    it is not necessary to also grant a new trial on the merits
    where there is no prejudicial error in the trial of the
    substantive charge. Young v. People, 175 Colo. 461, 488 P.2d
    567 (1971); Lewis v. People, 174 Colo. 334, 483 P.2d 949
    (1971).</P>
    <P>
    <B>Admission of psychiatric report on sanity but not guilt
    issues.</B>The general assembly, in providing for the admission
    in evidence of defendant's statements to the psychiatrist where
    sanity is the issue, but barring them on the guilt issue, does
    not violate the defendant's rights against self-incrimination.
    Lewis v. Thulemeyer, 189 Colo. 139, 538 P.2d 441 (1975).</P>
    <P>The use of the confessions or admissions of the defendant in
    the decisional process by the psychiatrist in forming an
    opinion as to the sanity or insanity of the defendant does not
    aid in the proof of guilt, but is limited to the issue of
    sanity. Lewis v. Thulemeyer, 189 Colo. 139, 538 P.2d 441
    (1975).</P>
    <P>
    <B>No self-incrimination.</B>When the sanity issue is a
    separate proceeding, as it is in Colorado, before a jury that
    cannot consider the issue of guilt in the event the defendant
    is found sane and where the admissions cannot be used to
    establish guilt, there is no self-incrimination within the
    contemplation of the constitutional provisions. Lewis v.
    Thulemeyer, 189 Colo. 139, 538 P.2d 441 (1975).</P>
    <P>
    <B>Joinder of a charge of forcible rape with an unrelated
    deviate sexual intercourse charge</B>committed on a different
    female on a different date for purposes of trial on the sanity
    issue was not error. People v. Renfrow, 193 Colo. 131, 564 P.2d
    411 (1977).</P>
    <P>
    <B>Sanity trial jury not instructed on substantive
    elements.</B>A trial court is correct to refuse to instruct the
    jury at a sanity trial on the elements and culpable mental
    states of the substantive offenses with which the defendant is
    charged. People v. Morgan, 637 P.2d 338 (Colo. 1981).</P>
    <P>
    <B>Motion for new trial after trial on merits preserves for
    appeal errors alleged in sanity trial</B>because the judgment
    declaring the defendant sane is not final for appeal purposes
    until defendant is found guilty of the crime charged. People v.
    Osborn, 42 Colo. App. 376, 599 P.2d 937 (1979).</P>

  <M>Procedure after plea for offenses committed before July 1,
  1995.</M></CATCH-LINE>(1)
  <M>When a plea of not guilty by reason of insanity is accepted,
  the court shall forthwith commit the defendant for a sanity
  examination, specifying the place and period of commitment.</M>
  <P N="(2)">(2)
  <M>Upon receiving the report of the sanity examination, the court
  shall immediately set the case for trial to a jury on the issue
  raised by the plea of not guilty by reason of insanity. In all
  cases except class 1, class 2, and class 3 felonies, the
  defendant may waive jury trial by an express written instrument
  or announcement in open court appearing of record. If the court
  and the district attorney consent, jury trial may be waived in a
  class 1, class 2, or class 3 felony case. Every person is
  presumed to be sane; but, once any evidence of insanity is
  introduced, the people have the burden of proving sanity beyond a
  reasonable doubt.</M></P>
  <P N="(3)">(3)
  <M>If the trier of fact finds the defendant was sane at the time
  of commission of the offense, the court, unless it has reason to
  believe that the defendant is incompetent to proceed or the
  question is otherwise raised as provided in section 16-8.5-102,
  shall immediately set the case for trial on the issues raised by
  the plea of not guilty. If the question of whether the defendant
  is incompetent to proceed is raised, the court shall follow the
  procedure set forth in section 16-8.5-103.</M></P>
  <P N="(4)">(4)
  <M>If the trier of fact finds the defendant not guilty by reason
  of insanity, the court shall commit the defendant to the custody
  of the department of human services until such time as he is
  found eligible for release. The executive director of the
  department of human services shall designate the state facility
  at which the defendant shall be held for care and psychiatric
  treatment and may transfer the defendant from one institution to
  another if in the opinion of the director it is desirable to do
  so in the interest of the proper care, custody, and treatment of
  the defendant or the protection of the public or the personnel of
  the facilities in question.</M></P>

    <P>
    <B>Annotator's note.</B>Since § 16-8-105 is similar to repealed
    § 39-8-3, C.R.S. 1963, § 39-8-3, CRS 53, CSA, C. 48, § 509, and
    laws antecedent thereto, relevant cases construing those
    provisions have been included in the annotations to this
    section.</P>
    <P>
    <B>This section is constitutional.</B>This section is valid and
    does not deprive an accused of due process of law. Castro v.
    People, 140 Colo. 493, 346 P.2d 1020 (1959).</P>
    <P>This section is constitutional and its adoption was a valid
    exercise of legislative power. Bell v. People, 158 Colo. 146,
    406 P.2d 681 (1965), cert. denied, 384 U.S. 1024, 86 S. Ct.
    1964, 16 L. Ed. 2d 1027, reh'g denied, 385 U.S. 892, 87 S. Ct.
    23, 17 L. Ed. 2d 126 (1966).</P>
    <P>Colorado's automatic commitment statute does not violate the
    due process rights of one found not guilty by reason of
    insanity, nor is equal protection violated by the fact that a
    defendant is denied the same precommitment hearing or release
    standards provided those civilly committed. People v. Fetty,
    650 P.2d 541 (Colo. 1982); Glatz v. Kort, 650 F. Supp. 191 (D.
    Colo. 1984), aff'd, 807 F.2d 1514 (10th Cir. 1986).</P>
    <P>
    <B>Insanity procedure does not compel self-incrimination.</B>No
    change in the matter of incarceration and observation is
    provided by insanity procedure from jail to hospital, and this
    is no violation of a defendant's constitutional exemption from
    testifying against himself. Castro v. People, 140 Colo. 493,
    346 P.2d 1020 (1959).</P>
    <P>The general assembly, in providing for the admission in
    evidence of defendant's statements to the psychiatrist where
    sanity is the issue, but barring them on the guilt issue, does
    not violate the defendant's rights against self-incrimination.
    Lewis v. Thulemeyer, 189 Colo. 139, 538 P.2d 441 (1975).</P>
    <P>When the sanity issue is a separate proceeding, as it is in
    Colorado, before a jury that cannot consider the issue of guilt
    in the event the defendant is found sane and where the
    admissions cannot be used to establish guilt, there is no
    self-incrimination within the contemplation of the
    constitutional provisions. Lewis v. Thulemeyer, 189 Colo. 139,
    538 P.2d 441 (1975).</P>
    <P>
    <B>Refusal to cooperate in examination does not forfeit
    defense.</B>A person accused of a crime who enters a plea of
    not guilty by reason of insanity cannot be compelled to carry
    on conversations against his will under the penalty of
    forfeiture of the defense for failure to respond to questions,
    or for a refusal to "cooperate" with persons appointed to
    examine him. Section 16-8-106 and this section, which prescribe
    the procedures to be followed upon the entry of a plea of not
    guilty by reason of insanity, cannot operate to destroy the
    constitutional safeguards against self-incrimination. French v.
    District Court, 153 Colo. 10, 384 P.2d 268 (1963).</P>
    <P>
    <B>This section can have but one meaning; the commitment must
    follow immediately after the entry of the plea.</B>It fixes a
    period of time intervening between the date on which a
    defendant enters his plea and the date on which the issues thus
    raised shall be tried. Within this intervening period, and
    "forthwith" upon the entry of the plea, the commitment for
    observation and examination must be made. Martin v. District
    Court, 129 Colo. 27, 272 P.2d 648 (1954).</P>
    <P>
    <B>Trial may not precede commitment.</B>Where one accused of a
    felony enters pleas of "not guilty" and "not guilty by reason
    of insanity", it is not permissible to try defendant on the
    issues raised by his not guilty plea prior to any commitment
    for observation and examination as required by § 16-8-106.
    Martin v. District Court, 129 Colo. 27, 272 P.2d 648
    (1954).</P>
    <P>
    <B>Primary purpose of immediate commitment</B>is to furnish the
    state with an opportunity to assess the defendant's mental
    status and to determine whether he likely will pose a danger to
    himself or others upon his release. People v. Chavez, 629 P.2d
    1040 (Colo. 1981).</P>
    <P>
    <B>Judicially determined doubt as to accused's sanity provides
    sufficient warrant for immediate commitment</B>and further
    examination as to his present mental condition. People v.
    Chavez, 629 P.2d 1040 (Colo. 1981).</P>
    <P>
    <B>Commitment proceedings require due process
    consideration.</B>Commitment to a mental institution
    constitutes a severe infringement on the basic interest of an
    individual to be free from governmental restraint and, thus,
    requires due process protection. People v. Chavez, 629 P.2d
    1040 (Colo. 1981).</P>
    <P>
    <B>Insanity plea not allowed in probation revocation
    proceeding.</B>A court, in permitting a plea of "not guilty by
    reason of insanity" in a probation revocation hearing, exceeds
    its jurisdiction, as a plea of not guilty by reason of insanity
    is not a proper means of testing competency at such a hearing.

    <ANNO-TEXT>
    <B>Insanity procedure is criminal in nature.</B>Procedure under
    this section is not violative of the state or federal
    constitutions as intermingling criminal and civil proceedings
    in one trial. Castro v. People, 140 Colo. 493, 346 P.2d 1020
    (1959). 
    <P>The fact that the issue of insanity is separated from other
    questions for the purpose of trial does not make a civil case
    out of that which is tendered as a defense to an accusation of
    crime. Castro v. People, 140 Colo. 493, 346 P.2d 1020 (1959);
    People ex rel. Juhan v. District Court, 165 Colo. 253, 439 P.2d
    741 (1968).</P>
    <P>Insanity at the time of the commission of the offense is not
    a mitigating factor that relieves the accused of punishment,
    but is a complete defense to the criminal charge. Parks v.
    Denver District Court, 180 Colo. 202, 503 P.2d 1029 (1972).</P>
    <P>
    <B>The separate sanity trial determines finally guilt of
    defendant as to an essential ingredient of the crime;</B>mental
    capacity to commit a crime is a material part of total guilt
    for there can be no crime without the mens rea. People ex rel.
    Juhan v. District Court, 165 Colo. 253, 439 P.2d 741
    (1968).</P>
    <P>
    <B>And the question of sanity or insanity is solely one for the
    jury.</B>Sherrill v. People, 75 Colo. 401, 225 P. 840 (1924);
    Wymer v. People, 114 Colo. 43, 160 P.2d 987 (1945); Palmer v.
    People, 162 Colo. 92, 424 P.2d 766 (1967).</P>
    <P>The determination of the issue of insanity, when raised, is
    solely within the province of the jury. Henderson v. People,
    156 Colo. 229, 397 P.2d 872 (1965).</P>
    <P>The question of sanity in a criminal case is an issue of
    fact to be determined by the trier of fact. People v. Wright,
    648 P.2d 665 (Colo. 1982).</P>
    <P>
    <B>Jury trial may be waived.</B>This section requiring that if
    defense waives jury trial on the issue of insanity in a
    first-degree murder prosecution, it must secure consent of
    district attorney, is constitutional and not violative of
    defense right to waive trial by jury. People v. Brisbin, 175
    Colo. 428, 488 P.2d 63 (1971); People v. Kernanen, 178 Colo.
    234, 497 P.2d 8 (1972); People v. District Court, 731 P.2d 720
    (Colo. 1987).</P>
    <P>The order of proof before the jury is discretionary with the
    court for there is no requirement that the prosecution
    initially produce its experts in its case in chief. Elliott v.
    People, 176 Colo. 373, 490 P.2d 687 (1971).</P>
    <P>Statutory requirement that prosecution consent to waiver of
    jury in sanity trial applied to trial of defendant prosecuted
    for second-degree murder rather than subsequently enacted
    general statute, § 18-1-406 (2), which did not refer to
    prosecutor's consent to waiver of jury trial. People v.
    District Court, 731 P.2d 720 (Colo. 1987).</P>
    <P>Distinction between classes of felonies where consent of
    court and prosecution must be obtained and those classes for
    which consent is not required before waiver of jury trial will
    be permitted in a sanity trial has rational foundation. People
    v. District Court, 731 P.2d 720 (Colo. 1987).</P>
    <P>
    <B>And the prosecution may fortify the presumption of
    sanity</B>by the presentation of evidence tending to establish
    the fact of sanity. Henderson v. People, 156 Colo. 229, 397
    P.2d 872 (1965).</P>
    <P>
    <B>And introduce evidence of sanity as case in chief.</B>Where
    a defendant by cross-examination of the people's witnesses
    produces evidence rebutting the presumption of sanity, it is
    incumbent on the prosecution to prove the sanity of defendant
    as part of its case in chief, and it is not error to receive
    such evidence. Castro v. People, 140 Colo. 493, 346 P.2d 1020
    (1959).</P>
    <P>
    <B>Evidence of normal or abnormal conduct is relevant on sanity
    issue.</B>A much wider area of conduct on the part of a
    defendant can be made the subject of inquiry in a trial
    relating to his sanity than would be permissible in a trial
    upon a plea of not guilty. Any abnormal conduct, whether
    related to the act forming the basis of the accusation or not,
    may be relevant and important on the issue of his mental
    condition. Conversely, evidence of normal conduct, and actions
    reflecting the usual and ordinary under the circumstances, may
    be shown to prove sanity. Trujillo v. People, 150 Colo. 235,
    372 P.2d 86 (1962).</P>
    <P>
    <B>And jury has discretion to infer lack of mental capacity
    from appearance or conduct</B>of the accused while in their
    presence, or from the factual circumstances disclosed by the
    evidence, thus evidence of sanity should not be excluded
    whether offered as part of the case in chief or upon rebuttal.
    Henderson v. People, 156 Colo. 229, 397 P.2d 872 (1965); Palmer
    v. People, 162 Colo. 92, 424 P.2d 766 (1967).</P>
    <P>
    <B>Thus, expert testimony is not conclusive on the jury</B>and
    must be weighed along with all other testimony. Palmer v.
    People, 162 Colo. 92, 424 P.2d 766 (1967).</P>
    <P>A jury is not bound by the testimony of experts and is free
    to believe lay testimony over any other. People v. Ware, 187
    Colo. 28, 528 P.2d 224 (1974).</P>
    <P>
    <B>Neither is defendant's acknowledged status as a ward of the
    state</B>conclusive evidence of insanity. It does not follow
    from a commitment to such an institution that one necessarily
    is incapable of forming an intent to commit a crime. McConnell
    v. People, 157 Colo. 235, 402 P.2d 75 (1965).</P>
    <P>
    <B>Trial court has discretion to determine order in which
    evidence will be presented</B>at the sanity trial. People v.
    Osborn, 42 Colo. App. 376, 599 P.2d 937 (1979).</P>
    <P>The order of proof before the jury is discretionary with the
    court for there is no requirement that the prosecution
    initially produce its experts in its case in chief. Elliot v.
    People, 176 Colo. 373, 490 P.2d 687 (1971).</P>
    <P>
    <B>Scope of evidence admissible</B>on the issue of insanity is
    broad. People v. Wright, 648 P.2d 665 (Colo. 1982).</P>
    <P>
    <B>Evidence offered must touch issue.</B>While evidence going
    only to the commission of the act and to the surrounding
    circumstances is relevant, the evidence offered in some way
    must touch on the issue of whether the defendant could
    distinguish between right and wrong and adhere to the right and
    refrain from the wrong. People v. Ware, 187 Colo. 28, 528 P.2d
    224 (1974).</P>
    <P>
    <B>Defense attorney entitled to physician's
    information.</B>Where the confessions and admissions of the
    defendant have been weighed by the examining physician in
    evaluating the defendant's sanity, fairness requires that the
    prosecutor have the same information as the defense attorney.
    Lewis v. Thulemeyer, 189 Colo. 139, 538 P.2d 441 (1975).</P>
    <P>
    <B>Limited to issue of insanity.</B>The use of the confessions
    or admissions of the defendant in the decisional process by the
    psychiatrist in forming an opinion as to the sanity or insanity
    of the defendant does not aid in the proof of guilt, but it is
    perforce limited to the issue of sanity. Lewis v. Thulemeyer,
    189 Colo. 139, 538 P.2d 441 (1975).</P>
    <P>
    <B>District attorney's statement improper.</B>Where the
    district attorney in his closing argument stated that if they
    found the defendant to be insane, he would never be tried for
    the criminal act charged, this statement was improper. People
    v. Medina, 185 Colo. 101, 521 P.2d 1257 (1974).</P>
    <P>
    <B>Defendant pleading insanity entitled to have such form of
    verdict submitted.</B>Defendant pled insanity, along with his
    general plea of not guilty, which plea was never formally
    withdrawn, though in practical effect it was abandoned as no
    evidence was offered on the issue raised by the plea of
    insanity. Defendant, had he so desired, was entitled to have
    appropriate forms of verdict on this issue submitted to the
    jury. Cruz v. People, 147 Colo. 528, 364 P.2d 561 (1961), cert.
    denied, 368 U.S. 978, 82 S. Ct. 483, 7 L. Ed. 2d 440
    (1962).</P>
    <P>Upon trial neither the people nor the defendant offered any
    evidence related to the issue raised by the plea of insanity.
    Nevertheless, it was error to direct the jury to find the
    defendant sane and defendant, had he so desired, was entitled
    to have appropriate instructions on the questions of insanity
    and to have forms of verdict on this issue submitted to the
    jury. Henderson v. People, 156 Colo. 229, 397 P.2d 872
    (1965).</P>
    <P>
    <B>And verdict as to guilt does not dispose of insanity
    issue.</B>When a defendant pleads not guilty and not guilty by
    reason of insanity and at trial the defense attorney states
    that the trial will go forward on the not guilty plea, a
    verdict of guilty does not dispose of the insanity issue which
    must be tried to a jury unless the insanity plea is withdrawn.
    People v. Duran, 179 Colo. 129, 498 P.2d 937 (1972).</P>
    <P>
    <B>Error in failing to so submit verdict may be
    waived.</B>Counsel for defendant, after examining the proposed
    forms of verdict, had no objections nor did he tender any
    additional forms of verdicts. Thus, defendant cannot
    successfully predicate error on the failure of the trial court
    to submit a form of verdict on the issue raised by the insanity
    plea. Cruz v. People, 147 Colo. 528, 364 P.2d 561 (1961), cert.
    denied, 368 U.S. 978, 82 S. Ct. 483, 7 L. Ed. 2d 440
    (1962).</P>
    <P>
    <B>Instruction on status of defendant after verdict properly
    refused.</B>In a criminal case where the defense is insanity,
    the jury has no duty to perform with reference to subsequent
    orders of court after a verdict of not guilty by reason of
    insanity is returned, and a requested instruction concerning
    the status of defendant after such a verdict is properly
    refused. Ingles v. People, 90 Colo. 51, 6 P.2d 455 (1931).</P>
    <P>
    <B>Determination of insanity does not bar subsequent
    prosecution for separate crime committed hours later.</B>The
    determination by one district court that defendant was insane
    at the time of a crime committed within that district does not
    bar a subsequent prosecution in another district court for a
    separate crime committed a few hours later within that
    district. People v. Kernanen, 178 Colo. 234, 497 P.2d 8
    (1972).</P>
    <P>
    <B>But issue of sanity at time of earlier crime is
    final.</B>The doctrine of collateral estoppel affords the
    defendant the right in a subsequent sanity trial to claim
    finality with respect to the fact that he had become insane at
    the time of the commission of a crime several hours earlier in
    another county and, given this fact, the prosecution will not
    be able to prove the defendant's sanity unless it can show that
    the defendant's mental state changed abruptly sometime after
    the earlier offense was committed. People v. Kernanen, 178
    Colo. 234, 497 P.2d 8 (1972).</P>
    <P>

    forming the requisite mens rea and, therefore, he could not be
    criminally responsible for his acts, is unpersuasive where the
    defendant was found sane in a separate sanity hearing prior to
    trial on the issue of guilt, and no objection was raised as to
    the propriety of the proceedings. Johnson v. People, 174 Colo.

    <P>But defendant is required to present only some evidence of
    insanity to rebut presumption of sanity, since a presumption is
    not evidence, and the primary purpose of the presumption of

    committing the act charged, the defense being insanity, they
    must return a verdict of not guilty. Graham v. People, 95 Colo.

    <P>If, after considering all the evidence, a jury has a

    <P>In a criminal case a defendant can assert as many defenses
    as can be supported by evidence. If affirmative defenses such
    as self-defense or alibi are presented, the issues thereon are
    tried as part of the criminal case, and if any such defense
    raises in the mind of the jury a reasonable doubt as to a
    defendant's guilt he should be acquitted. The defense of

    <P>Former provision which provided that the burden shall be on

    <P>
    <B>Erroneous instruction on burden of proof requires new trial
    on sanity only.</B>Where the jury was erroneously instructed
    that the people have the burden of proving the defendant sane
    by a preponderance of the evidence, it is necessary to have a
    new trial on the issue of defendant's sanity, but the entire
    decision need not be reversed nor a new trial held on the
    merits as well. Lewis v. People, 174 Colo. 334, 483 P.2d 949
    (1971).</P>
    <P>The instruction to the jury that the defendant has the
    burden of proving by a preponderance of the evidence that he
    was insane at the time of the alleged commission of the crime
    is prejudicially erroneous and requires remand for new trial on
    sanity issue. Simms v. People, 166 Colo. 278, 443 P.2d 371
    (1968).</P>
    <P>The trial court's instruction that the burden of proof is on
    the prosecution to prove by a preponderance of the evidence
    that the defendant was sane at the time of the alleged
    commission of the crime, in harmony with the statute then in
    effect, was declared unconstitutional by the supreme court and
    the conviction is reversed and remanded for new trial on the
    issue of sanity. Johnson v. People, 172 Colo. 72, 470 P.2d 37
    (1970).</P>
    <P>When a trial judge under former provisions erroneously
    instructed the jury that the burden of proof is upon the
    defendant to establish by a preponderance of the evidence that

    <P>
    <B>Insane defendant is confined in state institution.</B>Under
    this section no matter how brutal a homicide may be, a person
    who is insane at the time of committing it cannot lawfully be
    convicted of murder, but if found guilty of committing the act,
    under former procedures for trying the issue of guilt first,
    must be confined in a state institution under the laws

    <P>
    <B>Because he is not accountable to the law.</B>A defendant
    found not guilty by reason of insanity is sent to a state
    institution, not because he is accountable to the law, but
    because he is not. In requiring him to be committed, the law is
    not in any sense holding him accountable for the homicide.
    Ingles v. People, 90 Colo. 51, 6 P.2d 455 (1931).</P>
    <P>Where petitioner was found not guilty of the crime charged
    by reason of insanity, it means that he was not legally

    <P>
    <B>And commitment is not punishment.</B>A judgment of limited
    responsibility allows one to be committed to a hospital for
    treatment and custody until he regains his sanity. This is not,

    <P>
    <B>Purpose of commitment following adjudication of not guilty
    by reason of insanity.</B>Where a defendant has been
    adjudicated not guilty by reason of insanity for acts which,
    but for his insanity, would be punishable as crimes, that
    adjudication furnishes a legitimate basis for the immediate
    commitment of the defendant to an institution for observation
    and examination, as well as any needed treatment, so that a
    reliable determination might be made of his mental condition
    and what danger, if any, he poses to himself and others. People

    <P>But, in the absence of findings that the state hospital
    staff failed to consider relevant facts and exercise competent

    defendant's treatment by private psychiatrist and payment of
    therapist from the hospital's budget. Kort v. Carlson, 723 P.2d

    <P>
    <B>Probation, recommitment, and transfer are discretionary acts

    of a mental patient from a state hospital to the penitentiary,
    provided for by Colorado law, is not only an act of discretion
    on the part of the director of state institutions but is an act
    expressly provided for and authorized by Colorado law. The
    allegation of the existence of a conspiracy between the staff
    psychiatrist and officials not to release the appellant in

  <N></N>(a)
  <M>All examinations ordered by the court in criminal cases shall
  be accomplished by the entry of an order of the court specifying
  the place where such examination is to be conducted and the
  period of time allocated for such examination. The defendant may
  be committed for such examination to the Colorado psychiatric
  hospital in Denver, the Colorado mental health institute at
  Pueblo, the place where he or she is in custody, or such other
  public institution designated by the court. In determining the
  place where such examination is to be conducted, the court shall
  give priority to the place where the defendant is in custody,
  unless the nature and circumstances of the examination require
  designation of a different facility. The defendant shall be
  observed and examined by one or more psychiatrists or forensic
  psychologists during such period as the court directs. For good
  cause shown, upon motion of the prosecution or defendant, or upon
  the court's own motion, the court may order such further or other
  examination as is advisable under the circumstances. Nothing in
  this section shall abridge the right of the defendant to procure
  an examination as provided in section 16-8-108.</M>
  <P N="(1)(b)">(b)
  <M>An interview conducted in any case that includes a class 1 or
  class 2 felony charge or a felony sex offense charge described in
  section 18-3-402, 18-3-404, 18-3-405, or 18-3-405.5, C.R.S.,
  pursuant to this section must be video and audio recorded and
  preserved. The court shall advise the defendant that any
  examination with a psychiatrist or forensic psychologist may be
  video and audio recorded. A copy of the recording must be
  provided to all parties and the court with the examination
  report. Any jail or other facility where the court orders the
  examination to take place must permit the recording to occur and
  must provide the space and equipment necessary for such
  recording. If space and equipment are not available, the sheriff
  or facility director shall attempt to coordinate a location and
  the availability of equipment with the court, which may consult
  with the district attorney and defense counsel for an agreed upon
  location. If no agreement is reached, and upon the request of
  either the defense counsel or district attorney, the court shall
  order the location of the examination, which may include the
  Colorado mental health institute at Pueblo.</M></P>

  <M>Prior to or during any examination required by this section,
  the psychiatrist or forensic psychologist shall assess whether
  the recording of the examination is likely to cause or is causing
  mental or physical harm to the defendant or others or will make
  the examination not useful to the expert forensic opinion. If
  such a determination is made and documented contemporaneously in
  writing, the psychiatrist or forensic psychologist shall not
  record the examination or shall cease recording the examination,
  and the psychiatrist or forensic psychologist shall advise the
  court and the parties of this determination and the reasons
  therefore in a written report to the court. If only a partial
  recording is made, the psychiatrist or forensic psychologist
  shall provide the partial recording to the court and the parties,
  and the partial recording may be used by any psychiatrist or
  forensic psychologist in forming an opinion, submitting a report,
  or testifying on the issue of the defendant's mental
  health.</M></P>
  <P N="(1)(c)(II)">(II)
  <M>If the examination is not recorded in whole or in part, the

  determining the weight to afford the expert witness
  testimony.</M></P>

  the defendant to call any psychiatrist, forensic psychologist, or
  other expert witness to provide evidence at the defendant's trial
  concerning the defendant's mental condition including, but not

  sentencing hearing held pursuant to section 18-1.3-1201 for an

  the defendant's trial to rebut any evidence introduced by the
  defendant with regard to the defendant's mental condition
  including, but not limited to, the issue of insanity and in any

    proceedings conducted for sentencing purposes. And, even if the
    constitutional privilege against self-incrimination is assumed
    to apply to the use of information for sentencing purposes
    after guilt has been established, the defendant waived his
    right against self-incrimination where he consented to use of

    sentencing hearing and had been apprised of his constitutional
    rights by his attorney. People v. Hernandez, 768 P.2d 755

    <P>
    <B>Requiring a defendant to cooperate during a sanity

    <P>The use of the confessions or admissions of the defendant in

    <P>
    <B>It contemplates observation as well as examination.</B>The

    <P>
    <B>And results of both processes are admissible.</B>What the
    psychiatrist learns from either observation or examination or
    from both processes, to the extent that such learning
    contributes to his opinion, is relevant and admissible in
    evidence. Johnson v. People, 172 Colo. 72, 470 P.2d 37 (1970);

    <B>Admissions to privately retained psychiatrist
    privileged.</B>The prosecution may not call, as a witness in
    its case-in-chief, a psychiatrist privately retained by the
    defendant in connection with an insanity plea and elicit from
    the psychiatrist incriminating admissions made by the defendant
    during a sanity examination. People v. Rosenthal, 617 P.2d 551
    (Colo. 1980).</P>
    <P>
    <B>But copy of report to prosecution if defense to offer
    testimony of exam.</B>The only limitation placed on a defendant
    seeking a sanity examination by a private psychiatrist is that
    a copy of the psychiatrist's report be furnished to the
    prosecution reasonably in advance of the sanity trial if the
    defense intends to offer testimony about the examination.

    <P>
    <B>Nowhere is it indicated that "examination" as used in this

    contrary, it is broadened to include conversations and other
    vital evidence from the defendant, as well as "procedures" and
    "observation". People v. Lyles, 186 Colo. 302, 526 P.2d 1332

    <P>
    <B>Refusal to cooperate with examiners does not forfeit
    defense.</B>A person accused of a crime, who enters a plea of
    not guilty by reason of insanity, cannot be compelled to carry
    on conversations against his will under the penalty of
    forfeiture of the defense for failure to respond to questions,
    or for refusal to "cooperate" with persons appointed to examine
    him. Section 16-8-105 and this section, which prescribe the
    procedures to be followed upon the entry of a plea of not
    guilty by reason of insanity, cannot operate to destroy the
    constitutional safeguards against self-incrimination. French v.
    District Court, 153 Colo. 10, 384 P.2d 268 (1963).</P>
    <P>
    <B>But defendant's noncooperation may be shown.</B>If the

    noncooperation may be shown to the jury. Johnson v. People, 172

    <P>It is permissible to use defendant's silence at a sanity
    examination as evidence of his or her sanity, especially where
    the defendant was specifically informed that, if he refused to
    cooperate with the examining physician, such noncooperation
    could be referred to at his trial and where the jurors were
    instructed that they could consider defendant's refusal to

    right of the defendant has been prejudiced, and that depends

    <P>
    <B>Annotator's note.</B>Since § 16-8-107 is similar to §
    39-8-2, C.R.S. 1963, § 39-8-2, CRS 53, and laws antecedent to
    CSA, C. 48, § 508, relevant cases construing those provisions
    have been included in the annotations to this section.</P>
    <P>
    <B>Subsection (3)(b) does not violate the separation of powers
    doctrine.</B>The statute is a mix between substantive law and
    procedural rules. People v. Bondurant, 2012 COA 50, 296 P.3d
    200.</P>
    <P>Although affecting the procedure of the courts, subsection
    (3)(b) also concerns the public policy of full disclosure in
    criminal cases involving a defense based on a defendant's
    mental condition. People v. Bondurant, 2012 COA 50, 296 P.3d
    200.</P>
    <P>
    <B>Subsection (3)(b) does not conflict with Crim. P. 11(e) or
    16, part II, in violation of the separation of powers
    doctrine.</B>People v. Bondurant, 2012 COA 50, 296 P.3d
    200.</P>
    <P>
    <B>This section is not void for vagueness.</B>The term "mental
    condition" in subsection (3)(b) includes mental illness within
    its ordinary meaning and impaired mental condition, so the
    statute is not incomprehensible in all applications. People v.
    Bondurant, 2012 COA 50, 296 P.3d 200.</P>
    <P>The term "cooperate" is capable of a common meaning. People
    v. Bondurant, 2012 COA 50, 296 P.3d 200.</P>
    <P>
    <B>This section does not violate a defendant's constitutional
    privilege against self-incrimination.</B>The information
    obtained in compulsory mental examinations is admissible only
    on the issue of mental condition and insanity raised by
    defendants themselves. People v. Bondurant, 2012 COA 50, 296
    P.3d 200.</P>
    <P>
    <B>This section does not violate a defendant's fundamental
    right to present a defense or the right to effective assistance
    of counsel.</B>A defendant can present a defense if he or she
    complies with the statute. People v. Bondurant, 2012 COA 50,
    296 P.3d 200.</P>
    <P>
    <B>The evidentiary prerequisites of this section do not apply
    to the Colorado Children's Code and specifically to delinquency
    proceedings.</B>Because the Colorado Code of Criminal Procedure
    expressly provides that it does not apply to proceedings under
    the Children's Code except as specifically set forth in the
    Criminal Procedure Code itself, and because no such provision
    exists in the Criminal Procedure Code, this section does not
    apply to proceedings under the Children's Code. In re People in
    Interest of A.A., 2013 CO 65, 312 P.3d 1170.</P>
    <P>
    <B>Separate trials designed as safeguard against
    prejudice.</B>On a separate trial of a plea of not guilty by
    reason of insanity in a murder prosecution, a much wider area
    of defendant's conduct may be the subject of inquiry than would
    be permissible in trial of a plea of not guilty; separate
    trials of such issues are provided to safeguard against
    prejudice likely to arise by reason of wide variety of evidence
    competent on issue of insanity but which would not be
    admissible on trial of a not guilty plea. Trujillo v. People,
    150 Colo. 235, 372 P.2d 86 (1962).</P>
    <P>
    <B>Recognition of the constitutional rights of the defendant
    relative to self-incrimination appears in subsection
    (1).</B>Lewis v. Thulemeyer, 189 Colo. 139, 538 P.2d 441
    (1975).</P>
    <P>The general assembly, in providing for the admission in
    evidence of defendant's statements to the psychiatrist where
    sanity is the issue, but barring them on the guilt issue, does
    not violate the defendant's rights against self-incrimination.
    Lewis v. Thulemeyer, 189 Colo. 139, 538 P.2d 441 (1975).</P>
    <P>When the sanity issue is a separate proceeding, as it is in
    Colorado, before a jury that cannot consider the issue of guilt
    in the event the defendant is found sane and where the
    admissions cannot be used to establish guilt, there is no
    self-incrimination within the contemplation of the
    constitutional provisions. Lewis v. Thulemeyer, 189 Colo. 139,
    538 P.2d 441 (1975).</P>
    <P>In a sanity trial the admission of statements made by the
    defendant does not violate his right against self-incrimination
    because the issue of defendant's guilt is not decided. People
    v. Osborn, 42 Colo. App. 376, 599 P.2d 937 (1979).</P>
    <P>
    <B>Subsection (1.5)(a) does not violate the privilege against
    self-incrimination.</B>The only permissible use of statements
    made during a sanity examination is to determine whether a
    defendant was capable of forming a culpable mental state.
    People v. Herrera, 87 P.3d 240 (Colo. App. 2003).</P>
    <P>
    <B>The court's limiting instruction and surrounding
    instructions regarding the expert's testimony on the issue of
    defendant's sanity adequately protected defendant's privilege
    against self-incrimination.</B>People v. Grenier, 200 P.3d 1062
    (Colo. App. 2008).</P>
    <P>
    <B>This section does not force a defendant to choose between
    the privilege against self-incrimination and the due process
    right to a competency determination.</B>A defendant may remain
    silent during the court-ordered evaluation under this section
    and then be examined by a psychiatrist of his own choice under
    §16-8-108. Therefore, under the statutory scheme, the defendant
    could obtain a competency evaluation and protect his privilege
    against self-incrimination unless and until he relied upon the
    lack of mental capacity to commit the charged crimes. People v.
    Thomas, 962 P.2d 263 (Colo. App. 1997).</P>
    <P>
    <B>This section does not force a defendant to choose between
    his privilege against self-incrimination and his fundamental
    right to present a defense.</B>People v. Roadcap, 78 P.3d 1108
    (Colo. App. 2003).</P>
    <P>Defendant could comply with subsection (3)(b) without
    waiving his privilege against self-incrimination by invoking
    the privilege during the court-ordered examination. People v.
    Roadcap, 78 P.3d 1108 (Colo. App. 2003).</P>
    <P>
    <B>Use in impeaching defendant constitutional.</B>Neither the
    United States constitution nor the Colorado constitution should
    be construed to allow a defendant to take the stand without the
    possibility of his credibility being impeached by his prior
    inconsistent statements. Where the defendant makes statements
    to a psychiatrist upon the advice of his counsel and without
    physical coercion and intimidation, he cannot take the stand
    with his credibility immune from attack on the basis of his
    prior inconsistent statements. People v. Pearson, 190 Colo.
    313, 546 P.2d 1259 (1976).</P>
    <P>
    <B>When cross-examination for impeachment purposes not narrowly
    limited.</B>When a defendant elects to fabricate testimony to
    effectively commit perjury, cross-examination for the purpose
    of impeachment is not narrowly limited. People v. Allen, 193
    Colo. 526, 568 P.2d 56 (1977).</P>
    <P>
    <B>Miranda warnings not required.</B>Even assuming that
    warnings are required, or that the examination under this
    section was a type of custodial interrogation requiring that
    defendant be given the equivalent of Miranda v. Arizona (384
    U.S. 436, 86 S. Ct. 1602, 16 L. Ed. 2d 694 (1966)) warnings
    prior to his examination, such warnings are not required before
    the admission of statements for impeachment purposes. People v.
    Pearson, 190 Colo. 313, 546 P.2d 1259 (1976).</P>
    <P>
    <B>The last sentence of subsection (1) cannot be interpreted as
    only permitting</B>the admission of statements concerning
    defendant's lack of capacity to form a specific intent and as
    not allowing the admission of statements concerning other
    issues of his guilt. People v. Pearson, 190 Colo. 313, 546 P.2d
    1259 (1976).</P>
    <P>
    <B>The reference in subsection (1.5)(a) to issues raised by the
    insanity plea relates to the defendant's "mental condition" and
    is equivalent to the references in subsection (1)(a) to a
    defendant's "capacity to form a culpable mental
    state".</B>People v. Herrera, 87 P.3d 240 (Colo. App.
    2003).</P>
    <P>
    <B>Subsection (2) allows for prosecution to call "other
    experts" to testify as to their observations, conversations,
    and opinions regarding a defendant's mental
    condition.</B>Prosecution presented sufficient evidence that
    defendant's behavior was not driven by insanity but by drugs
    and antisocial behavior. People v. Porter, 2013 COA 130, 353
    P.3d 852, rev'd on other grounds, 2015 CO 34, 348 P.3d 922.</P>
    <P>
    <B>Evidence from examination limited to rebuttal in trial of
    guilt.</B>This section provides that any statements made by the
    defendant to examining psychiatrists cannot be used as evidence
    against him in a trial on the issue of guilt of the crime
    charged. However, it is also provided that such evidence may be
    received on the trial of the issued guilt of a murder charge to
    rebut evidence of insanity offered by the defendant to reduce
    the degree of murder. French v. District Court, 153 Colo. 10,
    384 P.2d 268 (1963).</P>
    <P>This section definitely prohibits the presentation of the
    evidence obtained by experts during the period of observation,
    until evidence has been brought forward by defendant placing in
    issue, by testimony, the question of mental capacity. The entry
    of a plea of not guilty by reason of insanity does not destroy
    the presumption of sanity with which all persons are clothed.
    Under this section the evidence obtained during the period of
    observation should not have been received upon the direct case
    of the people on the trial of the issue of guilt and the cause
    is remanded for a new trial upon all issues raised by the plea.
    Leick v. People, 131 Colo. 353, 281 P.2d 806 (1955).</P>
    <P>
    <B>The limitation in this section on the admission of evidence
    applies only to the guilt phase of a trial</B>and does not
    speak to the penalty phase or a postconviction proceeding.
    Dunlap v. People, 173 P.3d 1054 (Colo. 2007), cert. denied, 552
    U.S. 1105, 128 S. Ct. 882, 169 L. Ed. 2d 740 (2008).</P>
    <P>
    <B>Nothing in this section prohibits</B>the prosecution from
    calling the examining psychiatrist to give an opinion based on
    information derived from other sources, provided that such
    evidence was not acquired directly or indirectly for the first
    time from a communication made during the course of a
    court-ordered examination. People v. Saiz, 923 P.2d 197 (Colo.
    App. 1995).</P>
    <P>
    <B>The meaning of "relevant" under subsection (3)(a) is
    plain.</B>Evidence that is "relevant to the issue of insanity"
    is evidence that tends to prove or disprove the issue of
    insanity — that is, evidence that is probative of what is
    defined as insanity. The probative effect of the mental
    condition evidence is what governs, not the purpose for which
    it is offered. People v. Moore, 2021 CO 26, 485 P.3d 1088.</P>
    <P>
    <B>Prosecution's antisocial personality disorder evidence
    properly admitted as relevant evidence.</B>Prosecution's
    rebuttal of a defendant's insanity defense is not limited
    solely to presenting evidence that directly disproves the
    disorder claimed by defendant. Rather, the prosecution may
    present alternative explanations of a defendant's behavior.
    People v. Gonzales-Quevedo, 203 P.3d 609 (Colo. App. 2008).</P>
    <P>
    <B>Use of defendant's statements to hospital employee while
    confined for sanity examination to rebut defendant's
    self-defense theory</B>did not constitute reversible error as
    defendant failed to properly object to hospital employee's
    testimony at trial and fact that testimony was given in
    prosecution's case-in-chief rather than as rebuttal testimony
    did not constitute plain error which would require
    consideration of issue not raised at trial. People v. Kruse,
    839 P.2d 1 (Colo. 1992).</P>
    <P>
    <B>Expert testimony concerning the nature of the
    condition</B>of minimal brain dysfunction, and its relation to
    poor impulse control and lack of willpower, is admissible in
    evidence and relevant to the issue of the defendant's sanity.
    People v. Wright, 648 P.2d 665 (Colo. 1982).</P>
    <P>
    <B>Trial court not required to give limiting instruction sua
    sponte.</B>Court is required to give jury limiting instruction
    on use of expert testimony only at the request of either party.
    People v. Grant, 174 P.3d 798 (Colo. App. 2007).</P>
    <P>
    <B>Trial court has discretion to determine order in which
    evidence will be presented at the sanity trial.</B>People v.
    Osborn, 42 Colo. App. 376, 599 P.2d 937 (1979).</P>
    <P>
    <B>Opinion based on information of third persons not testifying
    inadmissible.</B>A physician cannot express an opinion based in
    whole or in part upon information obtained from third persons
    who have not testified to the facts, and the admission of such
    evidence was reversible error. Ingles v. People, 90 Colo. 51, 6
    P.2d 455 (1931).</P>
    <P>An expert witness is not permitted to give an opinion of
    sanity based upon information obtained from third persons who
    have not testified. Garrison v. People, 158 Colo. 348, 408 P.2d
    60 (1965).</P>
    <P>
    <B>Exception if opinion not based on such information.</B>A
    doctor is not disqualified to express his opinion concerning
    the sanity of a defendant merely because he had some
    information from a source outside his own examination if his
    opinion was not in any manner based on that information.
    Garrison v. People, 158 Colo. 348, 408 P.2d 60 (1965).</P>
    <P>
    <B>Doctor-patient privilege was not violated by court-appointed
    psychiatrist's testimony</B>where the prosecution called him as
    a witness to rebut evidence introduced by defendant which
    tended to show that he was incapable of forming a specific
    intent. People v. Scheidt, 182 Colo. 374, 513 P.2d 446
    (1973).</P>
    <P>
    <B>Admissions to privately retained psychiatrist
    privileged.</B>The prosecution may not call, as a witness in
    its case-in-chief, a psychiatrist privately retained by the
    defendant in connection with an insanity plea and elicit from
    the psychiatrist incriminating admissions made by the defendant
    during a sanity examination. People v. Rosenthal, 617 P.2d 551
    (Colo. 1980).</P>
    <P>
    <B>Prosecutor entitled to physician's information.</B>Where the
    confessions and admissions of the defendant have been weighed
    by the examining physician in evaluating the defendant's
    sanity, fairness requires that the prosecutor have the same
    information as the defense attorney. Lewis v. Thulemeyer, 189
    Colo. 139, 538 P.2d 441 (1975).</P>
    <P>Section only requires a limiting instruction "at the request
    of either party". People v. Freeman, 47 P.3d 700 (Colo. App.
    2001).</P>
    <P>
    <B>Subsection (3)(b) is not limited to evidence of a
    defendant's condition during the offense and it contains no
    exception for evidence of a post-incident condition.</B>Trial
    court properly ruled that expert testimony related to
    defendant's mental condition and that defendant would have to
    comply with the provisions of subsection (3)(b) if he wished to
    have the experts testify. People v. Roadcap, 78 P.3d 1108
    (Colo. App. 2003).</P>
    <P>
    <B>This section does not preclude a defendant from calling
    expert witnesses,</B>it merely requires defendant to comply
    with subsection (3)(b) if he chooses to pursue this line of

    <B>A defendant charged with a specific intent crime cannot

    <P>The error does not require reversal because: the statements

    defendant's guilt; and the prosecution presented substantial
    evidence that the defendant knew his actions were wrong. People

    by his initial claims of insanity. Court did not err in
    allowing prosecution to call the experts to testify in

  <M>If the defendant wishes to be examined by a psychiatrist,
  psychologist, or other expert of his own choice in connection
  with any proceeding under this article, the court, upon timely
  motion, shall order that the examiner chosen by the defendant be
  given reasonable opportunity to conduct the examination. An
  interview conducted pursuant to a court order under this section
  must be video and audio recorded and preserved. The court shall
  advise the defendant that any examination with a psychiatrist or
  forensic psychologist may be audio and video recorded. A copy of
  the recording must be provided to the prosecution with the
  examination report. Any jail or other facility where the court
  orders the examination to take place must permit the recording to
  occur and must provide the space and equipment necessary for such
  recording, if available. If space and equipment are not
  available, the sheriff or facility director shall attempt to
  coordinate a location and the availability of equipment with the
  court, which may consult with the district attorney and defense
  counsel for an agreed upon location. If no agreement is reached,
  and upon the request of either the defense counsel or district
  attorney, the court shall order the location of the examination,
  which may include the Colorado mental health institute at
  Pueblo.</M>
  <P N="(1)(b)">(b)
  <M>Prior to or during any examination required by this section,
  the psychiatrist or forensic psychologist shall assess whether
  the recording of the examination is likely to cause or is causing
  mental or physical harm to the defendant or others. If such a
  determination is made and documented contemporaneously in
  writing, the psychiatrist or forensic psychologist shall not
  record the examination or shall cease recording the examination,
  and the psychiatrist or forensic psychologist shall advise the
  court and the parties of this determination and the reasons
  therefore in a written report to the court. If only a partial
  recording is made, the psychiatrist or forensic psychologist
  shall provide the partial recording to the court and the parties,
  and the partial recording may be used by any psychiatrist or
  forensic psychologist in forming an opinion, submitting a report,
  or testifying on the issue of the defendant's mental
  health.</M></P>

    condition. People v. Giles, 192 Colo. 240, 557 P.2d 408
    (1976).</P>
    <P>
    <B>The foundation to be laid under this section must indicate
    that the conclusions of the witness bear directly upon the
    issue of sanity</B>and not merely conclusions of fact as to
    conduct. People v. Medina, 185 Colo. 101, 521 P.2d 1257
    (1974).</P>
    <P>
    <B>Requirements which must be met before a lay witness can
    express his opinion as to the sanity of another are:</B>(1) It
    must be shown that the lay witness had an adequate means of
    becoming acquainted with the person whose sanity is in issue;
    and (2) the contacts must be proximate in time to the alleged
    offense. People v. Medina, 185 Colo. 101, 521 P.2d 1257
    (1974).</P>
    <P>Before opinion evidence from a nonexpert regarding the
    sanity of another can be admissible, the specific facts upon
    which the opinion is based must be first stated by the witness,
    and his testimony must also show a close or intimate
    relationship with the party alleged to be insane. People v.
    Medina, 185 Colo. 101, 521 P.2d 1257 (1974).</P>
    <P>Before a lay witness is permitted to state an opinion
    regarding the sanity or insanity or mental competence or
    incompetence of a person whose mental condition is at issue,
    the witness must have had ample opportunity to observe the
    speech, manner, habits, or conduct of the person. People v.
    Medina, 185 Colo. 101, 521 P.2d 1257 (1974).</P>
    <P>One who in the opinion of a trial court shows adequate means
    of becoming acquainted with a person whose mental condition is
    in issue, after detailing the facts and circumstances
    concerning his acquaintance and the acts and conversations upon
    which his conclusion is based, may give his opinion on the
    question of sanity. Leick v. People, 136 Colo. 535, 322 P.2d

    (1967).</P>
    <P>The opinion of a nonexpert is admissible only when it is
    made to appear that his acquaintance with a defendant, whose
    sanity is in issue, had the requisite nearness in time after
    the act charged, to persuade the court, in the exercise of a
    sound discretion, to receive it. Leick v. People, 136 Colo.

    <P>The necessary predicate for lay opinion evidence is a
    showing of adequate means to have become acquainted with the
    person whose mental condition is at issue. People v. Giles, 192
    Colo. 240, 557 P.2d 408 (1976).</P>
    <P>A lay witness may give an opinion relative to the
    defendant's sanity if the witness details the facts which
    demonstrate his acquaintance with the defendant, and if those
    facts demonstrate that the acquaintance is close and that
    contacts were maintained at a point proximate in time to the
    alleged offense. People v. Osborn, 42 Colo. App. 376, 599 P.2d
    937 (1979).</P>
    <P>
    <B>Discretion of trial judge.</B>Trial judges have very broad
    discretion in determining whether or not any proffered witness
    is qualified to give opinion testimony. People v. Giles, 192
    Colo. 240, 557 P.2d 408 (1976).</P>
    <P>
    <B>The testimony of a corrections officer who observed
    defendant during defendant's pre-trial incarceration</B>had
    proper foundation. The record indicates that the witness
    testified concerning the witness's observations of defendant's
    behavior, not concerning the witness's opinion of defendant's
    mental condition. This testimony is specifically permitted by
    this section. People v. Henderson, 794 P.2d 1050 (Colo. App.
    1990), rev'd on other grounds, 810 P.2d 1058 (Colo. 1991).</P>
    <P>
    <B>When discretion abused.</B>Where foundation testimony fails
    to conform and where the proper guidelines are not adhered to
    in judging these requirements, it must be held that the trial
    court abused its discretion in permitting the admission of
    nonexpert opinion testimony. People v. Medina, 185 Colo. 101,
    521 P.2d 1257 (1974).</P>
    <P>
    <B>Court abused its discretion in admitting some lay opinions
    from mental health providers who had not been properly noticed
    as experts by the prosecution.</B>Some of the opinions were
    expert opinions improperly admitted under the guise of lay
    opinion testimony. The improper testimony related to symptoms
    of specific mental illness and opinions about whether defendant
    suffered from mental illness. The evidence relied upon the
    witness's specialized knowledge and training and, therefore,
    went beyond the bounds of lay opinion. The error in this case
    was harmless since there was ample evidence in addition to the
    improperly admitted opinions. Dunlap v. People, 173 P.3d 1054

  <N></N>(a)
  <N></N>(I)
  <M>Upon an initial commitment following a finding of not guilty
  by reason of insanity pursuant to section 16-8-105.5 (4)(b), or
  upon delaying final entry of the finding of not guilty by reason
  of insanity pursuant to section 16-8.5-105.5 (4)(a), the court
  shall schedule an initial release hearing no later than one
  hundred twenty days after the initial commitment. The court shall
  order the department of human services to complete a release
  examination no later than thirty days prior to the initial
  release hearing. The defendant may request an additional release
  examination by a medical expert in mental health disorders of the
  defendant's choosing pursuant to section 16-8-108. The court may
  continue the hearing beyond one hundred and twenty days upon a
  finding of good cause or if necessary to conduct a second
  evaluation of the defendant.</M>
  <P N="(1)(a)(II)">(II)
  <M>The court shall conduct the initial release hearing. At the
  initial release hearing, if any evidence is introduced that shows
  the defendant is ineligible for conditional release, the
  defendant has the burden of proving by a preponderance of the
  evidence that the defendant meets the applicable test for
  conditional release pursuant to section 16-8-120. If the court
  finds the defendant eligible for conditional release, the court
  may impose such terms and conditions as the court determines are
  in the best interest of the defendant and the community. If the
  court finds the defendant ineligible for conditional release, the
  court shall commit or continue the previous commitment of the
  defendant to the physical custody of the department of human
  services.</M></P>
  <P N="(1)(a)(III)">(III)
  <M>This subsection (1)(a) applies to individuals found not guilty
  by reason of insanity on or after September 1, 2022.</M></P>
  <P N="(1)(b)">(b)
  <M>Following the initial release hearing pursuant to subsection
  (1)(a) of this section, the court may order a release hearing at
  any time on its own motion, on motion of the prosecuting
  attorney, or on motion of the defendant. The court shall order a
  release hearing upon receipt of the report of the chief officer
  of the institution in which the defendant is committed that the
  defendant no longer requires hospitalization, as provided in
  section 16-8-116. Except for the initial release hearing, unless
  the court for good cause shown permits, the defendant is not
  entitled to a hearing within one year subsequent to a previous
  hearing.</M></P>
  <P N="(1)(c)">(c)
  <M>Beginning September 1, 2022, the chief officer of the
  institution in which the defendant is committed shall annually
  submit a release examination report to the court certifying
  whether the defendant continues to meet the criteria for ongoing
  inpatient hospitalization or meets the applicable test for
  release pursuant to section 16-8-120. The report must be
  submitted each year by the date on which the defendant was
  initially committed for inpatient hospitalization unless another
  release examination is ordered within the twelve months preceding
  such date. The release examination report must include the
  information required for a release examination pursuant to
  subsection (2.5) of this section. The institution shall provide a
  copy of the report to the defendant, the prosecuting attorney,
  and any other attorney of record. Upon receipt and after review
  of the report, the court may order a release hearing on its own
  motion, on motion of the prosecuting attorney, or on motion of
  the defendant.</M></P>

  hearing for release of the perpetrator held pursuant to
  subsection (1) of this section, if such victim or family member

  to any hearing for release of the perpetrator held pursuant to

  <M>The court shall order a release examination of the defendant
  when a current one has not already been furnished or when either
  the prosecution or defense moves for an examination of the
  defendant at a different institution or by different experts. The
  court may order any additional or supplemental examination,
  investigation, or study that it deems necessary to a proper
  consideration and determination of the question of eligibility
  for release. The court shall set the matter for release hearing
  after it has received all of the reports that it has ordered
  under this section. When none of said reports indicates that the
  defendant is eligible for release, the defendant's request for
  release hearing shall be denied by the court if the defendant is
  unable to show by way of an offer of proof any evidence by a
  medical expert in mental disorders that would indicate that the
  defendant is eligible for release. For the purposes of this
  subsection (2), "medical expert in mental disorders" means a
  physician licensed under the provisions of article 240 of title
  12, a psychologist licensed under the provisions of article 245
  of title 12, a psychiatric technician licensed under the
  provisions of article 295 of title 12, a registered professional
  nurse as defined in section 12-255-104 (11), who by reason of
  postgraduate education and additional nursing preparation has
  gained knowledge, judgment, and skill in psychiatric or mental
  health nursing, or a social worker licensed under the provisions
  of part 4 of article 245 of title 12. The release hearing shall
  be to the court or, on demand by the defendant, to a jury of not
  to exceed six persons. At the release hearing, if any evidence of
  insanity is introduced, the defendant has the burden of proving
  restoration of sanity by a preponderance of the evidence; if any
  evidence of ineligibility for release by reason of impaired
  mental condition is introduced, the defendant has the burden of
  proving, by a preponderance of the evidence, that the defendant
  is eligible for release by no longer having an impaired mental
  condition. This subsection (2)(a) shall apply only to offenses
  committed before July 1, 1995.</M></P>

  composed of not more than six persons. At the release hearing, if
  any evidence that the defendant does not meet the release
  criteria is introduced, the defendant has the burden of proving
  by a preponderance of the evidence that the defendant has no
  abnormal mental condition that would be likely to cause the
  defendant to be dangerous either to himself or herself or to
  others or to the community in the reasonably foreseeable future.

  removes the defendant's name from the central registry

  such order only if the court makes written findings of fact that
  the defendant has neither been convicted nor found not guilty by

  <COMMENT-HEAD>ANNOTATION</COMMENT-HEAD>
  <ANNO-NOTE>
    <ANNO-TEXT>
    <B>Annotator's note.</B>Since § 16-8-115 is similar to repealed
    § 39-8-4, C.R.S. 1963, relevant cases construing that provision
    have been included in the annotations to this section. 
    <P>
    <B>This section does not state that the release hearing shall
    be considered a civil proceeding.</B>People v. District Court,
    192 Colo. 225, 557 P.2d 414 (1976).</P>
    <P>Where a proceeding is an inquiry into the mental condition
    of a defendant who has been committed under a plea of not
    guilty by reason of insanity, the proceeding is not an
    adversary proceeding in the usual sense of a case which is
    controlled by the rules of civil procedure. People v. District
    Court, 192 Colo. 225, 557 P.2d 414 (1976).</P>
    <P>
    <B>Rather, it is a special statutory proceeding.</B>In view of
    the detailed procedure prescribed by this section, the release
    proceedings are special statutory proceedings governed by
    C.R.C.P. 81(a), People v. District Court, 192 Colo. 225, 557
    P.2d 414 (1976).</P>
    <P>Historically, the supreme court has considered mental health
    proceedings to be special statutory proceedings. People v.
    District Court, 192 Colo. 225, 557 P.2d 414 (1976).</P>
    <P>
    <B>The provisions of paragraphs (a), (b), and (c) of subsection
    (3) indicate legislative intent</B>to vest the committing court
    with continuing subject matter jurisdiction to determine
    questions relating to the treatment needs of a committed
    defendant. People v. Gilliland, 769 P.2d 477 (Colo. 1989).</P>
    <P>
    <B>Committing court has subject matter jurisdiction to hear and
    determine issues relating to the care and treatment of a
    committed defendant.</B>Court that did not commit defendant was
    without habeas corpus jurisdiction to hear treatment issues.
    Garcia v. Carmel, 873 P.2d 1317 (Colo. 1994).</P>
    <P>But no other circumstances are set forth in the statutes
    relating to the committing court's jurisdiction after the order
    of commitment is entered, and thus there is no jurisdiction
    over issues involving the return of seized property. People v.
    Galves, 955 P.2d 582 (Colo. App. 1997).</P>
    <P>
    <B>Probation, recommitment, and transfer are discretionary acts
    clothed with governmental immunity.</B>Where the trial judge
    had continuing jurisdiction under Colorado law both over
    appellant upon his commitment to a state hospital following
    acquittal on grounds of insanity and his transfer to the state
    penitentiary and over the subject matter involved, the doctrine
    of judicial immunity is applicable to the judge against
    allegations of violations of the civil rights act. The
    supervision of the state hospital and the staff psychiatrist
    were also clothed with governmental immunity because the
    revocation of probation, recommitment, and transfer were
    discretionary in nature. Franklin v. Meredith, 386 F.2d 958
    (10th Cir. 1967).</P>
    <P>
    <B>Implied authority to order recommitment.</B>The statutory
    authority to issue a conditional release order necessarily and
    implicitly includes the authority to enforce that order by
    recommitment. Campbell v. District Court, 195 Colo. 304, 577
    P.2d 1096 (1978).</P>
    <P>
    <B>Automatic commitment not denial of due process.</B>A
    defendant acquitted by reason of insanity is not denied due
    process of law by an immediate and automatic commitment to a
    psychiatric facility, so long as there are available to him
    procedures similar to those in this section. People v. Chavez,
    629 P.2d 1040 (Colo. 1981).</P>
    <P>
    <B>Nor is six-month initial commitment period.</B>Given the
    uncertainties and variables of psychiatric diagnosis and
    prognosis, the legislative choice of a six-month period of
    initial commitment does not violate due process, for in the
    absence of a showing that the time fixed is unreasonable in
    length and unrelated to purpose a court must defer to the
    general assembly's decision. People v. Chavez, 629 P.2d 1040
    (Colo. 1981); Glatz v. Kort, 650 F. Supp. 191 (D. Colo. 1984),
    aff'd, 807 F.2d 1514 (10th Cir. 1986).</P>
    <P>
    <B>Defendant's liberty interest not violated by requirement in
    subsection (4)(a) that he register as a sex offender as a
    condition of his conditional release</B>since the requirement
    was in place prior to his conditional release. People v.
    Durapau, 12 COA 67, 280 P.3d 42.</P>
    <P>
    <B>Since sex offender registration is not
    punitive,</B>requiring an offender who pled not guilty by
    reason of insanity to register as a sex offender upon his or
    her conditional release does not violate the principles of ex
    post facto. People v. Durapau, 12 COA 67, 280 P.3d 42.</P>
    <P>
    <B>Release conditioned by criminal probation denies due
    process.</B>A judgment which places one adjudged not guilty by
    reason of insanity on criminal probation or, on his refusal to
    accept such terms, remands him to indefinite custody violates
    his fourteenth amendment rights under the United States
    constitution. Such a commitment is an invalid deprivation of
    liberty without due process. Scheidt v. Meredith, 307 F. Supp.
    63 (D. Colo. 1970).</P>
    <P>
    <B>As such conditions may not be imposed on one not convicted
    of crime.</B>Criminal probation is designed for the guilty and
    not for those who are not guilty. An essential requirement is
    an adjudication of guilt, and punitive aspects are clearly
    involved. The conditions imposed upon a person who has been
    granted probationary release under this section are, as a
    matter of practice, the same conditions imposed upon a
    convicted criminal who has been placed on probation. The
    imposition of such conditions on one who has not been convicted
    of a crime is unconstitutional. Scheidt v. Meredith, 307 F.
    Supp. 63 (D. Colo. 1970).</P>
    <P>
    <B>Unrelated criminal probationary conditions
    unconstitutional.</B>The imposition of criminal probationary
    conditions which are not related to the individual seeking
    release are unconstitutional. Campbell v. District Court, 195
    Colo. 304, 577 P.2d 1096 (1978).</P>
    <P>
    <B>Conditional release of one restored to sanity may not be
    conditioned on terms having no relation to his status</B>and
    which were nonresponsive or irrelevant to the judgment of not
    guilty by reason of insanity. Scheidt v. Meredith, 307 F. Supp.
    63 (D. Colo. 1970).</P>
    <P>
    <B>Court may impose nonpunitive terms such as out-patient
    care.</B>The interests of the community and the individual are
    relevant to the granting of a conditional release. It would be
    clearly proper to require that petitioner accept psychiatric
    out-patient care or supervision, but, terms which were designed
    to regulate the activities of convicted criminals, and which
    are punitive in nature, cannot be imposed. Scheidt v. Meredith,
    307 F. Supp. 63 (D. Colo. 1970).</P>
    <P>
    <B>However, there is no per se prohibition against admission of
    evidence concerning specific conditions of release.</B>Rather,
    admissibility of evidence is to be determined within framework
    of rules of relevance in rules of evidence. Vialpando v.
    People, 727 P.2d 1090 (Colo. 1986).</P>
    <P>
    <B>Under subsection (3),</B>a defendant who is conditionally
    released remains under the supervision of the department of
    institutions until the committing court enters a final order of
    unconditional release. People v. McCoy, 821 P.2d 873 (Colo.
    App. 1991).</P>
    <P>
    <B>Writ of habeas corpus is a proper remedy</B>for persons
    committed to a state hospital after a plea of not guilty by
    reason of insanity to challenge a lack of treatment and to
    obtain a remedy addressing appropriate treatment short of
    immediate release. Marshall v. Kort, 690 P.2d 219 (Colo.
    1984).</P>
    <P>
    <B>Court may terminate release to order
    examination.</B>Inasmuch as defendant had been away from the
    hospital on a probationary release, the hospital authorities
    would almost have to reexamine him in order to determine his
    present mental condition and the trial court could terminate
    probationary release and return him to the hospital for the
    period of time necessary for reexamination. Bartosik v. People,
    163 Colo. 267, 430 P.2d 83 (1967).</P>
    <P>
    <B>No broad right of discovery.</B>Based on this section and §§
    16-8-116 and 16-8-117 and on the special nonadversary nature of
    a release inquiry, the participants in release proceedings do
    not have the broad right of discovery as provided in the rules
    of civil procedure. People v. District Court, 192 Colo. 225,
    557 P.2d 414 (1976).</P>
    <P>Under C.R.C.P. 81(a), the procedure in release hearings
    under this section is so inconsistent and in conflict with the
    rules of civil procedure as to make civil discovery rules
    inapplicable to release hearings. People v. District Court, 192
    Colo. 225, 557 P.2d 414 (1976).</P>
    <P>
    <B>Discretion of trial court as to procedures.</B>The
    procedures set out in this section and § 16-8-117 are addressed
    to the discretion of the trial court and permit all
    participants to prepare adequately for the hearing. People v.
    District Court, 192 Colo. 225, 557 P.2d 414 (1976).</P>
    <P>Upon a proper showing, the trial court may use or authorize
    the use of suitable discovery procedures reasonably fashioned
    to elicit facts necessary to help the court dispose of the
    matter as law and justice may require. People v. District
    Court, 192 Colo. 225, 557 P.2d 414 (1976).</P>
    <P>
    <B>The jury's function ends with its determination whether or
    not the defendant is eligible for release.</B>People v. Giles,
    192 Colo. 240, 557 P.2d 408 (1976); People v. Vialpando, 695
    P.2d 1192 (Colo. App. 1984), rev'd on other grounds, 727 P.2d
    1090 (Colo. 1986).</P>
    <P>
    <B>The decision whether to impose conditions on release is
    solely for the court.</B>People v. Giles, 192 Colo. 240, 557
    P.2d 408 (1976); People v. Vialpando, 695 P.2d 1192 (Colo. App.
    1984), rev'd on other grounds, 727 P.2d 1090 (Colo. 1986).</P>
    <P>Where conditional release is appropriate, the terms and
    conditions must be tailor-made by the court to fit the
    individual case. It is the court, not the jury, which has the
    necessary experience and knowledge of available alternatives to
    perform this function. People v. Giles, 192 Colo. 240, 557 P.2d
    408 (1976).</P>
    <P>
    <B>Burden of proof shifts to the defendant in a release
    hearing</B>once any evidence is introduced that the defendant
    is not eligible for release. People v. Hilton, 902 P.2d 883
    (Colo. App. 1995).</P>
    <P>
    <B>Trial court acted properly in shifting burden of proving
    eligibility for release to the defendant</B>where state
    introduced evidence that defendant was not eligible for release
    because he had an abnormal mental condition. People v. Hilton,
    902 P.2d 883 (Colo. App. 1995).</P>
    <P>
    <B>Burden of proof.</B>Where the superintendent of the state
    hospital recommended the defendant's release from commitment
    and a release hearing was held, but a jury denied the defendant
    his release, and he appealed, the appellate court reversed and
    remanded to the trial court with directions to hold another
    hearing. The trial court asked the superintendent for an
    updated report and this time the superintendent recommended
    that the defendant remain committed. It was perfectly proper
    for the trial court to order a reexamination of the defendant
    in order to bring the evidence up to date. As a result the
    superintendent rendered a contrary opinion, which the defendant
    contested. Under the plain language of subsection (2) the
    contestant defendant then had the burden of proof. People v.
    District Court, 189 Colo. 151, 538 P.2d 469 (1975).</P>
    <P>
    <B>Burden of proof on one seeking release.</B>One who is
    contesting the recommendation of the custodial institution has
    the burden of proving by a preponderance of the evidence that
    he is not likely to be dangerous. People v. Howell, 196 Colo.
    408, 586 P.2d 27 (1978).</P>
    <P>
    <B>It is not unconstitutional to require defendant to bear
    burden of proof</B>that he will not be dangerous in the
    reasonably foreseeable future in a proceeding under this
    section. People v. Logan, 196 Colo. 573, 588 P.2d 870
    (1979).</P>
    <P>
    <B>Allocation of burden of proof to defendant
    permissible.</B>In a case of contested eligibility for release
    the statutory allocation of the burden of proof is permissible
    because: (1) There will have been a judicial determination of
    probable cause to believe that the defendant committed the acts
    charged against him as a crime; (2) there will have been an
    adjudication that at the time of the commission of the offense
    the defendant was legally insane; and (3) the chief officer of
    the institution to which the defendant has been committed will
    have found him ineligible for release by reason of a mental
    disease or defect likely to cause him to be dangerous to
    himself, to others, or to the community, in the reasonably
    foreseeable future. People v. Chavez, 629 P.2d 1040 (Colo.
    1981).</P>
    <P>
    <B>Jury's entitlement to hear all competent evidence relevant
    to the ultimate issue</B>in the case may include evidence that
    bears on the likelihood of whether the defendant's release
    would pose a danger to himself, to others, or to the community
    in the reasonably foreseeable future. Vialpando v. People, 727
    P.2d 1090 (Colo. 1986).</P>
    <P>
    <B>Phrase "any other evidence"</B>in subsection (2) does not
    mean expert testimony only and may include lay testimony that
    would indicate that defendant was eligible for release. People

    <B>The term "dangerousness" does not violate due process</B>due

    <P>
    <B>The test for release under this section is a fair and

    <P>
    <B>And need not be same test applied to determine insanity at
    time of offense.</B>A state is not required to apply the same
    standard to govern release of one previously found not guilty
    by reason of insanity as it applied in determining that he was
    insane at the time of offense. People v. Giles, 192 Colo. 240,

    <P>Defendant was not denied due process by failure to apply as
    the standard for release the same test applied to determine

    dangerousness. People v. Parrish, 879 P.2d 453 (Colo. App.

    <P>
    <B>The term "abnormal mental condition" according to its plain
    meaning includes a severe antisocial personality
    disorder,</B>however such a disorder is manifested. People v.

    <P>
    <B>Insanity test under this section and § 16-8-101
    different.</B>The general assembly has chosen by enactment of §
    16-8-101 and this section to distinguish between the test in a
    criminal case for a verdict of not guilty by reason of insanity
    and the test for release from a mental institution once it is
    suggested that commitment might safely be terminated. People v.
    Lyles, 186 Colo. 302, 526 P.2d 1332 (1974).</P>
    <P>
    <B>The purpose of the test for release</B>under this section is
    to determine whether a person who previously claimed he was
    criminally insane, and therefore not accountable for actions
    which otherwise would be crimes, should now be set free. People
    v. Giles, 192 Colo. 240, 557 P.2d 408 (1976).</P>
    <P>
    <B>Stringent standards for release related to public
    safety.</B>The more stringent standards for release applicable
    to the criminally committed defendant reflect the increased
    risk to the public associated with the release decision and, as
    in the case of automatic commitment, they are reasonably
    related to the state's interest in public safety. People v.
    Chavez, 629 P.2d 1040 (Colo. 1981).</P>
    <P>
    <B>For purposes of determining eligibility for release,</B>the
    terms "mental disease or defect", as used in § 16-8-116, and
    "abnormal mental condition", as used in this section, are
    equivalent. People v. Parrish, 879 P.2d 453 (Colo. App. 1994);
    Parrish v. State of Colo., 78 F.3d 1473 (10th Cir. 1996).</P>
    <P>
    <B>Potential dangerousness of a defendant is an essential
    element in determining his eligibility for release.</B>Evidence
    regarding conditions of release recommended to reduce that
    dangerousness is, therefore, directly related to a fact of
    consequence to the determination of the action. Vialpando v.
    People, 727 P.2d 1090 (Colo. 1986).</P>
    <P>
    <B>Determination of dangerousness function of jury.</B>Although
    a court should take full advantage of the expert psychiatric
    and psychological testimony offered by parties as to the
    element of danger, the ultimate determination of whether one
    has an abnormal mental condition likely to cause him to be
    dangerous in the reasonably foreseeable future is for the jury.
    People v. Howell, 196 Colo. 408, 586 P.2d 27 (1978).</P>
    <P>
    <B>Probable future conduct may be considered in determination
    of dangerousness.</B>The fact that the determination of
    dangerousness involves a prediction of the appellant's future
    conduct rather than mere characterization of his past conduct
    does not violate due process, since the required finding is the
    likelihood of dangerous conduct in terms of probability, not
    mere possibility. People v. Howell, 196 Colo. 408, 586 P.2d 27
    (1978).</P>
    <P>
    <B>Application of statutory test within expertise of qualified
    expert clinical psychologist.</B>Where witness was qualified by
    the court as an expert clinical psychologist, the application
    of the statutory test for release specified in this section is
    within his expertise, and, with the proper foundation and
    questions, he may give his professional opinion as to whether a
    patient suffers from "an abnormal mental condition". People v.
    Lyles, 186 Colo. 302, 526 P.2d 1332 (1974).</P>
    <P>
    <B>A defendant is not required to submit the matter of his
    eligibility for release to a second jury trial</B>before he may
    be released. People ex rel. Farina v. District Court, 191 Colo.
    225, 553 P.2d 394 (1976).</P>
    <P>Where defendant was determined eligible for release from the
    hospital in a hearing in one county, the doctrine of collateral
    estoppel applied, and a hearing on the same issue scheduled in
    another county was precluded. People ex rel. Farina v. District
    Court, 191 Colo. 225, 553 P.2d 394 (1976).</P>

    <B>A person confined pursuant to a not guilty by reason of
    insanity plea may not be released under this section so long

    abnormal mental condition rendering such person dangerous and
    such person continues to receive appropriate treatment for that
    abnormality. People v. Jones, 935 P.2d 28 (Colo. App.

  <M>Mental incompetency to proceed - how and when
  raised.</M></CATCH-LINE>(1)
  <M>While a defendant is incompetent to proceed, the defendant
  shall not be tried or sentenced, nor shall the court consider or
  decide pretrial matters that are not susceptible of fair
  determination without the personal participation of the
  defendant. However, a determination that a defendant is
  incompetent to proceed shall not preclude the furtherance of the
  proceedings by the court to consider and decide matters,
  including a preliminary hearing and motions, that are susceptible
  of fair determination prior to trial and without the personal
  participation of the defendant. Those proceedings may be later
  reopened if, in the discretion of the court, substantial new
  evidence is discovered after and as a result of the restoration
  to competency of the defendant.</M>
  <P N="(2)">(2)
  <M>The question of a defendant's competency to proceed must be
  raised in only one of the following manners:</M></P>
  <P N="(2)(a)">(a)
  <M>If the judge has reason to believe that the defendant is
  incompetent to proceed, it is the judge's duty to suspend the
  proceeding and determine the competency or incompetency of the
  defendant pursuant to section 16-8.5-103;</M></P>
  <P N="(2)(b)">(b)
  <M>If either the defense or the prosecution has reason to believe
  that the defendant is incompetent to proceed, either party may
  file a motion in advance of the commencement of the particular
  proceeding. A motion to determine competency shall be in writing
  and contain a certificate of counsel stating that the motion is
  based on a good faith doubt that the defendant is competent to
  proceed. The motion shall set forth the specific facts that have
  formed the basis for the motion. The motion shall be sealed by
  the court. If the motion is made by the prosecution, the
  prosecution shall provide to the defense a copy of the motion. If
  the motion is made by the defense, the defense shall provide to
  the prosecution notice of the filing of the motion at the time of
  filing, and if the defense requests a hearing, the defense shall
  provide the motion to the prosecution at the time the hearing is
  requested. The motion may be filed after the commencement of the
  proceeding if, for good cause shown, the mental disability or
  developmental disability of the defendant was not known or
  apparent before the commencement of the proceeding.</M></P>

    have been included in the annotations to this section.</P>
    <P>
    <B>Common-law rule.</B>It has long been the rule of the common
    law that a person cannot be required to plead to an indictment
    or be tried for a crime while he is so mentally disordered as
    to be incapable of making a rational defense, and he cannot be
    adjudged to punishment or executed while so disordered as to be
    incapable of stating any reasons that may exist why judgment
    should not be pronounced or executed. Hampton v. Tinsley, 240
    F. Supp. 213 (D. Colo. 1965), rev'd on other grounds, 355 F.2d
    470 (10th Cir. 1966).</P>
    <P>The heart of the common-law doctrine has been that a
    suggestion of incompetency after sentence is an appeal to the
    conscience and sound wisdom of the particular tribunal which is
    asked to postpone sentence. Leick v. People, 140 Colo. 564, 345
    P.2d 1054 (1959).</P>
    <P>
    <B>This section is constitutional.</B>Leick v. People, 140
    Colo. 564, 345 P.2d 1054 (1959).</P>
    <P>This section is not unconstitutional as depriving a
    convicted person of due process of law, proceedings to
    determine competency after conviction being purely a matter of
    legislative regulation and subject to such restrictions as the
    general assembly may impose. Leick v. People, 140 Colo. 564,
    345 P.2d 1054 (1959).</P>
    <P>
    <B>This section meets due process requirements of the
    fourteenth amendment.</B>The section involves weighty
    governmental interest, and because of the significant
    consequences to due process that an error in making the
    determination of mental competency would have, the lower
    "reason to believe" standard is an appropriate threshold for
    commencing the determination of mental competency. Cappelli v.
    Demlow, 935 P.2d 57 (Colo. App. 1996).</P>
    <P>
    <B>No fourteenth amendment equal protection clause
    violation</B>merely because of the lower "reason to believe"
    threshold for criminal commitment statute versus a probable
    cause standard of civil commitment statutes. Cappelli v.
    Demlow, 935 P.2d 57 (Colo. App. 1996).</P>

    <B>This section does not implicate the fourth
    amendment.</B>Cappelli v. Demlow, 935 P.2d 57 (Colo. App.
    1996).</P>
    <P>
    <B>Purpose of this section</B>is to ensure against a violation
    of due process that would arise if a defendant who is not
    mentally competent were required to stand trial or participate
    in other critical criminal procedures. Schwader v. District
    Court, 172 Colo. 474, 474 P.2d 607 (1970); Cappelli v. Demlow,
    935 P.2d 57 (Colo. App. 1996).</P>
    <P>
    <B>Subsection (1) of former § 16-8-110 declared
    unconstitutional as violation of due process to the extent that
    it allowed an accused to be tried on the issue of insanity
    notwithstanding a judicial finding that the accused is
    incompetent to proceed.</B>Coolbroth v. District Court, 766
    P.2d 670 (Colo. 1988).</P>
    <P>
    <B>Subsection (2)(b) requires a trial court to consider defense
    counsel's motion raising competency without disclosing that
    motion to the prosecution.</B>People v. Roina, 2019 CO 20, 437
    P.3d 919.</P>
    <P>
    <B>The plain language of the statute provides that the trial
    court may consider the defense's ex parte competency motion
    when the defense raises competency and seeks a preliminary
    finding as to competency.</B>People v. Roina, 2019 CO 20, 437
    P.3d 919.</P>
    <P>Defense counsel's sealed motion raising defendant's
    competency was a request for the court to order an initial
    competency evaluation of the defendant. Subsection (2)(b)
    requires trial courts to consider these motions even though
    they may be characterized as ex parte communications. The trial
    court erred in determining that it could review the defense's
    motion only if it provided a copy to the prosecution. People v.
    Roina, 2019 CO 20, 437 P.3d 919.</P>
    <P>
    <B>The general assembly made clear in § 16-8.5-103 that there
    is a distinction between the preliminary finding as to
    competency and the competency hearing.</B>People v. Roina, 2019
    CO 20, 437 P.3d 919.</P>
    <P>
    <B>Subsection (2)(b) requires the defense to provide the
    prosecution a copy of a sealed motion raising competency only
    when defense counsel requests a competency hearing,</B>not a
    preliminary finding as to competency. People v. Roina, 2019 CO
    20, 437 P.3d 919.</P>
    <P>
    <B>Trial court fulfilled its duty to inquire about defendant's
    mental health and did not abuse its discretion</B>in allowing
    defendant to waive his right to counsel and proceed with trial
    without a mental health evaluation to determine his competency
    to do so. The fact that defendant has had mental health
    counseling or treatment in the past, without more, is not
    sufficient to trigger an inquiry into a defendant's competency
    to stand trial. People v. Woods, 931 P.2d 530 (Colo. App.
    1996).</P>
    <P>
    <B>Court needs not await a specific request from
    defense.</B>People v. Thomas, 962 P.2d 263 (Colo. App.
    1997).</P>
    <P>Trial court acted properly in ordering competency evaluation
    based on a pretrial motion that raised doubts as to defendant's
    competency, then allowing testimony by evaluating doctor to
    rebut defendant's claim of lack of mental capacity. People v.
    Thomas, 962 P.2d 263 (Colo. App. 1997).</P>
    <P>
    <B>Court met the low "reason to believe" standard in ordering
    competency evaluation.</B>Court did not order the evaluation
    solely because the defendant exercised his right to represent
    himself. The court's interactions with defendant supported the
    court's doubts about defendant's competency. Because the court
    did not abuse its discretion in ordering the competency
    evaluation, the period during which the defendant was under
    observation is excluded from the speedy trial calculation.
    People v. Nagi, 2014 COA 12, 396 P.3d 60, aff'd, 2017 CO 12,

    <P>
    <B>An accused may not plead guilty, be tried, or sentenced
    while he is incompetent.</B>Hampton v. Tinsley, 240 F. Supp.
    213 (D. Colo. 1965), rev'd on other grounds, 355 F.2d 470 (10th
    Cir. 1966).</P>
    <P>A proceeding against an insane person in a criminal matter
    is a violation of his rights under the due process clause of
    the fourteenth amendment. Hampton v. Tinsley, 240 F. Supp. 213
    (D. Colo. 1965), rev'd on other grounds, 355 F.2d 470 (10th
    Cir. 1966).</P>
    <P>An incompetent person may not be tried for a crime, nor may
    he be sentenced where his incompetency occurs and continues
    after the return of a verdict, nor may he be executed where
    incompetency occurs and continues after the sentence of death
    has been imposed. Leick v. People, 136 Colo. 535, 322 P.2d 674,
    cert. denied, 357 U.S. 922, 78 S. Ct. 1363, 2 L. Ed. 2d 1366
    (1958).</P>
    <P>This section provides that a person sentenced to death who
    becomes and remains incompetent after judgment but, of
    necessity, before the sentence is carried out, shall not be
    executed until his recovery. Garrison v. People, 151 Colo. 388,
    378 P.2d 401 (1963).</P>
    <P>This statute requires that the person charged shall not be
    tried while his incompetency continues. Schwader v. District
    Court, 172 Colo. 474, 474 P.2d 607 (1970).</P>
    <P>Because of the nature of a preliminary hearing, the right to
    counsel at a preliminary hearing reaches constitutional
    proportions, but the right to counsel is a meaningless right
    unless the accused has the capacity to confer with counsel
    regarding the accusation, the nature of the proceedings, and
    the testimony of the witnesses. Schwader v. District Court, 172
    Colo. 474, 474 P.2d 607 (1970).</P>
    <P>The prohibition against prosecuting an incompetent defendant
    attaches at the commencement of formal criminal proceedings and
    continues throughout the execution and satisfaction of the
    sentence. Jones v. District Court, 617 P.2d 803 (Colo.
    1980).</P>
    <P>
    <B>Although court is permitted to use the same competency
    standard to determine whether defendant is competent to stand
    trial and competent to proceed pro se,</B>it is not required to
    do so under Indiana v. Edwards, 554 U.S. 164, 128 S. Ct. 2379,
    171 L. Ed. 2d 345 (2008). People v. Wilson, 397 P.3d 1090
    (Colo. App. 2011), aff'd, 2015 CO 37, 349 P.3d 257.</P>
    <P>
    <B>Trial of incompetent violates due process.</B>Subjecting an
    accused to trial when he or she is incompetent violates due
    process of law. People v. Matthews, 662 P.2d 1108 (Colo. App.
    1983).</P>
    <P>
    <B>Insane persons are not necessarily incompetent to stand
    trial</B>because of the fact of their insanity. People v.
    Lopez, 640 P.2d 275 (Colo. App. 1982).</P>
    <P>
    <B>Amnesia, in and of itself, does not constitute
    incompetency.</B>The trial court should engage in a
    fact-specific inquiry that encompasses a review of the totality
    of the circumstances of a particular case. Although the review
    may include considerations as to a defendant's memory loss, no
    particular set of factors is determinative. If a defendant's
    amnesia renders him or her unable to understand the proceedings
    against him or her or to assist in his or her own defense, then
    the defendant must be found incompetent. People v. Palmer, 31
    P.3d 863 (Colo. 2001).</P>
    <P>
    <B>An incompetent cannot waive his constitutional rights</B>and
    a trial judge must carefully safeguard such rights should the
    judge have a reasonable doubt as to a criminal defendant's
    competency. People v. Lopez, 640 P.2d 275 (Colo. App.
    1982).</P>
    <P>
    <B>Standards for assessing competency.</B>An accused's
    competency must be assessed with specific reference to the
    nature of the proceeding with which he is confronted and the
    appropriate level of understanding necessary for meaningful
    cooperation with his attorney. Jones v. District Court, 617
    P.2d 803 (Colo. 1980).</P>
    <P>
    <B>The determination of competency of accused to stand trial
    must be made before issues raised by insanity plea are
    tried.</B>Parks v. Denver District Court, 180 Colo. 202, 503
    P.2d 1029 (1972).</P>
    <P>Insanity at the time of the commission of the offense is not
    a mitigating factor that relieves the accused of punishment,
    but is a complete defense to the criminal charge, and therefore
    the determination of sanity at the time of the offense requires
    a full hearing, and the accused must be able to understand and
    assist his counsel in his defense. Parks v. Denver District
    Court, 180 Colo. 202, 503 P.2d 1029 (1972).</P>
    <P>
    <B>Determination prior to preliminary hearing.</B>The right to
    counsel is a meaningless right unless the defendant has the
    capacity to confer with his attorney regarding the pending
    charges and the testimony presented at the preliminary hearing,
    thus, a defendant is entitled to have a determination made as
    to his competency prior to a preliminary hearing. People v.
    Fletcher, 37 Colo. App. 173, 546 P.2d 980 (1975), rev'd on
    other grounds, 193 Colo. 314, 566 P.2d 345 (1977).</P>
    <P>
    <B>But denial may not require reversal.</B>Unless a defendant
    demonstrates that he was prejudiced by his inability to obtain
    a competency hearing prior to the preliminary hearing, the
    denial of such a hearing does not require reversal of a
    subsequent conviction. People v. Fletcher, 37 Colo. App. 173,
    546 P.2d 980 (1975), rev'd on other grounds, 193 Colo. 314, 566
    P.2d 345 (1977).</P>
    <P>
    <B>Trial court's failure to make preliminary finding of
    competency on the record</B>is not necessarily reversible
    error. People v. Green, 658 P.2d 281 (Colo. App. 1982).</P>
    <P>
    <B>Defendant must comply with section.</B>An attempt to aver
    incompetency subsequent to an alleged offense is ineffectual
    when not in compliance with this section. Leick v. People, 136
    Colo. 535, 322 P.2d 674, cert. denied, 357 U.S. 922, 78 S. Ct.
    1363, 2 L. Ed. 2d 1366 (1958).</P>
    <P>This section spells out the procedures to be followed in a
    proceeding to determine if a defendant is incompetent after the
    alleged offense. Garrison v. People, 151 Colo. 388, 378 P.2d
    401 (1963).</P>
    <P>
    <B>Showing necessary to "raise the issue" of a defendant's
    competency after trial has commenced.</B>Where trial court had
    an opportunity to observe defendant during first day of trial
    and noted that defendant understood her competency was being
    addressed and, without prompting, stated she wanted to continue
    the trial, defense counsel's assertion of defendant's condition
    of methadone withdrawal did not create a reason to presume
    mental incompetency. People v. Morino, 743 P.2d 49 (Colo. App.
    1987).</P>
    <P>
    <B>Mere statement at time of sentencing that defendant's
    behavior at the time of the offense was "bizarre"</B>was
    insufficient to trigger the requirement that the court suspend
    the proceedings and make a competency hearing. People v.

    <B>Court correctly ruled that the issue of competency had not

    <P>Because defense counsel raised a "sufficient doubt" about

    <B>Even where competence issue raised by court.</B>That the

    statutory procedures set forth in this section and § 16-8-111,
    which provide those safeguards necessary to insure against the
    prosecution of an incompetent defendant, constitutes error so
    prejudicial as to be characterized as one of constitutional
    deprivation. Retrospective determination of the defendant's
    mental competency during his trial will not cure the error.

    <P>Under the totality of the circumstances, including the
    competency motion filed by defendant's counsel that was bereft
    of specific facts supporting a good-faith doubt regarding
    defendant's competency, the trial court did not abuse its
    discretion in rejecting the motion as inadequate. People v.

    <P>
    <B>When duty to suspend proceeding arises.</B>The duty in

    <B>Determination may be initiated at any time.</B>Where no

  <M>Determination of competency to proceed.</M></CATCH-LINE>(1)
  <N></N>(a)
  <M>Whenever the question of a defendant's competency to proceed
  is raised, by either party or on the court's own motion, the
  court may make a preliminary finding of competency or
  incompetency to proceed, which is a final determination unless a
  party to the case objects within seven days after the court's
  preliminary finding.</M>
  <P N="(1)(b)">(b)
  <M>On or before the date when a court orders that a defendant be
  evaluated for competency, a court liaison for the district hired
  pursuant to part 2 of article 11.9 of this title 16 may be
  assigned to the defendant.</M></P>
  <P N="(2)">(2)
  <M>If either party objects to the court's preliminary finding, or
  if the court determines that it has insufficient information to
  make a preliminary finding, the court shall order that the
  defendant be evaluated for competency by the department and that
  the department prepare a court-ordered report.</M></P>
  <P N="(3)">(3)
  <M>Within seven days after receipt of the court-ordered report,
  either party may request a hearing or a second
  evaluation.</M></P>
  <P N="(4)">(4)
  <M>If a party requests a second evaluation, any pending requests
  for a hearing must be continued until the receipt of the second
  evaluation report. The report of the expert conducting the second
  evaluation must be completed and filed with the court within
  thirty-five days after the court order allowing the second
  evaluation, unless the time period is extended by the court for
  good cause. If a second evaluation is completed and restoration
  is ultimately ordered, then the court shall make the second
  evaluation available to the department. If the second evaluation
  is requested by the court, it must be paid for by the
  court.</M></P>
  <P N="(5)">(5)
  <M>If neither party requests a hearing or a second evaluation
  within the applicable time frame, the court shall enter a final
  determination, based on the information then available to the
  court, whether the defendant is or is not competent to
  proceed.</M></P>
  <P N="(6)">(6)
  <M>If a party makes a timely request for a hearing, the hearing
  shall be held within thirty-five days after the request for a
  hearing or, if applicable, within thirty-five days after the
  filing of the second evaluation report, unless the time is
  extended by the court after a finding of good cause.</M></P>
  <P N="(7)">(7)
  <M>At any hearing held pursuant to this section, the party
  asserting the incompetency of the defendant shall have the burden
  of submitting evidence and the burden of proof by a preponderance
  of the evidence.</M></P>
  <P N="(8)">(8)
  <M>If the question of the defendant's incompetency to proceed is
  raised after a jury is impaneled to try the issues raised by a
  plea of not guilty and the court determines that the defendant is
  incompetent to proceed or orders a court-ordered competency
  evaluation, the court may declare a mistrial. Declaration of a
  mistrial under these circumstances does not constitute jeopardy,
  nor does it prohibit the trial or sentencing of the defendant for
  the same offense after he or she has been found restored to
  competency.</M></P>
  <P N="(9)">(9)
  <M>In all proceedings under this article 8.5, when competency has
  been raised by the parole board pursuant to section 16-8.5-102
  (2)(d), the court shall pay for any evaluation to determine
  competency pursuant to this section, and the evaluation must be
  conducted at the place where the defendant is in
  custody.</M></P></SECTION-TEXT>

    constitutional dimension. People v. Zimmer, 2021 COA 40, 491

    <B>It relates to a reprieve.</B>Postponement of execution
    because of incompetency bears a close affinity not to trial for
    a crime, but rather to reprieves of sentences in general. Leick
    v. People, 140 Colo. 564, 345 P.2d 1054 (1959).</P>

    <B>The ultimate issue is the competency, or lack of it, of a

    <B>The burden is upon a defendant to establish his
    incompetency.</B>Leick v. People, 140 Colo. 564, 345 P.2d 1054
    (1959).</P>
    <P>The burden is upon the petitioner alleging incompetency to
    produce sufficient evidence to overcome the presumption of
    validity and regularity surrounding entry of his plea of
    guilty. Hampton v. Tinsley, 240 F. Supp. 213 (D. Colo. 1965),
    rev'd on other grounds, 355 F.2d 470 (10th Cir. 1966).</P>
    <P>The burden is on defendant to prove incompetency by a
    preponderance of the evidence under pretrial statutory
    procedure, when a defendant raises the issue of incompetency
    after the alleged commission of the crime. Gomez v. District
    Court, 179 Colo. 299, 500 P.2d 134 (1972).</P>
    <P>
    <B>Standards for assessing accused's incompetency.</B>An
    accused's competency must be assessed with specific reference
    to the nature of the proceeding with which he is confronted and
    the appropriate level of understanding necessary for meaningful
    cooperation with his attorney. Jones v. District Court, 617
    P.2d 803 (Colo. 1980).</P>
    <P>
    <B>And must allow defendant time to request hearing.</B>Trial
    court exceeded its jurisdiction when it made a preliminary
    finding of competency and simultaneously ordered the
    petitioner's attorney to present his motions on capital
    punishment issues without affording the petitioner the
    opportunity, within a time designated by the court, to request
    a statutory hearing on a final determination of competency in
    accordance with this section. Jones v. District Court, 617 P.2d
    803 (Colo. 1980).</P>
    <P>A final determination of competency cannot be made by a
    trial court without first affording a defendant the opportunity
    to challenge its preliminary finding. People v. Matthews, 662
    P.2d 1108 (Colo. App. 1983).</P>
    <P>By failing to immediately notify the defendant of
    preliminary finding of competency, and failing to set a time
    within which the defendant can request a hearing to challenge
    its preliminary finding, the trial court exceeded its
    jurisdiction and abused its discretion. People v. Matthews, 662
    P.2d 1108 (Colo. App. 1983); People v. Arkadie, 692 P.2d 1145
    (Colo. App. 1984).</P>
    <P>
    <B>Evidence of defendant rebuts presumption of sanity.</B>When
    evidence of insanity after commission of a crime is produced by
    defendant, the presumption that he was sane disappears, so
    that, if the people are to prevail, they must produce evidence
    of sanity to rebut that of insanity produced by the defendant.
    Gomez v. District Court, 179 Colo. 299, 500 P.2d 134
    (1972).</P>
    <P>
    <B>And it was error not to find incompetency.</B>Where no
    evidence had been introduced by prosecution to dispute that
    offered by petitioner that he was incompetent and incapable of
    conducting his defense in a rational and reasonable manner,
    trial court erred in not directing determination of
    incompetency. Gomez v. District Court, 179 Colo. 299, 500 P.2d
    134 (1972).</P>
    <P>
    <B>Defendant's competence is an issue of fact and the trial
    court's findings will not be disturbed if adequately supported
    by evidence in the record.</B>There was sufficient evidence to
    support the trial court's finding of competence where, although
    defendant had probably experienced a brief delusional episode
    during the trial, defendant had failed to prove by a
    preponderance of the evidence that she suffered from a mental
    disease or defect that rendered her incapable of understanding
    the nature and course of the proceedings or made her incapable
    of participating or assisting in her defense. People v.
    Corichi, 18 P.3d 807 (Colo. App. 2000).</P>
    <P>
    <B>Considerable latitude is allowed by the courts in admitting
    evidence</B>which has a tendency to throw light on the mental
    condition of the defendant after the imposition of sentence
    provided the proof tends to prove or disprove the issue
    involved. Garrison v. People, 151 Colo. 388, 378 P.2d 401
    (1963).</P>
    <P>If evidence of a general type is otherwise competent,
    relevant and material, it is not inadmissible solely because it
    occurred prior to the time judgment and sentence entered in the
    criminal proceeding, or because it relates to his mental
    condition prior to such time. Garrison v. People, 151 Colo.
    388, 378 P.2d 401 (1963).</P>
    <P>Every act of the defendant's life relevant to the issue is
    admissible in evidence when the defense of insanity, general or
    partial, is set up. Garrison v. People, 151 Colo. 388, 378 P.2d
    401 (1963).</P>
    <P>
    <B>Evidence of prior mental illness relevant.</B>In a sanity
    trial evidence of a prior mental illness or abnormal conduct is
    relevant to the ultimate issue in the case, as such evidence
    renders the claimed inference of insanity more probable than it
    would be without the evidence. People v. Mack, 638 P.2d 257
    (Colo. 1981).</P>
    <P>
    <B>Second competency determination not required.</B>Although
    placing an accused on trial while he is incompetent violates
    due process of law, neither due process nor the defendant's
    right to effective assistance of counsel requires the court to
    grant a request for a second competency determination after the
    accused already has been granted an adequate hearing on his
    claimed incompetency. People v. Mack, 638 P.2d 257 (Colo.
    1981).</P>
    <P>Defendant failed to establish a due process violation or an
    abuse of discretion by the trial court in not ordering a second
    competency examination. People v. Stephenson, 165 P.3d 860
    (Colo. App. 2007).</P>
    <P>
    <B>Upon receiving an incomplete second evaluation, a court
    should order that</B>(1) the evaluator render an opinion based
    on the available information, if possible, despite the
    defendant's noncooperation or (2) the defendant be returned to
    the appropriate facility for further observation so that a
    competency opinion can be rendered. People v. Presson, 2013 COA
    120M, 315 P.3d 198.</P>
    <P>
    <B>Court erred in proceeding to determine defendant's
    competency to stand trial</B>when the second competency
    evaluation did not contain the statutorily required diagnosis,
    prognosis, and opinion, and the court declined to return
    defendant to the facility to complete the evaluation. People v.
    Presson, 2013 COA 120M, 315 P.3d 198.</P>
    <P>The error was not harmless because defendant was unfairly
    deprived of a second contemporaneous evaluation, to which
    defendant was statutorily entitled; the court explicitly relied
    on defendant's refusal to cooperate with the second evaluator
    in finding defendant competent; evidence of defendant's
    competency was not overwhelming; and a retrospective competency
    determination would not cure the error. People v. Presson, 2013
    COA 120M, 315 P.3d 198.</P>
    <P>
    <B>A trial court has the discretion to order a competency
    examination, and the statute does not restrict this discretion
    to formal examinations.</B>The trial court did not abuse its
    discretion by relying on a medical examination in lieu of a
    formal competency examination. Bloom v. People, 185 P.3d 797
    (Colo. 2008) (decided under repealed § 16-8-111).</P>
    <P>
    <B>Error to exclude cross-examination of medical witness.</B>In
    a post-conviction proceeding to determine the present mental
    condition of a defendant, refusal to permit cross-examination
    of a medical witness, who had testified that defendant was
    presently insane, as to his previous service on the commission
    which had determined defendant to be a mental incompetent, is
    erroneous. Garrison v. People, 151 Colo. 388, 378 P.2d 401
    (1963).</P>
    <P>
    <B>Judicial review.</B>Certain trial procedure safeguards are
    not applicable to the process of sentencing. This principle
    applies more forcefully to an effort to transplant every trial
    safeguard to a determination of incompetency after conviction.
    To require judicial review every time a convicted defendant
    suggests incompetency would make the possibility of carrying
    out a sentence depend upon fecundity in making suggestion after
    suggestion of incompetency. Leick v. People, 140 Colo. 564, 345
    P.2d 1054 (1959).</P>
    <P>
    <B>Trial court applied the incorrect legal standards in finding
    defendant competent to stand trial and, thus, abused its
    discretion.</B>Trial court improperly based competency
    determination solely on defendant's factual understanding of
    proceedings and cognitive ability with no consideration to
    whether defendant's perceptions and understandings were
    grounded in reality. People v. Mondragon, 217 P.3d 936 (Colo.
    App. 2009).</P>
    <P>
    <B>Motions to determine competency made under § 16-8.5-102 must
    include threshold requirements, and trial courts retain
    sufficient discretion to reject the rare competency motion that
    rests on counsel's inadequate proffer.</B>People v. Lindsey,
    2020 CO 21, 459 P.3d 530.</P>
    <P>Under the totality of the circumstances, including the
    competency motion filed by defendant's counsel that was bereft
    of specific facts supporting a good-faith doubt regarding
    defendant's competency, the trial court did not abuse its
    discretion in rejecting the motion as inadequate. People v.
    Lindsey, 2020 CO 21, 459 P.3d 530.</P>

  competency within the reasonably foreseeable future pursuant to
  section 16-8.5-105 (5)(e)(I)(B), (5)(e)(I)(C), or (5)(e)(I)(D),
  in lieu of ordering restoration treatment the court shall set a
  hearing within thirty-five days of receiving the report on the
  issue of whether there is a substantial probability that the
  defendant will be restored to competency within the reasonably
  foreseeable future and, in the case of a finding pursuant to
  section 16-8.5-105 (5)(e)(I)(D), maintain competency through the
  adjudication of the case. At the hearing, there is a presumption
  that the defendant will not attain competency within the
  reasonably foreseeable future. A party attempting to overcome
  that presumption must prove by a preponderance of the evidence
  that there is a substantial probability that restoration efforts
  will be successful within the reasonably foreseeable future. At
  the conclusion of the hearing when there is an opinion pursuant
  to section 16-8.5-105 (5)(e)(I)(D), if the court finds that there
  is not a substantial probability that the defendant will be
  restored to competency within the reasonably foreseeable future
  and maintain competency throughout the case, the court shall
  dismiss the case and may consider ordering the initiation of

  foreseeable future and maintain competency through the
  adjudication of the case, and the court shall dismiss the case

  restoration services. If the court does not order a personal
  recognizance bond and the defendant is committed for inpatient
  restoration, the court shall make findings of fact that

    repealed § 16-8-112, relevant cases construing that provision
    have been included in the annotations to this section. 
    <P>
    <B>Purpose of section.</B>This section considers the interests
    of both society and the individual accused and strikes a fair
    balance. A person who is found to be incompetent is treated and
    confined only to the extent necessary for the protection of
    society. Parks v. Denver District Court, 180 Colo. 202, 503
    P.2d 1029 (1972).</P>
    <P>
    <B>Commitment does not deny defendant due process.</B>The fact
    that the defendant may be committed to an institution for an
    indefinite period of time, before trial and pending the
    regaining of competency, affords and does not deny the
    defendant due process. Schwader v. District Court, 172 Colo.
    474, 474 P.2d 607 (1970).</P>
    <P>
    <B>A finding of incompetence to stand trial only results in an
    abatement of the criminal proceedings.</B>Parks v. Denver
    District Court, 180 Colo. 202, 503 P.2d 1029 (1972).</P>
    <P>
    <B>Court retains jurisdiction during confinement.</B>During
    confinement the court which commits the accused retains
    jurisdiction to oversee his commitment and to protect his
    constitutional rights and should do so. Parks v. Denver
    District Court, 180 Colo. 202, 503 P.2d 1029 (1972).</P>
    <P>
    <B>And it is the trial judge's duty to make periodic checks to
    determine the status and condition of an incompetent</B>who has
    criminal charges pending against him under any valid statute
    and who has been committed after a finding of incompetence to
    stand trial. Parks v. Denver District Court, 180 Colo. 202, 503
    P.2d 1029 (1972).</P>
    <P>
    <B>During commitment, there can be no final judgment subject to
    appeal.</B>Where defendant was committed following a
    determination that he became incompetent subsequent to alleged
    offense, and the issue raised by a plea of not guilty remains
    unresolved until defendant is determined to be able to stand
    trial, there can be no final judgment from which an appeal can
    be taken, as the litigation has not yet been terminated on its
    merits. Rupert v. People, 156 Colo. 277, 398 P.2d 434
    (1965).</P>
    <P>
    <B>Section does not preclude the release on bail of a person
    who is determined to be incompetent and charged with a violent
    crime.</B>People v. White, 819 P.2d 1096 (Colo. App. 1991).</P>
    <P>
    <B>The court of appeals can order a limited remand to the
    district court for restoration proceedings pursuant to this
    section</B>for future determination of motions to dismiss
    counsel and dismiss the appeal. People v. Liggett, 2018 COA
    94M, 490 P.3d 405.</P>

  <M>If a defendant committed to the custody of the department for

  requirements for the administration of involuntary medication,
  the defendant's treating physician may petition the court for an
  order requiring that the defendant accept the treatment or,
  alternatively, that the medication be forcibly administered to
  the defendant. The department shall, prior to the hearing on the
  petition, deliver a copy of the petition to the court that
  committed the defendant to the custody of the department, the
  prosecuting attorney, and the defendant's legal representation in
  the criminal case, if such representation exists, and to the
  defendant directly if he or she does not have legal
  representation. A physician shall assess and document the
  defendant's mental status prior to the administration of
  medication.</M>

  <M>If the committing court elects to transfer venue for

  incurred in conducting the proceeding. Alternatively, the
  district attorney for the committing county, or in any county or

  and is subsequently returned to jail for pending court
  proceedings, the county jail may require the defendant to
  continue to receive the same court-ordered treatment that was
  administered by the department before the defendant was
  discharged from inpatient care, or, alternatively, appropriate
  medical personnel provided by the jail may forcibly administer
  such court-ordered medication to the

  <ANNO-NOTE>
    <ANNO-TEXT>
    <B>Annotator's note.</B>Since § 16-8.5-116 is similar to
    repealed § 16-8-114.5, as it existed in 1986, a relevant case
    construing that provision has been included in the annotations
    to this section. 
    <P>
    <B>This section as amended in 1989 gives the district attorney
    the authority to initiate the termination of criminal
    proceedings against an incompetent defendant.</B>The statute
    does not, however, give the district attorney the power to
    dictate whether the defendant will be released or civilly
    committed once the trial court determines that there is not a
    substantial probability that the defendant will be restored to
    competency in the foreseeable future. People v. Zapotocky, 869
    P.2d 1234 (Colo. 1994).</P>
    <P>
    <B>Trial court incorrectly declared this statute to be an
    unconstitutional violation of due process</B>where it
    erroneously believed that the defendant has a right to
    dismissal of criminal charges if it does not appear reasonably
    likely that he will be competent to stand trial in the future.
    People v. Zapotocky, 869 P.2d 1234 (Colo. 1994).</P>
    <P>
    <B>The decision to request dismissal of pending criminal
    charges is within the district attorney's discretion</B>and the
    decision may not be controlled or limited by judicial
    intervention. Therefore, transferring the decision to dismiss
    pending criminal proceedings against incompetent defendants
    from the trial court to the district attorney is consistent
    with the traditional powers of the trial court and the
    prosecutor. People v. Zapotocky, 869 P.2d 1234 (Colo.
    1994).</P>
    <P>
    <B>Since under the pre-1989 and post-1989 versions of
    subsection (2), a court cannot terminate criminal proceedings
    against an incompetent defendant until a finding of indefinite
    incompetency is made,</B>and the trial court did not make such
    a finding until after the statute was amended, application of
    the amended statute did not violate the ex post facto clauses
    of the United States constitution or Colorado constitution.
    People v. Zapotocky, 869 P.2d 1234 (Colo. 1994).</P>
    <P>
    <B>A court order dismissing the charges against the defendant
    based on a finding that the defendant was incompetent to
    proceed with no probability of restoration is a final,
    appealable order.</B>People v. Ong, 2021 COA 113, 499 P.3d
    375.</P>
    <P>
    <B>A stay issued under subsection (10) of a dismissal order
    issued under subsection (4) does not extend the finality of the
    order for purposes of timely filing an appeal.</B>There was
    nothing more for the court to do in the competency proceedings,
    and the stay was issued to facilitate the transfer of the case
    from the criminal court to civil mental health proceedings.

    <B>Method for compelling attendance of out-of-state
    witnesses.</B>This uniform act provides a method whereby, among
    states that have adopted the act, a court of one state may
    certify the need for the appearance and testimony of a material
    witness residing in another state and thereby invoke the
    authority of the court in the resident state to compel the
    witness's attendance in the certifying court. Hence, at least
    under the circumstances specified in the statute, a Colorado
    court may now compel the attendance of out-of-state witnesses.
    People v. McCabe, 37 Colo. App. 181, 546 P.2d 1289 (1975). 
    <P>
    <B>Payment for witnesses is the obligation of the state.</B>In
    concluding that the courts lack the ability to compel the
    attendance of out-of-state witnesses for an indigent defendant,
    a court's reliance upon the silence of the uniform act as to
    the source of any money to be paid to the witness was misplaced
    in Colorado. The failure of the uniform act to address this
    issue does not support this conclusion since the statutes and
    rules of criminal procedure both create the obligation and
    provide for payment. People v. McCabe, 37 Colo. App. 181, 546
    P.2d 1289 (1975).</P>
    <P>
    <B>The provisions of this part 2 do not extend to authorizing a
    court to subpoena a witness who is residing outside the United
    States.</B>The district court erred in granting a motion under
    the provisions of rule 15 of the Colorado rules of criminal
    procedure to depose a witness residing in Mexico. The rule
    requires that the deposition be conducted in the presence of
    the court and requires the court to subpoena the witness. The
    court does not have jurisdiction to subpoena a witness who
    resides in another country because the provisions of this part
    2 extend only to other states that have adopted a similar law,
    not to foreign countries. Without another statute authorizing
    such a subpoena, the court was proceeding without jurisdiction.

    <B>Annotator's note.</B>Since § 16-9-203 is similar to repealed
    § 39-6-3, C.R.S. 1963, and CSA, C. 48, § 467(3), relevant cases
    construing those provisions have been included in the

    <B>Post-conviction hearing is a criminal proceeding under this

    <P>
    <B>Liable for advancements to such witnesses.</B>Since the
    state will ultimately pay the costs of securing out-of-state
    witnesses for the defendant, there is no legal justification
    for holding that it is not liable for advancement of such costs
    as mileage and witness fees. People v. McCabe, 37 Colo. App.

    <B>Abuse of discretion in denying continuance.</B>Since
    testimony of missing out-of-state witnesses might well have led
    to defendant's acquittal, it follows that it was an abuse of
    discretion to deny defendant a continuance for the purpose of
    determining whether the provisions of this section and Crim. P.

  hearing. If the court is satisfied at the hearing that the
  requested custody and delivery is desirable, the court shall
  order that the witness be taken into custody and delivered to an
  officer of the requesting county for said hearing, if said
  hearing is to commence within forty-eight hours of the issuance

    <B>Fundamental right to trial by jury in criminal cases is
    paramount constitutional right</B>guaranteed by the sixth
    amendment to the United States constitution and § 23 of art.
    II, Colo. Const. People v. Evans, 44 Colo. App. 288, 612 P.2d
    1153 (1980). 
    <P>
    <B>A person does not have a right to a jury trial</B>upon being
    found in contempt of court if the person is not subject to more
    than six months incarceration upon issuance of such citation.
    People v. Barron, 677 P.2d 1370 (Colo. 1984); Kourlis v. Port,
    18 P.3d 770 (Colo. App. 2000).</P>
    <P>
    <B>This section extends a statutory right to a jury trial only
    to violations of state statutes</B>not contempt charges. People
    v. Shell, 148 P.3d 162 (Colo. 2006).</P>
    <P>
    <B>Death qualified juries are not more prone to convict than to
    acquit</B>and do not deny a defendant his right to an impartial
    jury. People v. Manier, 184 Colo. 44, 518 P.2d 811 (1974).</P>
    <P>
    <B>Defendant may waive his right to jury trial;</B>however,
    that waiver must be understandingly, voluntarily, and
    deliberately made, and a determination of waiver must be a
    matter of certainty and not implication. People v. Evans, 44
    Colo. App. 288, 612 P.2d 1153 (1980).</P>
    <P>
    <B>But defendant must personally express waiver.</B>Where, the
    prosecution conceded that prior to the time defendant requested
    a jury trial he had not personally expressed a waiver of his
    right to trial by a jury, trial court, which, in reviewing the
    question of whether to grant a jury trial, questioned defendant
    concerning his understanding relative to counsel's waiver of
    his rights the previous day and which concluded that because
    defendant had concurred in counsel's request the waiver was
    valid, did not comport with the requirement of Crim. P.
    23(a)(5) because the waiver must be expressed by defendant
    personally at the time that the waiver is attempted. People v.
    Evans, 44 Colo. App. 288, 612 P.2d 1153 (1980).</P>
    <P>
    <B>Under unitary trial provision, defendant does not possess a
    statutory right to a jury trial on the merits and the
    affirmative defense of insanity</B>if a plea of not guilty by
    reason of insanity was entered and stipulated to by the
    prosecution. People v. Laeke, 2012 CO 13M, 271 P.3d 1111, cert.
    denied, 568 U.S. 829, 133 S. Ct. 109, 184 L. Ed. 2d 51
    (2012).</P>
    <P>
    <B>Valid waiver of jury trial does not require extensive,
    on-the-record advisements</B>of the kind set out in United
    States v. Robertson, 45 F. 3d 1423 (10th Cir. 1995). People v.
    Thompson, 121 P.3d 273 (Colo. App. 2005).</P>
    <P>
    <B>Defendant voluntarily waived jury.</B>Where, when the jury
    was assembled in the courtroom ready for trial, defendants'
    counsel orally announced that defendants had decided to waive
    their right to a jury trial, and the court inquired of each
    defendant if that was his desire and both indicated in the
    affirmative, and, as a further precaution, the court then
    insisted that a written waiver of jury trial be prepared and be
    signed by each defendant and counsel, which was done, it will
    be presumed that defendants understandingly, voluntarily, and
    deliberately decided to waive the jury. People v. Fowler, 183
    Colo. 300, 516 P.2d 428 (1973).</P>
    <P>Where the record of the trial court discloses that the trial
    judge orally advised the defendant of his right to a jury, that
    the defendant read and signed a written waiver, and that he
    failed to give any indication to the trial court that his
    waiver was not voluntary, the record was substantial evidence
    to support the findings that the waiver was voluntary. People
    v. Simms, 185 Colo. 214, 523 P.2d 463 (1974).</P>
    <P>
    <B>Waiver precludes defendant's complaint that judge rules on
    evidence and renders verdict.</B>Where the defendant
    voluntarily and with advice of counsel waived a jury trial,
    defendant in such circumstances cannot be heard to complain
    when he creates a situation which necessarily makes the trial
    judge both the one who decides the admissibility of evidence
    and the one who renders the verdict. People v. Thompson, 182
    Colo. 198, 511 P.2d 909 (1973).</P>
    <P>
    <B>Colorado constitution does not afford criminal defendants
    the right to waive jury</B>and be tried by the court. People v.
    District Court, 843 P.2d 6 (Colo. 1992); People v. District
    Court, 953 P.2d 184 (Colo. 1998).</P>
    <P>
    <B>A court exceeds its jurisdiction if it allows a defendant to
    waive his or her right to a jury trial over the objection of
    the district attorney</B>based on defendant's claim that his
    due process rights would be violated by testifying and that he
    would be subject to impeachment about his past criminal
    convictions and his ties to drug use. It is not a due process
    violation to be subject to impeachment about prior criminal
    convictions; the choice to testify or not is part of
    adversarial trial process and does not create an unfair trial
    for the defendant. People v. McKeel, 246 P.3d 638 (Colo.
    2010).</P>
    <P>
    <B>In construing the provisions of this section with § 18-1-406
    (2), granting the defendant the right to waive a jury
    trial,</B>due process compels conclusion that prosecution alone
    cannot compel trial by jury where defendant may not receive a
    fair trial. People v. District Court, 843 P.2d 6 (Colo.
    1992).</P>
    <P>
    <B>Provisions of this section which require the people's
    consent as a prerequisite to defendant's waiver of trial by
    jury held facially constitutional;</B>however as applied may
    violate an accused's right to due process. People v. District
    Court, 843 P.2d 6 (Colo. 1992).</P>
    <P>
    <B>Unqualified prosecution consent requirement to defendant's
    waiver of trial by jury may violate defendant's constitutional
    right to due process</B>where defendant contends that such
    trial would constitute an unfair proceeding before a biased
    jury. People v. District Court, 843 P.2d 6 (Colo. 1992).</P>
    <P>
    <B>It is incumbent upon a criminal defendant, in seeking waiver
    of jury trial, to raise due process concerns with the trial
    court;</B>trial court may evaluate whether a defendant's due
    process rights are violated only after the defendant makes a
    showing that an inability to waive trial by jury infringes on
    defendant's due process rights. People v. District Court, 843
    P.2d 6 (Colo. 1992).</P>
    <P>
    <B>In determining whether defendant's right to a fair trial
    would be violated by denying defendant's waiver of jury trial,
    trial court may consider</B>the extent to which a change in
    venue may cure bias or prejudice against the defendant. People
    v. District Court, 843 P.2d 6 (Colo. 1992).</P>
    <P>
    <B>Due process does not require the prosecution to consent to a
    waiver of a jury trial</B>in a trial for possession of a weapon
    by a prior offender merely because the jury will hear evidence
    of a prior offense even if one of the prior offenses was for a
    similar weapons offense. People v. District Court, 953 P.2d 184

    <B>Right to impartial jury.</B>It is fundamental to the right

    jury. Nailor v. People, 200 Colo. 30, 612 P.2d 79 (1980).</P>
    <P>This section implements that right. People v. Russo, 713

    <P>
    <B>A defendant has a fundamental right to a fair trial by a
    panel of impartial jurors,</B>and, to protect that right, the
    trial court must exclude prejudiced or biased persons from the
    jury. People v. Ferrero, 874 P.2d 468 (Colo. App. 1993).</P>
    <P>
    <B>However, the trial court may consider a potential juror's
    assurances that the juror can fairly and impartially serve on
    the case</B>in determining whether that juror will be able to
    set aside a preconceived notion and render an impartial verdict
    according to the law and the evidence admitted at trial. People
    v. Ferrero, 874 P.2d 468 (Colo. App. 1993); People v. Loggins,

    <B>Neither the prosecution nor the defendant is granted any
    right in this jurisdiction, by constitution, statute, or rule,
    to shape the composition of the jury through the use of
    peremptory challenges.</B>The defendant could not have been
    harmed by the deprivation of any such right. Vigil v. People,
    2019 CO 105, 455 P.3d 332.</P>
    <P>Trial court did not abuse its discretion in denying
    challenge for cause. It was the trial court's role to assess
    and decide whether the juror could assess the victim's
    testimony like any other witness's testimony even though the
    juror had a prior relationship with the victim's family. Vigil
    v. People, 2019 CO 105, 455 P.3d 332.</P>
    <P>
    <B>A trial court should do one of three things if a prospective
    juror indicates an unwillingness to apply the law:</B>(1)
    Dismiss the juror for cause; (2) conduct rehabilitative
    questioning following up on the juror's concerning statements
    before denying the challenge for cause; or (3) make findings on
    the record explaining why the juror's statements indicating an
    unwillingness or inability to follow the law should be
    disregarded in light of other seemingly inconsistent
    statements. People v. Marciano, 2014 COA 92M, 411 P.3d 831.</P>
    <P>
    <B>Standard of review is "abuse of discretion".</B>Phrases used
    in prior case law such as "clear abuse of discretion" and
    "gross abuse of discretion" are deemed to express this standard
    and have the same meaning. Carrillo v. People, 974 P.2d 478
    (Colo. 1999); People v. Vecchiarelli-McLaughlin, 984 P.2d 72
    (Colo. 1999); People v. Martinez, 18 P.3d 831 (Colo. App.
    2000); People v. Dashner, 77 P.3d 787 (Colo. App. 2003).</P>
    <P>The trial court did not abuse its discretion for denying a
    challenge for cause when there was reasonable evidence that the
    juror would be impartial. Therefore, the appellate court erred
    when it overturned a conviction on the basis that the juror
    thought that being charged was evidence of guilt because
    subsequent questioning demonstrated to the trial court that the
    juror would base his decision on "the facts". People v. Young,
    16 P.3d 821 (Colo. 2001).</P>
    <P>The trial court did not abuse its discretion in denying a
    challenge for cause where, in a case involving a homosexual
    defendant charged with sexual assault, the prospective juror
    initially stated she had a religious objection to
    homosexuality. It was within the court's discretion to rely on
    the prospective juror's later statements that, based on the
    evidence presented, she would decide whether the defendant
    committed an illegal act rather than judge him on his sexual
    preference. People v. Hoskay, 87 P.3d 194 (Colo. App. 2003);
    People v. Simon, 100 P.3d 487 (Colo. App. 2004).</P>
    <P>
    <B>It is within the trial court's prerogative to give
    considerable weight to a potential juror's statement</B>that he
    or she can fairly and impartially serve on the case. People v.
    Montoya, 942 P.2d 1287 (Colo. App. 1996); People v. Young, 16
    P.3d 821 (Colo. 2001).</P>
    <P>
    <B>When the trial court grants the prosecution's for-cause
    challenge of a prospective juror, reversal is not required when
    the claim is that the court abused its discretion.</B>Because
    the prospective juror did not sit in judgment of the case, that
    ruling could not have deprived the defendant of his
    constitutional right to a fair and impartial jury; and because
    neither the prosecution nor the defendant is granted any right
    in this jurisdiction, by constitution, statute, or rule, to
    shape the composition of the jury through the use of peremptory
    challenges, the defendant could not have been harmed by the
    deprivation of any such right. Vigil v. People, 2019 CO 105,
    455 P.3d 332.</P>
    <P>

    <B>This section controls over court rule.</B>Peremptory
    challenges, while not constitutionally required, are deemed to
    be an effective means of securing a more impartial and better
    qualified jury and, as such, are an important right of an
    accused. While also having an incidental effect on trial
    procedure, this section is primarily an expression of policy
    concerning this right of the accused, a substantive matter,
    and, thus, controls over Crim. P. 24(d). People v. Hollis, 670
    P.2d 441 (Colo. App. 1983).</P>
    <P>
    <B>Although the statute refers to the number of challenges in
    capital cases, it does not define "capital case".</B>By
    contrast, Crim. P. 24(d)(1) does define the term. The rule and
    the statute, therefore, do not "conflict" in the sense of being
    irreconcilable or necessarily incompatible with each other, and
    the rule can be given effect without producing a result
    irreconcilable with the plain language of the statute. People
    v. Reynolds, 159 P.3d 684 (Colo. App. 2006).</P>
    <P>
    <B>There is no conflict between the number of peremptory
    challenges provided by this section and Crim. P. 24(d)(4)
    regarding nonreduction of peremptory challenges where there has
    been a waiver.</B>Where counsel waives a peremptory challenge,
    counsel does not lose that challenge and can still take
    advantage of all available peremptory challenges to which the
    party is entitled, so long as, after waiver, at least one new
    juror is called into the jury box. People v. Terhorst, 2015 COA
    110, 360 P.3d 239.</P>
    <P>
    <B>Denial of right to use all challenges is reversible
    error.</B>The denial of the right of a party to use all of his
    peremptory challenges creates a jury which is not a statutory
    tribunal and therefore constitutes reversible error. People v.
    Haines, 37 Colo. App. 302, 549 P.2d 786 (1976).</P>
    <P>
    <B>Although right to peremptory challenges is not
    constitutional,</B>failure to allow defendant peremptory
    challenges as provided in this section violates defendant's due
    process rights. People v. Vieyra, 169 P.3d 205 (Colo. App.
    2007).</P>
    <P>
    <B>Trial court need not remind defendant of remaining
    peremptory challenges</B>because it is counsel's duty, and not
    a responsibility of the court, to track such challenges. People
    v. Vieyra, 169 P.3d 205 (Colo. App. 2007).</P>
    <P>
    <B>Defendant failed to prove beyond a reasonable doubt that
    statute is unconstitutional as applied to defendants jointly
    tried,</B>as peremptory challenges are not constitutionally
    required and statute is rationally related to a legitimate
    state interest. People v. Gardenhire, 903 P.2d 1159 (Colo. App.
    1995).</P>
    <P>
    <B>Statute does not unconstitutionally discriminate against a

    <P>
    <B>Reversal of a criminal conviction for other than structural
    error is not required absent an express legislative mandate
    or</B>an appropriate case-specific outcome-determinative
    analysis. Allowing a defendant fewer peremptory challenges than
    authorized or than exercised by the prosecution is not
    structural error requiring reversal. People v. Novotny, 2014 CO

    <B>Trial court's failure to excuse juror for cause was
    harmless.</B>Defendant used a peremptory challenge to correct
    the court's failure to remove the juror. But the record did not

    and therefore defendant could not establish he was harmed by
    the trial court's erroneous failure to excuse the juror for

    <P>
    <B>Prejudicial error</B>occurred when a defendant was required

    available peremptory challenges on the other jurors. People v.

    <B>Prejudice is shown if defendant exhausts all of his

    <P>
    <B>No error occurred when trial court properly denied
    defendant's motion for cause challenge to a juror who would
    base her decision on the evidence presented at trial and who
    would follow the court's instructions concerning the
    presumption of innocence;</B>defendant cannot claim prejudice
    for his choice not to excuse the juror by use of a peremptory
    challenge. Morrison v. People, 19 P.3d 668 (Colo. 2000); People
    v. Honeysette, 53 P.3d 714 (Colo. App. 2002).</P>
    <P>
    <B>Where the trial court improperly removed jurors for cause
    and the prosecution subsequently used all of its peremptory
    challenges, the prosecution enjoyed an unfair tactical
    advantage in determining the makeup of the jury, detrimentally
    affecting the rights of the defendant and requiring a new
    trial.</B>Improperly dismissing some jurors for cause has the
    effect of granting additional peremptory challenges to the
    prosecution. It is irrelevant that the defendant has full
    ability to use his peremptory challenges. The prosecution's
    relatively greater ability to remove jurors it views as
    objectionable is independently prejudicial to the defendant's
    rights, and the court will presume prejudice to the defendant.

    <B>Presumption of prejudice held sufficiently rebutted</B>where
    juror was replaced for an obvious and bona fide hearing
    impairment, court carefully instructed remaining jurors and the
    alternate juror to start their deliberations anew, the jury
    physically tore up and discarded their notes from the earlier
    deliberations, and the second set of deliberations took two
    hours longer than the first. Carrillo v. People, 974 P.2d 478

    not ask regular jurors if they were capable of disregarding
    their previous deliberations or if they would be receptive to
    an alternate juror's attempt to assert a non-conforming view
    and did not ask alternate juror about his activities after
    being discharged or his present ability to serve on the jury,
    trial court did not take extraordinary measures to ensure that
    defendant would not be prejudiced by such mid-deliberation
    replacement and, as a result thereof, defendant's conviction
    required reversal. People v. Burnette, 753 P.2d 773 (Colo. App.

    <P>
    <B>This section is not in agreement with Crim. P.
    24(e)</B>because this section requires that jurors may be
    replaced with alternate jurors before deliberations begin and
    not after. Since the court rules govern practice and procedure
    in civil and criminal cases while the statute affects the
    substantive right to a fair trial, this section is the
    operative provision in deciding that the trial court erred by
    applying Crim. P. 24(e) and allowing the replacement of a
    regular juror with at alternate juror after the jury had begun
    its deliberations. People v. Montoya, 942 P.2d 1287 (Colo. App.

    <P>
    <B>Court's decision to replace a sleeping juror was not an
    abuse of discretion.</B>Although a defendant is entitled to a

    <B>Although there is a statutory right to a unanimous verdict
    in criminal cases in Colorado, the state constitution does not
    explicitly guarantee the right to a unanimous
    verdict.</B>Nevertheless, there are some cases in which the
    jury may return a general verdict of guilty when instructed on
    alternative theories of principal and complicitor liability and
    in which the state constitution has provided a criminal
    defendant the right to a unanimous jury verdict. People v.
    Hall, 60 P.3d 728 (Colo. App. 2002).

    <P>
    <B>Retrial of defendant on kidnapping charge, after the first
    trial was declared a mistrial without objection from either
    party, did not violate statute requiring the verdict of the

    because the federal constitution does not guarantee a defendant
    a unanimous verdict of either guilty or not guilty. People v.
    Barton, 58 P.3d 1075 (Colo. App. 2002).</P>
    <P>
    <B>Unanimity is required only with respect to ultimate issue of
    defendant's guilt</B>or innocence of the crime charged and not
    with respect to alternative means by which the crime was
    committed. People v. Taggart, 621 P.2d 1375 (Colo. 1981);

    40M, 488 P.3d 186.</P>
    <P>If the court has not required the prosecution to elect the
    transaction on which it relies for conviction, to ensure jury
    unanimity, the jury must be instructed that to convict the
    defendant it must unanimously agree that the defendant
    committed the same act or committed all the acts within the
    period charged. People v. Rivera, 56 P.3d 1155 (Colo. App.
    2002); People v. Gookins, 111 P.3d 525 (Colo. App. 2004).</P>
    <P>Failure of trial court to give unanimity instruction
    constitutes plain error if that failure results in confusion
    whether jurors' conviction was based upon a true unanimity or
    whether different incidents formed the basis for the conclusion
    of individual jurors. In cases involving multiple acts,
    unanimity instruction assures that the jury does not base its
    conviction upon some jurors finding that one act was committed
    while others rely on a different act. People v. Devine, 74 P.3d
    440 (Colo. App. 2003).</P>
    <P>
    <B>When evidence of several acts is presented at trial, any one
    of which could form the basis of the offense, the court must
    either:</B>(1) Require the prosecution to elect the act that
    it's relying upon for the conviction, or (2) instruct the jury
    that they must unanimously agree on a specific act defendant
    committed that serves as the basis for the conviction. Quintano
    v. People, 105 P.3d 585 (Colo. 2005); People v. Childress, 2012

    155.</P>
    <P>The defendant did not waive her unanimity argument but
    forfeited it. It was not plain error by the trial court for not
    requiring an election or giving a modified unanimity
    instruction. People v. Wester-Gravelle, 2020 CO 64, 465 P.3d
    570.</P>
    <P>
    <B>Consideration of lesser charge permitted without acquittal
    of greater charge.</B>Acquittal of a greater charge by a

    consider a lesser included offense. People v. McGregor, 635
    P.2d 912 (Colo. App. 1981).</P>
    <P>
    <B>The jury instruction for felony menacing which did not
    specify a particular victim,</B>coupled with the comments of
    the prosecutor, invited the jury to convict without regard to
    the identity of the victim, making it impossible to determine
    whether the jury unanimously convicted defendant on the basis
    of menacing the same victim. People v. Simmons, 973 P.2d 627
    (Colo. App. 1998).</P>
    <P>
    <B>The court did not commit plain error when it failed to
    instruct the jury that it must unanimously agree on the
    underlying felony for the first degree burglary
    conviction.</B>Because the jury unanimously found defendant
    guilty of attempted aggravated robbery, the finding satisfied
    the intent requirement of first degree burglary as well as any
    requirement that the jury agree unanimously to the underlying
    offense. Therefore, the court's failure to give a unanimity
    instruction was not plain error because there was no reasonable
    possibility that any error contributed to defendant's
    conviction. People v. Linares-Guzman, 195 P.3d 1130 (Colo. App.

  <M>Trial by jury for petty offenses.</M></CATCH-LINE>(1)
  <M>For the purposes of this section, "petty offense" means any
  crime or offense classified as a petty offense or, if not so
  classified, which is punishable by imprisonment other than in a
  correctional facility for not more than six months, or by a fine
  of not more than five hundred dollars, or by both such
  imprisonment and fine, and includes any violation of a municipal
  ordinance or offense which was not considered a crime at common
  law; except that violation of a municipal traffic ordinance which
  does not constitute a criminal offense or any other municipal
  charter, municipal ordinance, or county ordinance offense which
  is neither criminal nor punishable by imprisonment under any
  counterpart state statute shall not constitute a petty offense.
  No child under the age of eighteen years shall be entitled to a
  trial by jury for a violation of a municipal ordinance or a
  county ordinance for which imprisonment in jail is not a possible
  penalty. Nothing in this subsection (1) shall prohibit a
  municipality or county from granting a right to trial by jury for
  ordinance violations.</M>
  <P N="(2)">(2)
  <M>A defendant charged with a petty offense shall be entitled to
  a jury trial if, within twenty-one days after entry of a plea,
  the defendant makes a request to the court for a jury trial, in
  writing, and tenders to the court a jury fee of twenty-five
  dollars unless the fee is waived by the judge because of the
  indigence of the defendant. The jury shall consist of three
  jurors unless a greater number, not to exceed six, is requested
  by the defendant in said jury demand. If the charge is dismissed
  or the defendant is acquitted of the charge or if the defendant,
  having paid the jury fee, files with the court at least seven
  days before the scheduled trial date a written waiver of jury
  trial, the jury fee shall be refunded.</M></P>
  <P N="(3)">(3)
  <M>At the time of arraignment for any petty offense in this
  state, the judge shall advise any defendant not represented by
  counsel of the defendant's right to trial by jury, of the
  requirement that the defendant, if he or she desires to invoke
  his or her right to trial by jury, request such trial by jury
  within twenty-one days after entry of a plea, in writing, of the
  number of jurors allowed by law, and of the requirement that the
  defendant, if he or she desires to invoke his or her right to
  trial by jury, tender to the court within twenty-one days after
  entry of a plea a jury fee of twenty-five dollars unless the fee
  is waived by the judge because of the indigence of the

    <B>A first-time charge of driving while ability impaired is not
    a petty offense.</B>The general assembly's placement of
    numerous alcohol and drug-related offenses in a single statute
    demonstrates an intention not to treat first-time driving while
    ability impaired offenses as petty offenses. The penalties are
    dependent upon circumstances that may not be known by the court
    at the time of arraignment. The penalties for a first-time
    offense may easily exceed those of a petty offense under this

    <P>
    <B>This section is constitutional.</B>People v. Mulligan, 193
    Colo. 509, 568 P.2d 449 (1977).</P>
    <P>
    <B>This section is not unconstitutional as ex post facto
    legislation.</B>People v. Bastardo, 646 P.2d 382 (Colo.
    1982).</P>
    <P>
    <B>This section changes the common-law rule</B>that one could
    not impeach his own witness absent surprise or hostility and,
    in a criminal trial, if a witness has made a prior inconsistent
    statement purporting to relate to a matter within his
    knowledge, that fact may be shown where the safeguards of
    subsection (1)(a) are met. People v. Stewart, 39 Colo. App.
    142, 568 P.2d 65 (1977).</P>
    <P>
    <B>This section, rather than C.R.E. 613, controls</B>the
    admissibility of prior inconsistent statements for substantive
    purposes in a criminal case. Montoya v. People, 740 P.2d 992
    (Colo. 1987).</P>
    <P>
    <B>Comparing this section to C.R.E. 613,</B>it is clear that
    the rule is directed to situations in which a prior
    inconsistent statement is used for impeachment purposes only,
    but this section eliminates the hearsay impediment to using
    prior inconsistent statements for proving the truth of matters
    asserted so long as statutory foundation requirements for
    admissibility of the evidence have been satisfied. People v.
    Madril, 746 P.2d 1329 (Colo. 1987); People v. Fisher, 904 P.2d
    1326 (Colo. App. 1994); People v. Candelaria, 107 P.3d 1080
    (Colo. App. 2004), aff'd in part and rev'd in part on other
    grounds, 148 P.3d 178 (Colo. 2006).</P>
    <P>
    <B>The general rule, prior to the adoption of C.R.E.
    806,</B>was that inconsistent statements used to impeach a
    witness were not admissible unless the witness had been asked
    about the time and place and to whom the statement was made.
    People v. Madonna, 651 P.2d 378 (Colo. 1982).</P>
    <P>
    <B>Under this section neither surprise nor hostility is
    required to impeach one's own witness.</B>People v. Mulligan,
    193 Colo. 509, 568 P.2d 449 (1977).</P>
    <P>Once the statutory foundation has been laid, a witness's
    prior inconsistent statements become admissible without a
    showing of surprise or hostility. People v. Pepper, 193 Colo.
    505, 568 P.2d 446 (1977).</P>
    <P>If prior statements of a witness appear inconsistent and the
    two statutory conditions are adequately established, this
    section mandates admission of prior inconsistent statements
    even as against a party's own witness, whether that party be
    the prosecution or the defense. People v. Grant, 40 Colo. App.
    46, 571 P.2d 1111 (1977).</P>
    <P>
    <B>When defendant takes stand in own defense, he becomes a
    "witness"</B>within the meaning of this section. People v.
    Evans, 630 P.2d 94 (Colo. App. 1981).</P>
    <P>
    <B>Requirements of section held met.</B>Where defendant's
    counsel declined to cross-examine the witness, and at the close
    of his testimony the court specifically instructed the witness
    to remain available for recall, the requirements of this
    section were satisfied. People v. Grant, 40 Colo. App. 46, 571
    P.2d 1111 (1977).</P>
    <P>
    <B>Requirements for admission of evidence of prior inconsistent
    statement.</B>Evidence that a witness made a prior inconsistent
    statement is admissible if the statement is inconsistent, the
    witness is given an opportunity to explain or deny the
    statement or is available for recall, the statement purports to
    relate to a matter within the witness's personal knowledge, and
    the evidence offered to prove that the prior inconsistent
    statement was made is "otherwise competent". People v. Card, 42
    Colo. App. 259, 596 P.2d 402 (1979); People v. Candelaria, 107
    P.3d 1080 (Colo. App. 2004), aff'd in part and rev'd in part on
    other grounds, 148 P.3d 178 (Colo. 2006).</P>
    <P>
    <B>Prior inconsistent statement properly admissible</B>under
    this section for both substantive and impeachment purposes
    where witness was still testifying when the court ruled on
    admissibility of statement and so had opportunity to explain
    prior statement, and where witness was testifying regarding
    matters within his own knowledge. People v. Jenkins, 768 P.2d
    727 (Colo. App. 1988); People v. Fisher, 904 P.2d 1326 (Colo.
    App. 1994).</P>
    <P>
    <B>Statements obtained in violation of Miranda admissible for
    impeachment only.</B>Prior inconsistent statements obtained in
    violation of Miranda are competent only to the extent that they
    are introduced for purposes of impeachment; they are not
    admissible as substantive evidence of guilt. People v. Evans,
    630 P.2d 94 (Colo. App. 1981).</P>
    <P>
    <B>Where statement admitted for impeachment only, instruction
    to that effect required.</B>If the court concludes that a prior
    inconsistent statement may not be offered for the truth of the
    fact to which it relates, but still may be used for the limited
    purpose of impeachment, then an instruction to that effect
    should be given contemporaneously, thus limiting the jury's
    consideration of the specific evidence to impeachment of the
    witness. People v. District Court, 195 Colo. 570, 580 P.2d 388
    (1978).</P>
    <P>
    <B>Witness's memory loss regarding prior inconsistent
    statements.</B>Where a witness takes the stand and is available
    for cross-examination, the witness's actual or feigned memory
    loss even if memory loss is total regarding prior inconsistent
    statements does not violate a defendant's confrontation right.
    People v. Pepper, 193 Colo. 505, 568 P.2d 446 (1977).</P>
    <P>Where witness denied or could not recall any participation
    by defendant in the alleged drug transaction, the trial court
    properly allowed the prosecution to bring witness's earlier
    contradictory statements to her attention after laying a proper
    foundation under this section. People v. Aguirre, 839 P.2d 483
    (Colo. App. 1992).</P>
    <P>
    <B>Inability to remember statement deemed denial
    thereof.</B>For the purpose of introducing the prior testimony
    of a witness, the witness's inability to remember a statement
    is tantamount to a denial that he made the statement. People v.
    Baca, 633 P.2d 528 (Colo. App. 1981); People v. Leverton, 2017
    COA 34, 405 P.3d 402.</P>
    <P>
    <B>Evidence of prior consistent statements may be used only to
    rebut prior inconsistent statements.</B>People v. Fletcher, 37
    Colo. App. 173, 546 P.2d 980 (1975), rev'd on other grounds,
    193 Colo. 314, 566 P.2d 345 (1977).</P>
    <P>
    <B>In contrast to the common-law rule, this section does not
    require the predicate of hostility or surprise.</B>People v.
    Hawthorne, 190 Colo. 437, 548 P.2d 124 (1976).</P>
    <P>
    <B>This section prefaces admission of statement admitted at
    prior trial of witness upon a sequence of events.</B>First, the
    witness must have made a previous statement, and second, the
    previous statement must be inconsistent with the testimony of
    the witness at trial. People v. Smith, 192 Colo. 271, 559 P.2d
    221 (1976).</P>
    <P>
    <B>Where the codefendant made no statement at trial,</B>the
    requirements of the statute were not met. Consequently, this
    section is inapposite. People v. Smith, 192 Colo. 271, 559 P.2d
    221 (1976).</P>
    <P>
    <B>When a defendant does not testify,</B>the defendant's
    voluntary, unwarned custodial statements may not be used either
    to rebut the defendant's theory of defense or to impeach a
    witness other than the defendant. People v. Trujillo, 49 P.3d
    316 (Colo. 2002) (following James v. Illinois, 493 U.S. 307
    (1990)).</P>
    <P>
    <B>When mandate of section fulfilled.</B>The mandate of this
    section is adequately fulfilled if from all the circumstances
    it appears that the prior statement was inconsistent and the
    statutory conditions were adequately established. People v.
    Bastardo, 191 Colo. 521, 554 P.2d 297 (1976).</P>
    <P>
    <B>Court is not required to make certain findings.</B>The court
    is not required to make findings that proffered statements are
    in fact inconsistent, that they are based on the direct
    observations of the witness, and that they are not the result
    of police coercion or threats of prosecution. People v.
    Bastardo, 191 Colo. 521, 554 P.2d 297 (1976).</P>
    <P>
    <B>Court erred in denying defendant's request to admit
    testimony regarding prior inconsistent statements made by the
    victim.</B>The foundational requirements of this section were
    met because the victim remained available to testify and the
    inconsistent statements related to matters within her
    knowledge. The error was harmless since other admitted evidence
    questioned the victim's credibility. People v. Komar, 2015 COA
    171M, 411 P.3d 978.</P>
    <P>
    <B>Trial court did not err in not holding a hearing, sua
    sponte, on issue of whether informant's consent to electronic
    monitoring was obtained by coercion where</B>the trial court
    held it was not satisfied that the government or law
    enforcement authorities coerced the informant in any way and
    that finding was made with ample support. People v. Moltrer,
    893 P.2d 1331 (Colo. App. 1994).</P>
    <P>
    <B>Trial court did not err in applying the provisions of this
    section to summaries of electronically monitored conversations
    where</B>informant was explicitly advised that she could be
    recalled to testify and yet she persisted in her testimony that
    she remembered nothing of the transaction, the statement
    purported to be a matter within the informant's own knowledge,
    and she was available for cross-examination. People v. Moltrer,
    893 P.2d 1331 (Colo. App. 1994).</P>
    <P>
    <B>Application of this section in allowing prosecution to
    impeach its own witness</B>with prior inconsistent statements
    was not a violation of right to confront accuser, to assistance
    of counsel, to appear when depositions against one were taken,
    or to due process of law. People v. Bastardo, 191 Colo. 521,
    554 P.2d 297 (1976).</P>
    <P>
    <B>Court did not abuse discretion in excluding videotape of
    grandmother's testimony</B>where grandmother was confronted
    with inconsistent statements and she either explained the
    statements or conceded to the prior inconsistent statements on
    cross-examination. People v. Salas, 2017 COA 63, 405 P.3d

    <B>Purpose of section.</B>This section was intended to prevent

    <B>This section does not apply to rulings of court during

    <P>Technical errors are not grounds for reversal where verdict
    and judgment are correct. Koontz v. People, 82 Colo. 589, 263
    P. 19 (1927).</P>
    <P>The general assembly repeatedly has endeavored to make it
    plain that, in both civil and criminal procedure, substance,

    <P>Where error, if any committed, was harmless and did not tend
    to prejudice the substantial rights of the defendants on the

    <P>Misnomer of juror, manifest at the reception of the verdict

    <P>

    <B>Or where an indictment carries an erroneous allegation which

    not prejudicial to the defendant nor material to the merits of
    the case whether the deceased's true name was as set forth in
    the information or was Lila Lolly Downey and under the
    provisions of this section it was not error to refuse to give
    an instruction relating to the variance. Downey v. People, 121

    purported drawer, the named payee, the date, and the drawee
    bank as such appeared in the proffered check are all accurately
    described in the information, the slight variance obviously

    allegation of corporate entity, nor prejudiced by failure of
    the prosecution to prove it; he is fully protected against
    prosecution for the same offense, and his substantial rights

    established that the check was not duly signed by an officer of
    the corporation, but was in fact a forgery, which offense
    defendant was not charged with. Hence the motion for a directed
    verdict of not guilty at the conclusion of the people's case
    should have been sustained. Burns v. People, 145 Colo. 559, 360

  <CATCH-LINE>
  <RHFTO>16-10-301</RHFTO>.
  <M>Evidence of similar transactions - legislative
  declaration.</M></CATCH-LINE>(1)
  <M>The general assembly hereby finds and declares that sexual
  offenses are a matter of grave statewide concern. These
  frequently occurring offenses are aggressive and assaultive
  violations of the well-being, privacy, and security of the
  victims, are severely contrary to common notions of proper
  behavior between people, and result in serious and long-lasting
  harm to individuals and society. These offenses often are not
  reported or are reported long after the offense for many reasons,
  including: The frequency with which the victims are vulnerable,
  such as young children who may be related to the perpetrator; the
  personal indignity, humiliation, and embarrassment involved in
  the offenses themselves; and the fear of further personal
  indignity, humiliation, and embarrassment in connection with
  investigation and prosecution. These offenses usually occur under
  circumstances in which there are no witnesses except for the
  accused and the victim, and, because of this and the frequent
  delays in reporting, there is often no evidence except for the
  conflicting testimony. Moreover, there is frequently a reluctance
  on the part of others to believe that the offenses occurred
  because of the inequality between the victim and the perpetrator,
  such as between the child victim and the adult accused, or
  because of the deviant and distasteful nature of the charges. In
  addition, it is recognized that some sex offenders cannot or will
  not respond to treatment or otherwise resist the impulses which
  motivate such conduct and that sex offenders are extremely
  habituated. As a result, such offenders often commit numerous
  offenses involving sexual deviance over many years, with the same
  or different victims, and often, but not necessarily, through
  similar methods or by common design. The general assembly
  reaffirms and reemphasizes that, in the prosecution of sexual
  offenses, including in proving the corpus delicti of such
  offenses, there is a greater need and propriety for consideration
  by the fact finder of evidence of other relevant acts of the
  accused, including any actions, crimes, wrongs, or transactions,
  whether isolated acts or ongoing actions and whether occurring
  prior to or after the charged offense. The general assembly finds
  that such evidence of other sexual acts is typically relevant and
  highly probative, and it is expected that normally the probative
  value of such evidence will outweigh any danger of unfair
  prejudice, even when incidents are remote from one another in
  time.</M>
  <P N="(2)">(2)
  <M>This section applies to prosecution for any offense involving
  unlawful sexual behavior as defined in section 16-22-102 (9), or
  first degree murder, as defined in section 18-3-102 (1)(d),
  C.R.S., in which the underlying felony on which the first degree
  murder charge is based is the commission or attempted commission
  of sexual assault, as described in section 18-3-402, C.R.S.,
  sexual assault in the first or second degree as those offenses
  were described in sections 18-3-402 and 18-3-403, C.R.S., as they

  <P N="(3)">(3)
  <M>The prosecution may introduce evidence of other acts of the
  defendant to prove the commission of the offense as charged for
  any purpose other than propensity, including: Refuting defenses,
  such as consent or recent fabrication; showing a common plan,
  scheme, design, or modus operandi, regardless of whether identity
  is at issue and regardless of whether the charged offense has a
  close nexus as part of a unified transaction to the other act;
  showing motive, opportunity, intent, preparation, including
  grooming of a victim, knowledge, identity, or absence of mistake
  or accident; or for any other matter for which it is relevant.
  The prosecution may use such evidence either as proof in its case
  in chief or in rebuttal, including in response to evidence of the
  defendant's good character.</M></P>

  connotation.</M></P>
  <P N="(5)">(5)
  <M>The procedural requirements of this section shall not apply

    <B>Section not circumscribed by statute of limitation.</B>This
    section establishes the criteria for admission of testimony
    relating to similar acts and should not be circumscribed by a
    statute of limitation on sexual offenses. Adrian v. People, 770
    P.2d 1243 (Colo. 1989) (overruling Bigcraft v. People, 70 P.

    <B>Guilt of one offense may not be proven by guilt of

    is guilty of another. People v. Martin, 43 Colo. App. 44, 602
    P.2d 873 (1979).</P>
    <P>
    <B>"Acts or transactions" need not be criminal in
    nature.</B>Subsection (1) refers to "acts or transactions", not
    to offenses or crimes, and thus permits admission of evidence
    of events, not necessarily criminal in nature, for the limited
    purposes specified. People v. Opson, 632 P.2d 602 (Colo. App.

    <P>
    <B>Admissibility of prior criminal transactions
    discretionary.</B>The trial court has substantial discretion in
    deciding the admissibility of evidence of a prior criminal
    transaction, and only where there is an abuse of discretion

    <P>
    <B>Evidence of prior criminal transactions not admissible where
    defendant was acquitted of similar act.</B>The doctrine of
    collateral estoppel prevents the introduction of evidence of
    similar transactions for which a defendant has been acquitted.
    People v. Arrington, 682 P.2d 490 (Colo. App. 1983).</P>
    <P>
    <B>Collateral estoppel does not bar the introduction of prior
    act evidence relating to charges of which defendant was
    previously acquitted</B>when it is presented in a subsequent

    <P>
    <B>Evidence admissible that defendant did not commit other
    similar act.</B>If all the similar acts and circumstances,
    taken together, may support a finding that the same person was
    probably involved in both transactions, then evidence that the
    defendant did not commit the second transaction is relevant and
    admissible. People v. Flowers, 644 P.2d 916 (Colo. 1982),

    <B>Exclusionary rule inapplicable when defendant offers similar
    offense evidence.</B>When a defendant offers similar offense
    evidence for defensive reasons, the concerns which gave rise
    initially to the exclusionary rule are no longer relevant.
    People v. Flowers, 644 P.2d 916 (Colo. 1982), appeal dismissed

    <P>
    <B>Evidence of prior similar episodes is proper in sexual
    assault cases,</B>regardless of whether the evidence of similar
    episodes relates to acts with persons other than the
    complaining witness and even if a prima facie case of the
    defendant's intent is first established. People v. Pigford, 40

    264 (1979).</P>
    <P>Evidence of prior similar transactions is admissible to
    prove, among other things, plan, scheme, design, and motive,

    <P>
    <B>Length of time between two acts.</B>In addition to the
    degree of similarity between the earlier act and the act in
    question and the relevance of the similar act, the trial court
    should consider the length of time between the two acts when
    deciding whether to admit evidence of a similar sexual offense.
    An offense committed six years earlier is somewhat remote in
    time and, considered in light of all the other evidence, would
    be unduly prejudicial if admitted. People v. Wells, 754 P.2d
    420 (Colo. App. 1987), rev'd on other grounds, 776 P.2d 386
    (Colo. 1989).</P>
    <P>Considering the circumstances, prior incidents of sexual
    abuse were not too remote when there was interval of ten to
    twelve years between the childhood abuse and the charges for
    which the defendant was being charged. The defendant and the
    victim's mother were divorced during that period and the
    defendant had had no contact with the victim for four years and
    only limited contact with her thereafter. People v. Fell, 832
    P.2d 1015 (Colo. App. 1991).</P>
    <P>There are few absolute rules on the number of years that can
    separate two instances of conduct without destroying the
    evidentiary value of one. People v. Adrian, 744 P.2d 768 (Colo.
    App. 1987), aff'd, 770 P.2d 1243 (Colo. 1989); People v. Fell,
    832 P.2d 1015 (Colo. App. 1991).</P>
    <P>
    <B>Offenses committed approximately ten to twelve years earlier
    are not too remote in time</B>where the defendant and victim's
    mother were divorced and the defendant had had no contact with
    the victim for four years and only limited contact with her
    thereafter. Therefore, the prior incidents of sexual abuse were
    not too remote in time, and, consequently, no undue prejudice
    to defendant resulted from their admission. People v. Fell, 832
    P.2d 1015 (Colo. App. 1991).</P>
    <P>The general assembly has expressed a policy of favoring the
    admission of other acts evidence even when the incidents are
    remote from one another in time. People v. Shores, 2016 COA
    129, 412 P.3d 894.</P>
    <P>
    <B>Evidence of prior similar transactions is admissible</B>in
    cases of sexual assault on a child if such evidence is offered
    to show a common plan, scheme, design, identity, modus
    operandi, motive, guilty knowledge, or intent. People v.
    Adrian, 744 P.2d 768 (Colo. App. 1987), aff'd, 770 P.2d 1243
    (Colo. 1989); People v. Snyder, 874 P.2d 1076 (Colo. 1994);
    People v. Nara, 964 P.2d 578 (Colo. App. 1998) (decided under
    law in effect prior to the 1996 repeal and reenactment).</P>
    <P>The testimony regarding prior similar acts by four witnesses
    was logically relevant to defendant's identity and intent,
    apart from any inference of propensity, thus trial court did
    not abuse its discretion in admitting it. People v. Larson, 97
    P.3d 246 (Colo. App. 2004).</P>
    <P>Trial court did not abuse discretion in admitting evidence
    of prior incident of sexual assault on a child where incident
    had occurred eight years earlier, the evidence was introduced
    only to prove identity, and the jury was instructed that
    identity was the only purpose for which the evidence could be
    considered. People v. Apodaca, 58 P.3d 1126 (Colo. App.
    2002).</P>
    <P>
    <B>To refute the defense of recent fabrication,</B>evidence of
    prior similar transactions is admissible in cases of sexual
    assault on a child. People v. Duncan, 33 P.3d 1180 (Colo. App.
    2001).</P>
    <P>
    <B>To be admissible, the prior act evidence must</B>relate to a
    material fact, be logically relevant, and be independent of the
    intermediate inference of bad character and its probative value
    must outweigh the danger of unfair prejudice. People v. Wallen,
    996 P.2d 182 (Colo. App. 1999).</P>
    <P>
    <B>This section, as reenacted in 1996, contains no language
    that erodes those requirements or the requirement that the
    defendant engaged in the prior act.</B>Even when evidence of
    prior similar transactions is introduced in prosecutions
    specifically mentioned in this section, an analysis under
    C.R.E. 404(b) is still necessary. People v. Martinez, 36 P.3d
    154 (Colo. App. 2001).</P>
    <P>
    <B>While it is error for the trial court to rule that this
    section supercedes previous authority regarding the
    admissibility of prior similar transactions
    evidence,</B>reversal is not required if the record supports
    the court's admission of such evidence under the appropriate
    standard. People v. Martinez, 36 P.3d 154 (Colo. App.

    more likely defendant committed the crimes. Defendant's claim
    that he would have testified in one case, but not the other,
    making joinder improper did not rise to the level of prejudice.
    Defendant was still able to show the jury a police interview in

    <B>Trial court did not abuse its discretion in admitting

    logically relevant to defendant's identity and intent, apart

    evidence was not substantially outweighed by the danger of
    unfair prejudice; and the court gave detailed instructions to
    the jury multiple times that articulated the proper use of the
    evidence. People v. Larson, 97 P.3d 246 (Colo. App. 2004).</P>
    <P>
    <B>Court properly admitted previous incident evidence based on

    <P>As a result of the interplay of § 13-25-129 and this section

  <M>If the defendant is assessed any fines, fees, costs,
  surcharges, or other monetary assessments with regard to the
  sentencing or other disposition of a felony, misdemeanor, petty
  offense, civil infraction, traffic offense, or traffic infraction
  and does not pay all amounts assessed in full on the date of the
  assessment, the defendant shall pay to the clerk of the court an
  additional time payment fee of twenty-five dollars. The time
  payment fee may be assessed once per case; except that, if
  amounts owed in the case have still not been paid in full one
  year after the date of the assessment, the fee may be assessed
  annually until the defendant has fully satisfied his or her
  financial obligation in the case. In addition, there may be
  assessed against a defendant a late penalty fee of ten dollars
  each time a payment toward the fines, fees, costs, surcharges, or
  other amounts owed is not received on or before the date due. If
  the court determines that the defendant does not have the
  financial resources to pay a time payment fee or a late penalty
  fee, the court may waive or suspend a time payment fee or a late
  penalty fee. Amounts collected are credited first against the
  time payment and any late penalty fees assessed under this
  subsection (1), then against any fines, and finally against any
  costs. The time payment fee and late penalty fee described in
  this subsection (1) do not apply to a person under the
  jurisdiction of the juvenile court or the person's parent,
  guardian, or legal custodian.</M>
  <P N="(2)">(2)
  <M>All time payment fees and late penalty fees collected shall be
  credited to the judicial collection enhancement fund, which fund
  is hereby created in the state treasury. In addition, reasonable
  costs incurred and collected by the state shall be credited to
  the fund. The general assembly shall make annual appropriations
  from the fund to the judicial department for administrative and
  personnel costs incurred in collecting restitution, fines, costs,
  fees, and other monetary assessments. At the end of any fiscal
  year, all unexpended and unencumbered moneys and any interest
  shall remain in the fund for appropriation to the judicial
  department for ongoing enforcement and collection of restitution,
  fines, fees, costs, surcharges, and other monetary
  assessments.</M></P>
  <P N="(3)">(3)
  <M>To collect on past due orders of fines or fees, the state may
  employ any method available to collect state receivables,
  including assigning such accounts to private counsel or private
  collection agencies under section 24-30-202.4 (2), C.R.S. Any
  fees or costs of the private counsel or collection agency shall
  also be added to the amount due, but such fees and costs shall
  not exceed twenty-five percent of the amount collected.</M></P>

  certain portion of a defendant's earnings, not to exceed fifty
  percent, be withheld and applied to any unpaid fines or fees, if
  such an order does not adversely impact the defendant's ability
  to comply with other orders of the court. An attachment of
  earnings under this section may be modified to a lesser or
  greater amount based upon changes in a defendant's circumstances
  as long as the amount withheld does not exceed fifty percent and
  may be suspended or canceled at the court's discretion. For
  purposes of this section, "earnings" shall have the same meaning

  fines and fees and may direct that a portion of the wages of such
  defendant under section 17-24-122 (3), C.R.S., or compensation

  of offsetting against a claim for unclaimed property the amount
  of outstanding fines, fees, costs, or surcharges owed pursuant to
  law or an order entered by a court of this state by the person
  claiming unclaimed property. When an offset is to be made, the
  judicial department or the court to which the fines, fees, costs,

  purpose of conducting a data match and offsetting the obligation
  against a state income tax refund pursuant to section 39-21-108
  (3) or lottery winnings pursuant to section 44-40-114. For any
  obligation identified by the judicial department for offset, the
  state court administrator shall:</M>
  <P N="(1)(a)">(a)
  <M>On at least an annual basis, certify to the department of
  revenue the social security number of the defendant who is
  obligated to pay the obligation and the amount of the outstanding
  obligation. The department of revenue may request additional
  identifying information from the judicial department that is
  necessary to obtain an accurate data match.</M></P>
  <P N="(1)(b)">(b)
  <M>Upon notification by the department of revenue of a data
  match, notify the appropriate court that a match has occurred and
  that an offset is pending and provide to the court the
  identifying information received from the department concerning

  <P N="(1)(d)">(d)
  <M>Upon receipt of funds for offset from the department of

  <P N="(2)">(2)
  <M>The clerk of court shall apply funds received pursuant to this
  section to the defendant's outstanding fines, fees, costs, or

  obligations the defendant owes the court or the judicial
  department. If no other financial obligations are owed, the clerk
  of court shall refund any excess moneys to the defendant.</M></P>
  <P N="(3)">(3)
  <M>The state court administrator may adopt rules establishing the
  process by which a defendant may object to an offset and request
  an administrative review. The sole issues to be determined at the
  administrative review shall be whether the person is required to
  pay the fines, fees, costs, or surcharges pursuant to law or an
  order entered by a court of this state and the amount of the
  outstanding fines, fees, costs, or surcharges.</M></P>
  <P N="(4)">(4)

    <B>No right to evidentiary hearing.</B>During a discretionary

    presentence report. People v. Padilla, 907 P.2d 601 (Colo.
    1995).</P>

    <B>Duration of period of probation is limited to maximum term

    the provision of § 16-11-202 permitting the court to grant
    probation "for such a period and upon such terms and conditions
    as it deems best", does not give the court the authority to
    extend the terms of probation beyond the maximum term of
    imprisonment. People v. Knaub, 624 P.2d 922 (Colo. App.

    <P>This section designates in what cases and circumstances an
    officer must make a presentence investigation and report. Logan
    v. People ex rel. Alamosa County, 138 Colo. 304, 332 P.2d 897
    (1958).</P>
    <P>
    <B>Written report required.</B>This section requires that,
    after conviction of crime, an investigation is to be made by a
    probation officer who shall make a written report to the court
    containing his findings on matters bearing upon the sentence to
    be imposed. Williams v. People, 134 Colo. 580, 307 P.2d 466
    (1957).</P>
    <P>Trial court erred by proceeding to sentencing without a
    presentence investigation report ("PSIR"). The plain language
    of this section requires the preparation of a PSIR before
    sentencing, unless both the defendant and the prosecution agree
    to proceed to sentencing without the benefit of such a report.
    Here, the prosecution specifically requested that a PSIR be
    prepared, and objected to the court's proceeding to sentencing
    without one. The prosecution thus did not waive the statutory
    requirement that the PSIR be prepared before the imposition of
    sentence. People v. Gretz, 973 P.2d 110 (Colo. App. 1998).</P>
    <P>When an application for probation is made by an eligible
    person, a district court is required to cause a probation
    officer to make an investigation of the applicant. The
    probation officer within such time as the court may prescribe
    shall make a written report to the court of said investigation,
    together with his recommendation as to whether or not probation
    should be granted. Logan v. People ex rel. Alamosa, 138 Colo.
    304, 332 P.2d 897 (1958).</P>
    <P>
    <B>Which may contain any information helpful to courts.</B>The
    trial court, before granting or denying an application for
    probation and before imposing sentence, is to be advised by a
    written report from the probation officer of any prior criminal
    record of the defendant and of such information about his
    characteristics, his financial condition, and circumstances
    affecting his behavior, and any other information as may be
    required by the court, as may be helpful in determining the
    advisability of granting probation, or as may be helpful in
    imposing sentence in the event probation is denied. Wolford v.
    People, 178 Colo. 203, 496 P.2d 1011 (1972).</P>
    <P>
    <B>Evidence is not limited by strict rules or due
    process.</B>This section does not contemplate that the
    probation officer is required to establish the matters reported
    in the probation report by evidence presented in accordance
    with the due process procedures required of a guilt trial, nor
    are strict rules of evidence adhered to. Wolford v. People, 178
    Colo. 203, 496 P.2d 1011 (1972).</P>
    <P>
    <B>The defendant has the right to be heard</B>concerning
    matters in the report which he believes to be inaccurate or
    untrue. Wolford v. People, 178 Colo. 203, 496 P.2d 1011
    (1972).</P>
    <P>
    <B>Unless shown to be untrue, court may rely on report.</B>When
    represented by competent counsel and supplied with a copy of
    the probation report, defendant does not show that the
    information supplied to the court in the probation report was
    inaccurate or untrue, a court is entitled to rely upon the
    report as submitted. Wolford v. People, 178 Colo. 203, 496 P.2d
    1011 (1972).</P>
    <P>
    <B>If defendant fails to show inaccuracy of information</B>in
    presentence report or victim impact statement, including
    restitution amount, at sentencing hearing, he waives the right
    to contest the information. People v. Powell, 748 P.2d 1355
    (Colo. App. 1987).</P>
    <P>
    <B>Remand for presentation of evidence in rebuttal to
    report.</B>Where the presentence report is issued to counsel
    immediately prior to sentencing, and the trial court's refusal
    to continue the sentencing hearing to another day unduly
    abridges the defendant's rights to present evidence in rebuttal
    to the information and recommendations contained in the report,
    his sentence must be vacated and the case remanded for
    resentencing after a full sentencing hearing. People v. Wright,
    672 P.2d 518 (Colo. 1983).</P>
    <P>
    <B>Court erred in relying for sentencing purposes upon
    information and evidence not included within the presentence
    report</B>or disclosed to defendant by some other means prior
    to the sentencing hearing. People v. Pourat, 100 P.3d 503
    (Colo. App. 2004).</P>
    <P>
    <B>Error by the court to proceed to sentencing defendant
    without report was harmless</B>where defendant refused to be
    interviewed by probation officer, neither defense counsel nor
    prosecutor objected to proceeding without report, defense
    counsel submitted memorandum that was functional equivalent of
    presentence report, and defendant failed to allege on appeal
    how he was prejudiced by absence of report. People v. Martinez,
    32 P.3d 520 (Colo. App. 2001).</P>
    <P>
    <B>Recommendations as to sentences are made by probation
    officers only upon request by the court.</B>Smith v. People,
    162 Colo. 558, 428 P.2d 69 (1967).</P>
    <P>
    <B>The totality of discretion rests with the trial court in the
    imposition of sentence.</B>A recommendation by the probation
    officer is nothing more nor less than a recommendation. Smith
    v. People, 162 Colo. 558, 428 P.2d 69 (1967).</P>
    <P>
    <B>Provision is made for a mental and physical examination of
    an applicant for probation.</B>Logan v. People ex rel. Alamosa
    County, 138 Colo. 304, 332 P.2d 897 (1958).</P>
    <P>
    <B>Trial court could impose restitution under this section and
    § 17-2-201 as a condition of parole,</B>even though the
    restitution provisions of § 16-11-204.5 did not apply since the
    defendant pleaded guilty to theft by receiving and was not
    sentenced to probation. People v. Schmidt, 700 P.2d 925 (Colo.
    App. 1985).</P>
    <P>
    <B>Sentence of incarceration precludes order of
    restitution,</B>but at time of sentencing, court may set amount
    of restitution for later consideration by parole board when
    board sets conditions for parole under § 17-2-201. People v.
    Powell, 748 P.2d 1355 (Colo. App. 1987).</P>
    <P>
    <B>This section does not authorize the court to impose
    restitution</B>unless authorized pursuant to another statutory
    provision. People v. Young, 710 P.2d 1140 (Colo. App. 1985)
    (decided prior to 1996 amendment to subsection (4)).</P>
    <P>
    <B>Subsection (4), as amended in 1996, requires courts to
    impose restitution at the time of sentencing,</B>even where a
    defendant is sentenced to incarceration. People v. Tipton, 973
    P.2d 713 (Colo. App. 1998); People v. Apodaca, 998 P.2d 25
    (Colo. App. 1999).</P>
    <P>
    <B>When an offense requires proof of the identity of a
    particular victim, the court may not order restitution to
    another.</B>Defendant who pled guilty to a single count of
    theft in return for a dismissal of other counts may not be
    ordered to pay restitution to the victims in the counts that
    were dismissed. People v. Armijo, 989 P.2d 224 (Colo. App.
    1999).</P>
    <P>
    <B>A codefendant is jointly responsible for restitution</B>when
    he is also a complicitor in the crime. People v. Fichtner, 869
    P.2d 539 (Colo. 1994).</P>
    <P>
    <B>Codefendants were participants and complicitors in the same
    criminal acts,</B>therefore, each is responsible for the damage
    he caused and also for the damage caused by the other. People
    v. Fichtner, 869 P.2d 539 (Colo. 1994).</P>
    <P>
    <B>The sentencing court is required to fix the defendant's
    criminal liability for restitution</B>by considering the
    victim's actual monetary losses and, where appropriate, to
    temper the defendant's restitution obligation by considering
    his financial ability to pay and his duty of support owed to
    his dependents and any other outstanding family
    responsibilities. The statutory scheme, in other words, does
    not require the sentencing court to determine a defendant's
    criminal liability for restitution in accordance with the
    strict rules of damages applicable to a civil case. People v.
    Johnson, 780 P.2d 504 (Colo. 1989); People v. Duran, 991 P.2d
    313 (Colo. App. 1999).</P>
    <P>
    <B>An order of restitution becomes part of the
    sentence</B>which, in accordance with Crim. P. 32(c), is part
    of the judgment of conviction. When a court orders a defendant,
    over his objection, to pay restitution to the victim or the
    victim's family as part of the judgment of conviction for a
    felony, the order of restitution is appealable pursuant to the
    statutory procedures applicable to the appellate review of a
    felony sentence. People v. Johnson, 780 P.2d 504 (Colo.
    1989).</P>
    <P>
    <B>An order increasing the amount of restitution has the effect
    of increasing the punishment originally imposed.</B>Therefore,
    because restitution is a part of the criminal sentence, once a
    legal sentence is imposed and a defendant has begun serving it,
    an increase in the amount of restitution ordered also violates
    the constitutional prohibition against double jeopardy. People
    v. Shepard, 989 P.2d 183 (Colo. App. 1999).</P>
    <P>
    <B>Statute provides no right to offender to present evidence of
    ability to pay restitution during revocation hearing</B>when
    hearing is based on other grounds. People v. McCarty, 851 P.2d
    181 (Colo. App. 1992).</P>
    <P>
    <B>Order requiring defendant to pay restitution for one-half of
    the value of property missing from the truck involved in
    defendant's conviction for theft by receiving was
    improper.</B>There was no evidence linking the defendant's
    conduct of theft by receiving the stolen truck and the missing
    personal property from the truck. The trial court's order,
    based on speculation, was improper. People v. Randolph, 852
    P.2d 1282 (Colo. App. 1992).</P>
    <P>
    <B>Although a trial court may establish restitution pursuant to
    this section,</B>it may not establish the method of payment for
    restitution. People v. Randolph, 852 P.2d 1282 (Colo. App.
    1992); People v. Strock, 931 P.2d 538 (Colo. App. 1996).</P>
    <P>The manner and time of payment of restitution is exclusively
    within the jurisdiction of the parole board. People v. Strock,
    931 P.2d 538 (Colo. App. 1996).</P>
    <P>
    <B>The general assembly did not intend to give absolute
    discretion to a court</B>to comply or not to comply with what
    appear to be mandatory requirements of a presentence report.
    People v. Valencia, 888 P.2d 319 (Colo. App. 1994), aff'd, 906
    P.2d 115 (Colo. 1995).</P>
    <P>
    <B>The record of the sentencing hearing must include at least a
    summary of the information relied upon by the sentencing court
    but not contained in the presentence report.</B>Absent such a
    record, no meaningful appellate review of the sentence is
    possible. People v. Pourat, 100 P.3d 503 (Colo. App. 2004).</P>
    <P>
    <B>Because the trial court did not set forth any reasons for
    its waiver of statutory requirements,</B>the defendant's
    presentence report did not comport with the requirements of
    this section. People v. Valencia, 888 P.2d 319 (Colo. App.
    1994).</P>
    <P>
    <B>Prior to sentencing, the court must grant the defendant an
    opportunity to make a statement on his or her own
    behalf.</B>The proper remedy for failing to allow the defendant
    to make a statement is resentencing. People v. Marquantte, 923
    P.2d 180 (Colo. App. 1995); People v. Perea, 74 P.3d 326 (Colo.
    App. 2002).</P>
    <P>
    <B>Failure to afford defendant an opportunity to speak amounts
    to plain error where the court did not directly address the
    defendant or personally invite him to speak.</B>The court's
    inquiry whether "other people in the court" wanted to speak was
    clearly directed to the nonparties in attendance, not to the
    defendant. People v. Smalley, 2015 COA 140, 369 P.3d 737.</P>
    <P>
    <B>However, the right of allocution is a statutory right, not a
    constitutional one, and reversal is not required if the failure
    to provide the defendant an opportunity to make a statement
    prior to sentencing is harmless.</B>If a trial court imposes
    the minimum sentence permitted and does not have discretion to
    impose a lesser sentence, the lack of a statement in allocution
    does not affect the sentence and is harmless. People v.
    Martinez, 83 P.3d 1174 (Colo. App. 2003).</P>
    <P>
    <B>Defendant's right of allocution was not improperly
    withheld</B>where court asked defense counsel if defendant
    wished to make a statement to the court, but counsel proceeded
    to argument. People v. Loyd, 902 P.2d 889 (Colo. App.
    1995).</P>
    <P>
    <B>When the court dispenses with the presentence report,</B>the
    probation department, within seventy-two hours prior to the
    sentencing hearing, should provide the prosecuting attorney and
    defense counsel, or the defendant if unrepresented, with a copy
    of the victim impact statement setting forth the amount of the
    victim's claimed monetary damages and the amount of restitution
    for which the defendant may be responsible. At the sentencing
    hearing the defendant must be given the opportunity to
    controvert the victim's claimed monetary damages. People v.
    Johnson, 780 P.2d 504 (Colo. 1989).</P>
    <P>
    <B>"Victim" construed.</B>The transfer of stolen property to a
    bona fide purchaser necessarily victimizes the purchaser since
    his interests must yield to the title of the rightful owner.
    Therefore, the bona fide purchaser of stolen property was a
    victim for purposes of ordering restitution and the trial court
    properly included in the amount of restitution an amount to
    reimburse the purchaser, an antique dealer, for expenses for
    restoration of the property. People v. Schmidt, 700 P.2d 925
    (Colo. App. 1985).</P>

    <B>Clear purpose of § 16-11-204 (3) is to provide criminal
    defendant with notice of terms</B>of his probation. People v.
    Zimmerman, 616 P.2d 997 (Colo. App. 1980). 
    <P>
    <B>But failure to comply with § 16-11-204 (3) did not require
    reversal of revocation.</B>People v. Zimmerman, 616 P.2d 997
    (Colo. App. 1980).</P>
    <P>
    <B>Defendant presumed to know that violation may result in
    revocation.</B>Probation is a privilege, and a criminal
    defendant is presumed to know that the violation of any term of
    his probation may result in revocation. People v. Zimmerman,
    616 P.2d 997 (Colo. App. 1980).</P>
    <P>
    <B>Subsection (4) limitation inapplicable to deferred sentence
    revocation proceeding.</B>Since the five-day limitation
    specified in subsection (4) is not a procedural safeguard
    required in a probation revocation hearing pursuant to §
    16-11-206, but rather is a prehearing requirement imposed on
    the probation officer, it is not within the contemplation of §
    16-7-403 (2). People v. Schoonover, 654 P.2d 1340 (Colo. App.
    1982).</P>
    <P>
    <B>Application for entry of deferred judgment and imposition of
    sentence was sufficient to notify</B>defendant of the
    violations he was alleged to have committed. People v. Allen,
    952 P.2d 764 (Colo. App. 1997), rev'd on other grounds, 973
    P.2d 620 (Colo. 1999).</P>
    <P>
    <B>Subsection (3) did not apply</B>to actions of district
    attorney. People v. McPherson, 897 P.2d 923 (Colo. App.
    1995).</P>
    <P>
    <B>It would be exalting form over substance</B>for the court to
    hold that a probation term was not tolled by the filing of a
    complaint in support of issuance of an arrest warrant to
    initiate revocation of probation proceedings. People v. Galvin,
    961 P.2d 1137 (Colo. App. 1997).</P>
    <P>To toll the probation period until probation revocation
    proceedings are completed, it is sufficient that: (1) A
    probation officer issue a summons requiring the probationer to
    appear in court; (2) a probation officer arrest the
    probationer; (3) a complaint be filed for the revocation of
    probation; or (4) a report be filed by a probation officer or a
    verified complaint by any person, together with a request for
    an arrest warrant. People v. Galvin, 961 P.2d 1137 (Colo. App.
    1997).</P>
    <P>
    <B>Probation is a privilege, not a right.</B>Whether a
    probationer has violated a probation condition presents a
    question of fact. Once the court finds that a violation has
    occurred, whether probation should be revoked lies within the
    discretion of the court. People v. Ickler, 877 P.2d 863 (Colo.
    1994); People v. Colabello, 948 P.2d 77 (Colo. App. 1997);
    People v. Howell, 64 P.3d 894 (Colo. App. 2002).</P>
    <P>
    <B>Parole revocation order must be reversed because defendant
    did not receive written notice of the condition of probation
    that he was alleged to have violated.</B>People v. Calderon,
    2014 COA 144, 356 P.3d 993.</P>
    <P>
    <B>Subsection (5) does not specify particular format for
    complaint alleging violation of probation.</B>The
    constitutional sufficiency of notice to a probationer that is
    written, but provided in an irregular format, should be
    measured by whether the notice sufficiently fulfilled the
    central function of informing the probationer of the alleged
    basis for revocation. The original revocation complaint served
    on the probationer did not specify that the revocation was
    based upon conviction for a murder the probationer committed
    while on probation, but instead included the original charges
    filed. The probationer received constitutionally sufficient
    written notice, however, in a motion to continue the revocation
    hearing that explicitly identified the murder conviction as a
    ground for revocation. People v. Robles, 209 P.3d 1173 (Colo.
    App. 2009).</P>
    <P>
    <B>Applied</B>in Adair v. People, 651 P.2d 389 (Colo. 1982);

  <M>Revocation hearing.</M></CATCH-LINE>(1)
  <M>At the first appearance of the probationer in court or at the
  commencement of the hearing, whichever is first in time, the
  court shall advise the probationer as provided in section
  16-7-207 insofar as such matters are applicable; except that
  there is no right to a trial by jury in proceedings for
  revocation of probation.</M>
  <P N="(2)">(2)
  <M>At or prior to the commencement of the hearing, the court
  shall advise the probationer of the charges against him and the
  possible penalties therefor and shall require the probationer to
  plead guilty or not guilty.</M></P>
  <P N="(3)">(3)
  <M>At the hearing, the prosecution has the burden of establishing
  by a preponderance of the evidence the violation of a condition
  of probation; except that the commission of a criminal offense
  must be established beyond a reasonable doubt unless the
  probationer has been convicted thereof in a criminal proceeding.
  When, in a revocation hearing, the alleged violation of a
  condition is the probationer's failure to pay court-ordered
  compensation to appointed counsel, probation fees, court costs,
  restitution, or reparations, evidence of the failure to pay shall
  constitute prima facie evidence of a violation. The court may,
  when it appears that the alleged violation of conditions of
  probation consists of an offense with which the probationer is
  charged in a criminal proceeding then pending, continue the
  probation revocation hearing until the termination of the
  criminal proceeding. Any evidence having probative value shall be
  received regardless of its admissibility under the exclusionary
  rules of evidence if the defendant is accorded a fair opportunity
  to rebut hearsay evidence.</M></P>
  <P N="(4)">(4)
  <M>If the probationer is in custody, the hearing shall be held
  within fourteen days after the filing of the complaint, unless
  delay or continuance is granted by the court at the instance or
  request of the probationer or for other good cause found by the
  court justifying further delay.</M></P>
  <P N="(5)">(5)
  <M>If the court determines that a violation of a condition of
  probation has been committed, it shall, within seven days after
  the said hearing, either revoke or continue the probation. If
  probation is revoked, the court may then impose any sentence or
  grant any probation pursuant to the provisions of this part 2
  which might originally have been imposed or
  granted.</M></P></SECTION-TEXT>

  <ANNO-NOTE>
    <ANNO-TEXT>
    <B>Annotator's note.</B>Since § 16-11-206 is similar to
    repealed § 39-16-9, C.R.S. 1963, and § 39-16-9, CRS 53,
    relevant cases construing those provisions have been included
    in the annotations to this section. 
    <P>
    <B>Scope of probationer's constitutional rights.</B>Upon a
    probation revocation hearing the probationer is not entitled to
    claim the full range of constitutional guarantees available to
    one not yet convicted of a crime. Holdren v. People, 168 Colo.
    474, 452 P.2d 28 (1969); People v. Atencio, 186 Colo. 76, 525
    P.2d 461 (1974).</P>
    <P>While the defendant is entitled to certain procedural due
    process rights at a probation revocation hearing, he is not
    entitled to the full panoply of constitutional guarantees
    available to one who has not been convicted of a crime, and
    thus cannot complain of the admission of illegally seized
    evidence. People v. Wilkerson, 189 Colo. 448, 541 P.2d 896
    (1975).</P>
    <P>
    <B>The following "minimum requirements of due process" at
    parole or probation revocation hearings are required:</B>(1)
    Written notice of the claimed violations of probation; (2)
    disclosure to the probationer of evidence against him; (3)
    opportunity to be heard in person and to present witnesses and
    documentary evidence; (4) the right to confront and
    cross-examine adverse witnesses (unless the hearing officer
    specifically finds good cause for not allowing confrontation);
    (5) a "neutral and detached" hearing body such as a traditional
    parole board, members of which need not be judicial officers or
    lawyers; and (6) a written statement by the fact finders as to
    the evidence relied on and reasons for revoking probation.
    People v. Atencio, 186 Colo. 76, 525 P.2d 461 (1974); People v.
    Thomas, 42 Colo. App. 441, 599 P.2d 957 (1979).</P>
    <P>Prior to a probation revocation hearing, the probationer has
    a right to be informed of the specific probation violations
    with which he is charged. People v. Carr, 185 Colo. 293, 524
    P.2d 301 (1974).</P>
    <P>
    <B>Right to counsel applies to revocation
    hearings,</B>including effective assistance of counsel as
    tested by the standard set forth in Strickland v. Washington,
    466 U.S. 668 (1984). People v. Timoshchuk, 2018 COA 153, 457
    P.3d 684.</P>
    <P>
    <B>Nothing in this section or the state or federal
    constitutions requires the trial court to advise the defendant
    of his or her right to testify at a deferred judgment
    revocation proceeding.</B>People v. Allen, 973 P.2d 620 (Colo.
    1999).</P>
    <P>
    <B>Oral findings made by the fact finder on the record satisfy
    constitutional requirements of procedural due
    process,</B>including a written statement by the fact finder as
    to the evidence relied on and the reasons for revoking
    probation. People v. Elder, 36 P.3d 172 (Colo. App. 2001).</P>
    <P>
    <B>Defendant's privilege against self-incrimination precluded
    the court from revoking defendant's probation based on a
    refusal to answer</B>the polygraph examiner's question
    regarding viewing or using child pornography while on
    probation. People v. Roberson, 2016 CO 36, 377 P.3d 1039.</P>
    <P>
    <B>There is no fifth amendment violation when a trial court
    revokes a defendant's probation based on a total refusal to
    attend sex offender treatment.</B>Defendant prematurely invoked
    his fifth amendment right before actually being required to
    incriminate himself. People v. Ruch, 2016 CO 35, 379 P.3d
    309.</P>
    <P>
    <B>He has rights granted by general assembly.</B>Where there
    are no constitutional rights involved, the supreme court of the
    United States has stated that a probationer has only those
    rights granted to him by the general assembly. Gehl v. People,
    161 Colo. 535, 423 P.2d 332 (1967).</P>
    <P>
    <B>Clear purpose of § 16-11-204 (3) is to provide criminal
    defendant with notice of terms</B>of his probation. People v.
    Zimmerman, 616 P.2d 997 (Colo. App. 1980).</P>
    <P>
    <B>But failure to comply with § 16-11-204 (3) did not require
    reversal of revocation</B>in and of itself. People v.
    Zimmerman, 616 P.2d 997 (Colo. App. 1980).</P>
    <P>
    <B>Defendant presumed to know that violation may result in
    revocation.</B>Probation is a privilege, and a criminal
    defendant is presumed to know that the violation of any term of
    his probation may result in revocation. People v. Zimmerman,
    616 P.2d 997 (Colo. App. 1980).</P>
    <P>
    <B>Probation revocation proceedings involving deferred
    sentencing are quite distinct from parole revocation
    proceedings.</B>The statutes on probation do not provide
    probationers more in substance than what is accorded parolees.
    Martinez v. Patterson, 429 F.2d 844 (10th Cir. 1970), cert.
    denied, 402 US 934, 91 S. Ct. 1528, 28 L. Ed. 2d 868
    (1971).</P>
    <P>
    <B>For purposes of determining whether an order is final and
    appealable,</B>there is no appreciable difference between an
    order dismissing a petition to revoke probation and an order
    declining to revoke probation. Lewis v. People, 214 P.3d 1059
    (Colo. 2009).</P>
    <P>
    <B>The question of whether the probation shall be revoked is
    within the sound discretion of the judge.</B>Holdren v. People,
    168 Colo. 474, 452 P.2d 28 (1969); People v. Ickler, 877 P.2d
    863 (Colo. 1994); People v. Colabello, 948 P.2d 77 (Colo. App.
    1997); People v. Elder, 36 P.3d 172 (Colo. App. 2001).</P>
    <P>
    <B>Probation is a privilege, not a right.</B>Whether a
    probationer has violated a probation condition presents a
    question of fact. Once the court finds that a violation has
    occurred, whether probation should be revoked lies within the
    discretion of the court. People v. Ickler, 877 P.2d 863 (Colo.
    1994); People v. Colabello, 948 P.2d 77 (Colo. App. 1997);
    People v. Howell, 64 P.3d 894 (Colo. App. 2002).</P>
    <P>
    <B>It is better practice to continue a probation revocation
    hearing until after a trial on new charges,</B>but it lies
    within the discretion of the trial court. People v. Ray, 192
    Colo. 391, 560 P.2d 74 (1977).</P>
    <P>
    <B>Issue preclusion does not apply to bar the right of a
    defendant to a trial</B>where defendant had been charged with
    the crime of driving with a revoked license, which constituted
    both a violation of his probation and a new criminal act.
    Defendant did not have a full and fair opportunity to litigate
    the issue in the probation revocation hearing. A determination
    of guilt or innocence in a probation revocation hearing would
    undermine the function of the criminal trial process. Byrd v.
    People, 58 P.3d 50 (Colo. 2002).</P>
    <P>Probation revocation hearings are held for different
    purposes, governed by different procedures, and do not protect
    a defendant's rights as does a criminal trial. Byrd v. People,
    58 P.3d 50 (Colo. 2002).</P>
    <P>
    <B>Continuance of hearing not reversed absent abuse of
    discretion.</B>A finding of good cause for a continuance is
    within the discretion of the trial court and will not be
    reversed appeal absent an abuse of discretion. People v.
    Marrow, 638 P.2d 842 (Colo. App. 1981).</P>
    <P>
    <B>Abuse not found.</B>Where a court ordered a continuance in
    view of the late filing of an amended complaint against
    defendant and the defendant's need for additional time to
    respond to the allegations in the amended complaint, there was
    no abuse of discretion. People v. Marrow, 638 P.2d 842 (Colo.
    App. 1981).</P>
    <P>
    <B>What constitutes prejudice in denial of continuance at
    hearing.</B>When a continuance of a sentencing hearing for
    revocation of probation is denied, the trial court will not be
    held to have abused its discretion unless the defendant
    demonstrates prejudice resulting from the failure to continue.
    Where the defendant subsequently pleads guilty to the charge
    for which probation was revoked, he fails to establish
    prejudice. People v. Abila, 670 P.2d 432 (Colo. App. 1983).</P>
    <P>
    <B>This section ordains the procedure where a probationer
    violates the conditions of probation.</B>Logan v. People, 138
    Colo. 304, 332 P.2d 897 (1958).</P>
    <P>
    <B>It requires a hearing on a revocation of
    probation.</B>Holdren v. People, 168 Colo. 474, 452 P.2d 28
    (1969).</P>
    <P>
    <B>To read this section harmoniously with § 16-11-204, the
    proper standard of proof is a preponderance of the
    evidence</B>when it is alleged that a condition of probation
    has been breached, even though the breaching conduct also may
    have constituted a criminal offense. People v. Moses, 64 P.3d
    904 (Colo. App. 2002).</P>
    <P>
    <B>Burden of establishing violation.</B>Where an alleged
    violation of a condition of probation is a criminal offense,
    the prosecution has the burden of establishing the violation
    beyond a reasonable doubt. People v. Carr, 185 Colo. 293, 524
    P.2d 301 (1974).</P>
    <P>
    <B>Subsection (3) is based on a defendant's being subsequently
    convicted of a crime, not receiving a judgment of
    conviction.</B>People v. Blackwell, 2016 COA 136, 409 P.3d
    558.</P>
    <P>
    <B>Under subsection (3), once the prosecution shows that a
    defendant has not paid restitution, the burden shifts to the
    defendant</B>to show that he or she was unable to pay. People
    v. Roletto, 2015 COA 41, 370 P.3d 190.</P>
    <P>
    <B>Beyond reasonable doubt standard of proof.</B>An adult
    charged with a probation violation which constitutes a criminal
    offense has the right to demand that the people's charge that
    he committed the crime relied upon as a probation violation be
    proved "beyond a reasonable doubt". People in Interest of C.B.,
    196 Colo. 362, 585 P.2d 281 (1978); People v. Van Deusen, 677
    P.2d 402 (Colo. App. 1983).</P>
    <P>
    <B>Defendant's plea constitutes a conviction within the meaning
    of subsection (3).</B>Court does not have to find reasonable
    doubt that defendant violated the law because the court's
    acceptance of defendant's guilty plea amounted to a conviction
    and a violation of the terms of defendant's deferred judgment.
    People v. Blackwell, 2016 COA 136, 409 P.3d 558.</P>
    <P>
    <B>Presumption that court applied proper standard of
    proof.</B>Although the court did not articulate the standard of
    proof it applied in revoking probation, the court is entitled
    to a presumption that it applied the proper standard. People v.
    Carr, 185 Colo. 293, 524 P.2d 301 (1974).</P>
    <P>
    <B>Plea of not guilty by reason of insanity not allowed in
    probation revocation hearing.</B>A court, in permitting a plea
    of "not guilty by reason of insanity" in a probation revocation
    hearing, exceeds its jurisdiction, as a plea of not guilty by
    reason of insanity is not a proper means of testing competency
    at a probation revocation hearing. People ex rel. Gallagher v.
    District Court, 196 Colo. 499, 591 P.2d 1015 (1978).</P>
    <P>
    <B>Formal procedures and rules of evidence not employed.</B>One
    of the critical differences between criminal trials and
    probation revocation hearings is that formal procedures and
    rules of evidence are not employed. People v. Atencio, 186
    Colo. 76, 525 P.2d 461 (1974).</P>
    <P>
    <B>Hearing may be informally conducted.</B>Where a hearing to
    revoke probation is called for by statute, it may be informally
    conducted. Gehl v. People, 161 Colo. 535, 423 P.2d 332
    (1967).</P>
    <P>A hearing must be held on a petition to revoke probation.
    But the hearing may be informally conducted, and the court may
    take into consideration all factors normally taken into account
    during sentencing. Holdren v. People, 168 Colo. 474, 452 P.2d
    28 (1969).</P>
    <P>
    <B>Two-month delay in scheduling of hearing for probation
    revocation under subsection (4) did not violate defendant's due
    process rights.</B>Much of the delay was caused by defendant's
    failure to inform his defense counsel or the court of his
    whereabouts, and final two months of delay do not constitute a
    sufficient time interval to warrant a conclusion that the delay
    was excessive. Defendant has failed to demonstrate that he has
    suffered any other prejudice. People v. Newman, 867 P.2d 94
    (Colo. App. 1993).</P>
    <P>
    <B>Proper sanction for violation of subsection (4)</B>is
    release of the probationer from custody, and not dismissal of
    the petition. People v. Clark, 654 P.2d 847 (Colo. 1982);
    People v. Newman, 867 P.2d 94 (Colo. App. 1993).</P>
    <P>If an alleged probation violator has been held in custody up
    to the statutory time limit and has not had a hearing, he must
    be immediately released from custody, but the complaint may
    remain pending or be refiled. Only custody is forfeited if a
    hearing is not held in time. People v. Clark, 654 P.2d 847
    (Colo. 1982).</P>
    <P>
    <B>Speedy disposition of revocation petition applies to
    juveniles.</B>The speedy disposition of a revocation petition,
    guaranteed to adults under subsection (4), must be extended to
    juveniles. People in Interest of D.M., 650 P.2d 1350 (Colo.
    App. 1982).</P>
    <P>
    <B>Delay attributable to court calendar congestion</B>may be a
    permissible cause for delay under subsection (4). People in
    Interest of D.M., 650 P.2d 1350 (Colo. App. 1982).</P>
    <P>
    <B>Prosecution has burden of proving that docket congestion is
    sufficiently egregious</B>as to be good cause for the delay.
    People in Interest of D.M., 650 P.2d 1350 (Colo. App.
    1982).</P>
    <P>
    <B>Fifteen-day limitation applies to deferred sentence
    revocation hearing.</B>Since the 15-day limitation imposed by
    subsection (4) is a procedural safeguard required for probation
    revocation hearings, it applies to a deferred sentence
    revocation pursuant to § 16-7-403. People v. Schoonover, 654
    P.2d 1340 (Colo. App. 1982).</P>
    <P>
    <B>It is not bound by strict rules of evidence.</B>In a
    proceeding to determine whether probation should be revoked,
    the court will not be bound by the strict rules of evidence.
    The probation officer was subject to cross-examination
    regarding the hearsay evidence which he offered, and such was
    not an abuse of discretion by the trial court. Holdren v.
    People, 168 Colo. 474, 452 P.2d 28 (1969).</P>
    <P>
    <B>Hearsay evidence is only admissible at a revocation hearing
    if the probationer has a fair opportunity to rebut such

    <P>Triple hearsay may be sufficient to prove a violation of a

    <P>
    <B>Permitting probation officer to testify about hearsay was
    harmless beyond a reasonable doubt,</B>because trial court
    relied upon other evidence to find a probation violation.

    <P>
    <B>A trial court is not bound by the strict rules of

    Kelly, 919 P.2d 866 (Colo. App. 1996).</P>
    <P>
    <B>Since defendant knew that failure to meet conditions of
    probation might constitute extraordinary aggravating
    circumstances</B>which would justify sentencing beyond the
    presumptive range, the court was justified in doubling of
    presumptive range of sentence when defendant met neither the
    community service nor the restitution condition of probation.
    Montoya v. People, 864 P.2d 1093 (Colo. 1993).</P>
    <P>
    <B>Where the only witness lacks personal knowledge of the
    essential incriminating facts supporting the revocation of

    <P>
    <B>Defendant had a fair opportunity to rebut hearsay evidence
    offered at parole revocation hearing.</B>Although the probation
    officer did not know the identity of the sheriff deputy that
    said that defendant's roommate had said defendant did not live
    at their residence any longer, defendant did know the identity
    of his roommate. Defendant, thus, had an opportunity to rebut
    the statement of his roommate. People v. Ruch, 2013 COA 96, 374
    P.3d 485, rev'd on other grounds, 2016 CO 35, 379 P.3d 309.</P>
    <P>
    <B>After acceptance of an Alford plea, court can revoke
    probation for failure to complete counseling that requires
    defendant to admit guilt.</B>Prior to accepting plea, court
    must advise defendant of direct consequences of the conviction
    to satisfy due process concerns. Possibility that required
    counseling could not be completed and that probation would be
    revoked if the defendant did not admit guilt, is a collateral
    consequence of the guilty plea. People v. Birdsong, 958 P.2d
    1124 (Colo. 1998).</P>
    <P>
    <B>The trial court's finding that the defendant did not
    participate or cooperate in a sex offender treatment
    program</B>was supported by evidence demonstrating that the
    defendant's test results, interviews, and behavior in the
    program entrance process convinced the treatment program's
    personnel that the defendant was not motivated for treatment,
    was not giving straightforward answers to questions, was not
    prepared to accept responsibility for his crime, and was not
    amenable to outpatient treatment. People v. Ickler, 877 P.2d
    863 (Colo. 1994).</P>
    <P>
    <B>Exclusionary rule not applied in probation revocation
    hearing.</B>The overwhelming majority of cases from state and
    federal jurisdictions have refused to apply the exclusionary
    rule to improperly seized evidence in probation revocation
    hearings. People v. Atencio, 186 Colo. 76, 525 P.2d 461
    (1974).</P>
    <P>In the absence of egregious police misconduct, the
    exclusionary rule is inapplicable to probation revocation
    proceedings. People v. Ressin, 620 P.2d 717 (Colo. 1980).</P>
    <P>
    <B>And the general assembly clearly expressed its intent to
    have all probative evidence considered</B>at the hearing on
    probation revocation, even if that evidence would be excluded
    in a criminal trial. People v. Atencio, 186 Colo. 76, 525 P.2d
    461 (1974).</P>
    <P>Subsection (3) is merely a codification of the general
    policy that the exclusionary rule does not apply to improperly
    seized evidence in probation revocation hearings. People v.
    Wilkerson, 189 Colo. 448, 541 P.2d 896 (1975).</P>
    <P>
    <B>The U.S. supreme court's decision in Crawford v. Washington,
    541 U.S. 36 (2004), does not change the rule that a probation
    violation can be established by hearsay evidence, so long as
    the offering witness is subject to cross-examination.</B>The
    right to confrontation in a probation revocation hearing flows
    from the due process clause, not the confrontation clause upon
    which the Crawford court relied. People v. Turley, 109 P.3d
    1025 (Colo. App. 2004).</P>
    <P>
    <B>Defendant deprived of due process right of confrontation
    during revocation hearing.</B>There was no good cause to deny
    confrontation or find that the prosecution's hearsay evidence
    was substantially reliable. The hearsay evidence was
    unreliable, consisting of double or triple hearsay, and did not
    fall within any recognized exception to the hearsay rule.
    People v. Loveall, 203 P.3d 540 (Colo. App. 2008), aff'd, 231
    P.3d 408 (Colo. 2010).</P>
    <P>
    <B>Defendant not deprived of due process right of confrontation
    during revocation hearing.</B>Because defendant conceded that
    he had not made the necessary restitution payments, the court's
    belief that jobs were generally available was peripheral to the
    contested issue; therefore, the newspaper was not used to prove
    that defendant had violated his probation. People v. Roletto,
    2015 COA 41, 370 P.3d 190.</P>
    <P>
    <B>"Convicted" defined.</B>For the purposes of probation
    revocation under subsection (3) of this section, the term
    convicted means convicted upon trial, not when all appellate
    remedies are exhausted. People v. Salazar, 39 Colo. App. 409,
    568 P.2d 101 (1977).</P>
    <P>
    <B>Probation can be revoked prior to conviction.</B>People v.

    <P>
    <B>Standard of proof in juvenile proceedings.</B>The same
    standard of proof that obtains in adult probation revocation
    hearings, i.e., beyond a reasonable doubt, should also apply in
    juvenile proceedings. People in Interest of C.B., 40 Colo. App.
    43, 572 P.2d 843 (1977); People in Interest of C.B., 196 Colo.
    362, 585 P.2d 281 (1978).</P>
    <P>
    <B>After the 1983 amendment to subsection (3), a court is not
    required to assess a defendant's ability to pay restitution
    based exclusively on the factors identified in</B>People v.
    Romero, 192 Colo. 106, 559 P.2d 1101 (1976). People v. Roletto,
    2015 COA 41, 370 P.3d 190.</P>
    <P>
    <B>The power to alter a sentence at the time of revocation of
    probation</B>is explicitly recognized in subsection (5) and
    Crim. P. 32(f) and 35(c). People v. Jenkins, 40 Colo. App. 140,
    575 P.2d 13 (1977).</P>
    <P>
    <B>But gross official misconduct in gathering evidence not
    sanctioned.</B>Although the exclusionary rule per se does not
    apply to probation revocation hearings, gross official
    misconduct in gathering evidence for a probation revocation
    will not be sanctioned where an unreasonable search or seizure
    is such as to shock the conscience of the court. The court will
    not permit such conduct to be the basis of a state-imposed
    sanction. People v. Atencio, 186 Colo. 76, 525 P.2d 461
    (1974).</P>
    <P>While the exclusionary rule per se is inapplicable to
    probation revocation hearings, gross official misconduct by law
    enforcement officers is not condoned. People v. Wilkerson, 189
    Colo. 448, 541 P.2d 896 (1975).</P>
    <P>
    <B>Court not bound to apply original sentence upon revocation
    of probation.</B>Because suspension of a sentence is in
    conjunction with, rather than contradistinction to, the
    imposition of a statutorily prescribed alternative to
    imprisonment, the sentencing court's resentencing options upon
    revocation were dictated by statutory provisions governing
    revocation of probation. Fierro v. People, 206 P.3d 460 (Colo.
    2009).</P>
    <P>
    <B>Revocation without notice improper.</B>A trial judge has no
    power to impose sentence upon the basis of a violation of the
    conditions of probation in the absence of any notice to the
    probationer that his probation had been extended beyond the
    original period. Such a sentence violates concepts of
    fundamental fairness and due process. Jesseph v. People, 164
    Colo. 312, 435 P.2d 224 (1967).</P>
    <P>
    <B>Where probation conditioned upon child support, finding of
    ability to pay required</B>before revocation, and such finding
    should be made by the trial court. People v. Silcott, 177 Colo.
    451, 494 P.2d 835 (1972).</P>
    <P>
    <B>Requiring the court to either revoke or continue probation
    within five days of the hearing on revocation is a directory
    provision, not jurisdictional.</B>There is no basis for
    reversing the court's revocation of probation when the
    defendant consented to a hearing outside the statutory time
    period and the timing did not affect the fairness of the
    proceeding or cast doubt on the reliability of the outcome.
    People v. Heimann, 186 P.3d 77 (Colo. App. 2007).</P>
    <P>
    <B>Failure to follow statutory procedure voids
    revocation.</B>The statutory procedure for hearing and
    revocation was not followed and no evidence was presented to
    show that defendant had violated any of the terms of his
    probation. Defendant's application for counsel to initiate
    appeal proceedings was not inconsistent with probation. Snook
    v. People, 169 Colo. 95, 453 P.2d 806 (1969).</P>
    <P>
    <B>District court did not advise defendant of the charges
    against him and the possible penalties pursuant to subsection
    (2) or comply with § 18-1.3-1010 (2).</B>The court's lack of
    advisement and failure to follow the statutes constitutes plain
    error and requires reversal of the probation revocation. People
    v. Helms, 2016 COA 90, 396 P.3d 1133.</P>
    <P>
    <B>Revocation held fundamentally unfair.</B>It was
    fundamentally unfair to accept child support payments for a
    period of six months and then use as a ground for revocation of
    probation defendant's failure to make payments prior to that
    period. People v. Silcott, 177 Colo. 451, 494 P.2d 835
    (1972).</P>
    <P>
    <B>Authority of court to impose sentence upon
    revocation.</B>Upon revocation, the trial court has full
    authority to impose a sentence within the minimum and maximum
    term provided by statute for the crime. Gehl v. People, 161
    Colo. 535, 423 P.2d 332 (1967).</P>
    <P>
    <B>Consecutive sentencing</B>is an appropriate mechanism for
    imposing a distinct punishment for each of two criminal acts.
    People v. Lorenzo, 644 P.2d 50 (Colo. App. 1981).</P>
    <P>The words "which might have originally been imposed or
    granted" in subsection (5) mean that the later imposition of
    sentence shall be done in accordance with the law applicable at
    the time defendant was originally placed on probation, and they
    do not mandate concurrent rather than consecutive sentencing.
    People v. Lorenzo, 644 P.2d 50 (Colo. App. 1981).</P>
    <P>
    <B>Time on probation need not be credited against
    sentence.</B>The granting of probation is not the imposition of
    sentence or its equivalent, and time served on probation need
    not be credited against a sentence imposed upon revocation.
    Gehl v. People, 161 Colo. 535, 423 P.2d 332 (1967).</P>

    <B>Annotator's note.</B>Since § 16-11-301 is similar to
    repealed § 39-10-1, C.R.S. 1963, § 39-10-1, CRS 53, and CSA, C.
    48, § 512, relevant cases construing those provisions have been
    included in the annotations to this section. Most of the cases
    annotated were decided prior to the 1979 amendments to this
    section deleting references to the Colorado state
    reformatory.</P>
    <P>
    <B>The power to confine persons is delegated by legislative
    enactment;</B>courts have no such inherent power. Stilley v.
    Tinsley, 153 Colo. 66, 385 P.2d 677 (1963).</P>
    <P>
    <B>A penitentiary sentence is more severe than a reformatory
    sentence</B>under Colorado law because it carries the stigma of
    a felony. Petsche v. Clingan, 273 F.2d 688 (10th Cir.
    1960).</P>
    <P>
    <B>Sentence to reformatory within discretion of judge.</B>Where
    a defendant is less than 21 years of age at the time of
    sentence, a trial judge is vested with a discretion to sentence
    him to the reformatory or the state penitentiary. McKinney v.
    People, 138 Colo. 294, 332 P.2d 895 (1958).</P>
    <P>Under this section persons convicted of a crime punishable
    by imprisonment in the penitentiary who are under the age of 21
    years may, in the discretion of the court, be sentenced to the
    state reformatory or to the penitentiary, as the best interest
    of the person and of the public may require. Roy v. Tinsley,
    142 Colo. 241, 350 P.2d 564 (1960).</P>
    <P>The question of sentence, once there is a conviction, is
    left to the discretion of the court; this was clearly the
    intent of the general assembly. Bitner v. Tinsley, 151 Colo.
    367, 378 P.2d 203 (1963).</P>
    <P>The choice of place of confinement is within the sound
    discretion of the court, just as is the length of term of
    imprisonment. People v. Weihs, 187 Colo. 124, 529 P.2d 317
    (1974).</P>
    <P>
    <B>Court not bound by probation reports.</B>A probation
    officer's finding or recommendation that a defendant would
    benefit from probation does not require the trial court to
    grant probation, or to sentence defendant to an indeterminate
    term in the state reformatory. Bitner v. Tinsley, 151 Colo.
    367, 378 P.2d 203 (1963).</P>
    <P>
    <B>And sentence stands unless discretion is abused.</B>It is
    the trial court, having the opportunity to examine a petitioner
    and the probation reports, who is best equipped to determine
    where he should be required to serve his sentence, and in the
    absence of a showing of abuse of judicial discretion the
    sentence must stand. Bitner v. Tinsley, 151 Colo. 367, 378 P.2d
    203 (1963).</P>
    <P>
    <B>This section read with statute fixing penalty for
    crime.</B>In considering whether a sentence is within the
    provisions of the statute fixing the penalty for the commission
    of a crime, this section which provides for commitment to the
    reformatory in certain cases is fully applicable and applies

    <P>
    <B>Penitentiary sentence was not abuse of discretion.</B>Where
    the sentence of one convicted of a crime to the state
    reformatory or to the penitentiary rests in the discretion of
    the trial court, a petition for a writ of habeas corpus is
    properly denied where the record discloses that the
    petitioners, who were 18 years of age, had four previous
    convictions for various offenses and the probation officer
    recommended sentences to the penitentiary rather than to the
    state reformatory, and petitioners were so sentenced. Roy v.

    <B>Reformatory sentence in county different from court is

    conducts proceedings, whatever authority is essential to
    commitment therein is necessarily implied. Aranda v. Patterson,

  <M>Authority to contract with a county or a city and county for

  director.</M></CATCH-LINE>(1)
  <M>The general assembly hereby finds and declares that the
  department of corrections needs to reduce the backlog of state
  prisoners in local jails and that such reduction may occur by
  means of contracting with local jails for jail space in an amount
  equal to the number of inmates backlogged in local jails. The
  general assembly also finds and declares that it is the general
  assembly's intent that the department of corrections cooperate
  with each contracting county or city and county to select inmates
  for placement who will eventually be released in that county,
  city and county, or geographic area, or who have special
  protective needs, or who have occupational skills or plans that
  are compatible with the county's or city and county's needs.</M>

  the executive director. Subject to appropriations, the executive
  director may provide an incentive to any county or city and
  county to encourage such county or city and county to so
  contract. The incentive shall not exceed ten percent of the daily
  rate as determined pursuant to section 17-1-112, C.R.S.,
  multiplied by the number of days of confinement of any such
  person in such local jail.</M></P>
  <P N="(2)(b)">(b)
  <M>In any such placement in a local jail, the executive director
  shall be governed by the provisions of section 16-11-308 and

  facility pursuant to section 16-11-308 (5).</M></P>

  contract on July 1 of the following year.</M></P>

  <M>Commencing with the fiscal year beginning July 1, 1988, the

  <M>Legislative declaration.</M></CATCH-LINE>The general assembly
  declares that substance abuse, specifically the abuse of alcohol
  and controlled substances, is a major problem in the criminal
  justice system of the state of Colorado and in the entire nation.
  Substance abuse is a significant factor in the commission of
  crimes, and it is a significant factor in impeding the
  rehabilitation of persons convicted of crimes, which results in
  an increased rate of recidivism. Therefore, the general assembly
  resolves to curtail the disastrous effects of substance abuse in
  the criminal justice system by providing for consistency in the
  response to substance abuse throughout the criminal justice
  system and to improve and standardize substance abuse treatment
  for people at each stage of the criminal justice system and to
  provide a range of individualized behavioral responses for people
  who do not respond successfully to substance abuse treatment
  while the people are involved with the criminal justice
  system.</SECTION-TEXT>

  <M>The judicial department, the department of corrections, the

  controlled substances by offenders, which procedure shall include
  the administration of a chemical test of such offender for the
  presence of controlled substances or alcohol, or such other test
  of the offender for the presence of controlled substances or
  alcohol as deemed appropriate by the supervising agency. The
  assessment procedure developed pursuant to this paragraph (a)
  shall provide an evaluation of the extent of an offender's abuse
  of substances, if any, and recommend treatment which is
  appropriate to the needs of the particular offender.</M></P>
  <P N="(1)(b)">(b)
  <M>A system of programs for education and treatment of abuse of
  substances which can be utilized by offenders who are placed on
  probation, incarcerated with the department of corrections,
  placed on parole, or placed in community corrections. The
  programs developed pursuant to this paragraph (b) shall be as
  flexible as possible so that such programs may be utilized by
  each particular offender to the extent appropriate to that
  offender. The programs developed pursuant to this paragraph (b)
  shall be structured in such a manner that the programs provide a
  continuum of education and treatment programs for each offender
  as he proceeds through the criminal justice system and may
  include, but shall not be limited to, attendance at self-help
  groups, group counseling, individual counseling, outpatient
  treatment, inpatient treatment, day care, or treatment in a
  therapeutic community. Also, such programs shall be developed in
  such a manner that, to the extent possible, the programs may be
  accessed by all offenders in the criminal justice system. Any
  programs developed pursuant to this paragraph (b) shall include a
  system of periodic or random chemical testing for the presence of
  controlled substances or alcohol, or such other testing as
  provided in paragraph (a) of this subsection (1). The frequency
  of such testing shall be that which is appropriate to the
  particular offender in accordance with the offender's assessment
  performed pursuant to paragraph (a) of this subsection
  (1).</M></P>
  <P N="(1)(c)">(c)
  <M>A system of punitive sanctions for offenders who test positive
  for the use of substances subsequent to the initial test and
  after being placed in an education or treatment program. The
  sanctions developed pursuant to this paragraph (c) should allow
  for appropriate responses by the criminal justice system to each
  occurrence of a positive test by an offender, each of which shall
  become a permanent part of the offender's record.</M></P>

    <B>Even assuming that the department of corrections has
    authority to classify as a sex offender an inmate not found
    guilty of either a listed sex offense or an offense of which
    the underlying factual basis was a listed sex offense, due
    process requires</B>that an inmate be afforded a hearing when
    the basis for such classification is not a listed sex offense
    of which the inmate stands convicted. Fisher v. Colo. Dept. of
    Corr., 56 P.3d 1210 (Colo. App. 2002). 
    <P>
    <B>The word "history" in the definition of "sex offender" can
    include the underlying circumstances of the offense.</B>Thus,
    although the defendant pled guilty to contributing to the
    delinquency of a minor, she met the definition of a "sex
    offender" because she had engaged in soliciting for child
    prostitution, pandering of a child, procurement of a child for
    sexual exploitation, and inducement of child prostitution. The
    trial court therefore appropriately sentenced the defendant to
    treatment under the provisions of this article and required the
    defendant to register as a sex offender pursuant to §
    18-3-412.5. People v. Meidinger, 987 P.2d 937 (Colo. App.
    1999).</P>
    <P>
    <B>Although the defendant met the definition of a "sex
    offender" based on the underlying facts of the offense, the
    court could not impose the sex offender surcharge</B>pursuant
    to § 18-21-103, where defendant pled guilty to contributing to
    the delinquency of a minor, an offense that is not a "sex
    offense" as defined in subsection (3). People v. Meidinger, 987
    P.2d 937 (Colo. App. 1999).</P>
    <P>
    <B>Defendant who, in 1989, received a deferred sentence as a
    juvenile for a sexual offense had a "history" of a sex offense
    for purposes of subsection (2)(a)(II)</B>and was properly
    evaluated as a sex offender and ordered to undergo sex offender
    treatment and supervision as a condition of probation for
    felony theft and menacing convictions. The juvenile
    adjudication provision in the statute is not the only way that
    a juvenile can meet the definition of "sex offender". People v.

  <B>Standards for identification and evaluation of adult sex
  offenders.</B>(I)
  <M>The board shall develop, prescribe, and revise, as
  appropriate, a standard procedure to evaluate and identify adult
  sex offenders, including adult sex offenders with developmental
  disabilities. The procedures shall provide for an evaluation and
  identification of the adult sex offender and recommend
  management, monitoring, and treatment based upon existing
  research and shall incorporate the concepts of the
  risk-need-responsivity or another evidence-based correctional
  model. There is currently no way to ensure that adult sex
  offenders with the propensity to commit sexual offenses will not
  reoffend. Because there are adult sex offenders who can learn to
  manage unhealthy patterns and learn behaviors that can lessen
  their risk to society in the course of ongoing treatment,
  management, and monitoring, the board shall develop a procedure
  for evaluating and identifying, on a case-by-case basis, reliably
  lower-risk sex offenders whose risk to sexually reoffend may not
  be further reduced by participation in treatment as described in
  paragraph (b) of this subsection (4). The board shall develop and
  implement methods of intervention for adult sex offenders, which
  methods have as a priority the physical and psychological safety
  of victims and potential victims and which are appropriate to the
  assessed needs of the particular offender, so long as there is no
  reduction in the safety of victims and potential victims.</M></P>

  <B>Guidelines and standards for treatment of adult
  offenders.</B>(I)
  <M>The board shall develop, implement, and revise, as
  appropriate, guidelines and standards to treat adult sex
  offenders, including adult sex offenders with intellectual and
  developmental disabilities, incorporating in the guidelines and
  standards the concepts of the risk-need-responsivity or another
  evidence-based correctional model, which guidelines and standards
  can be used in the treatment of offenders who are placed on
  probation, incarcerated with the department of corrections,
  placed on parole, or placed in community corrections. Programs
  implemented pursuant to the guidelines and standards developed
  pursuant to this subsection (4)(b) must be as flexible as
  possible so that the programs may be accessed by each adult sex
  offender to prevent the offender from harming victims and
  potential victims. Programs must include a continuing monitoring
  process and a continuum of treatment options available to an
  adult sex offender as he or she proceeds through the criminal
  justice system. Treatment options must be determined by a current
  risk assessment and evaluation and may include, but need not be
  limited to, group counseling, individual counseling, family
  counseling, outpatient treatment, inpatient treatment, shared
  living arrangements, or treatment in a therapeutic community.
  Programs implemented pursuant to the guidelines and standards
  developed pursuant to this subsection (4)(b) must, to the extent
  possible, be accessible to all adult sex offenders in the
  criminal justice system, including those offenders with
  behavioral, mental health, and co-occurring disorders. The
  procedures for evaluation, identification, treatment, and
  monitoring developed pursuant to this subsection (4) must be
  implemented only to the extent that money is available in the sex
  offender surcharge fund created in section 18-21-103 (3).</M></P>
  <P N="(4)(b)(II)">(II)

  section 18-21-103 (3), C.R.S., among the judicial department, the
  department of corrections, the division of criminal justice in
  the department of public safety, and the department of human
  services. In addition, the board shall coordinate the expenditure
  of moneys from the sex offender surcharge fund with any moneys
  expended by any of the departments described in this paragraph
  (c) to identify, evaluate, and treat adult sex offenders and
  juveniles who have committed sexual offenses. The general
  assembly may appropriate moneys from the sex offender surcharge
  fund in accordance with the plan.</P>

  <B>Risk assessment screening instrument.</B>The board shall
  consult on, approve, and revise, as necessary, the risk
  assessment screening instrument developed by the division of
  criminal justice to assist the sentencing court in determining
  the likelihood that an adult sex offender will commit one or more
  of the offenses specified in section 18-3-414.5 (1)(a)(II),
  C.R.S., under the circumstances described in section 18-3-414.5
  (1)(a)(III), C.R.S. In carrying out this duty, the board shall
  consider research on adult sex offender risk assessment and shall
  consider as one element the risk posed by an adult sex offender
  who suffers from psychopathy or a personality disorder that makes
  the person more likely to engage in sexually violent predatory
  offenses. If a defendant is found to be a sexually violent
  predator, the defendant shall be required to register pursuant to
  article 22 of this title and shall be subject to community
  notification pursuant to part 9 of article 13 of this title.</P>

  <B>Evaluation of policies and procedures - report.</B>(I)
  <M>The board shall research, either through direct evaluation or
  through a review of relevant research articles and sex offender
  treatment empirical data, and analyze, through a comprehensive
  review of evidence-based practices, the effectiveness of the
  evaluation, identification, and treatment policies and procedures
  for adult sex offenders developed pursuant to this article. This
  research shall specifically include, but need not be limited to,
  reviewing and researching reoffense and factors that contribute
  to reoffense for sex offenders as defined in this article, the
  effective use of cognitive behavioral therapy to prevent
  reoffense, the use of polygraphs in treatment, and the
  containment model for adult sex offender management and treatment
  and its effective application. The board shall revise the
  guidelines and standards for evaluation, identification, and
  treatment, as appropriate, based upon the results of the board's
  research and analysis. The board shall also develop and prescribe
  a system to implement the guidelines and standards developed
  pursuant to paragraph (b) of this subsection (4).</M></P>

  <B>Criteria for measuring progress in treatment.</B>(I)
  <M>Pursuant to section 18-1.3-1009, C.R.S., concerning the
  criteria for release from incarceration, reduction in
  supervision, and discharge for certain adult sex offenders, the
  board, in collaboration with the department of corrections, the
  judicial department, and the state board of parole, shall develop
  and revise, as appropriate, criteria for measuring an adult sex
  offender's progress in treatment. The criteria shall assist the
  court and the state board of parole in determining whether an
  adult sex offender may appropriately be released from
  incarceration pursuant to section 18-1.3-1006 (1), C.R.S., or
  whether the adult sex offender's level of supervision may be
  reduced pursuant to section 18-1.3-1006 (2)(a) or 18-1.3-1008,
  C.R.S., or whether the adult sex offender may appropriately be
  discharged from probation or parole pursuant to section
  18-1.3-1006 or 18-1.3-1008, C.R.S. At a minimum, the criteria
  shall be designed to assist the court and the state board of
  parole in determining whether the adult sex offender could be
  appropriately supervised in the community if he or she were
  released from incarceration, released to a reduced level of
  supervision, or discharged from probation or parole. The criteria
  shall not limit the decision-making authority of the court or the
  state board of parole.</M></P>
  <P N="(4)(f)(II)">(II)
  <M>The board, in collaboration with the department of
  corrections, the judicial department, and the state board of
  parole, shall establish standards for community entities that
  provide supervision and treatment specifically designed for adult
  sex offenders who have developmental disabilities. At a minimum,
  the standards shall determine whether an entity would provide
  adequate support and supervision to minimize any threat that the
  adult sex offender may pose to the community.</M></P>

  <M></M>
  <B>Living arrangements for adult sex offenders -
  recommendations.</B>The board shall research, analyze, and make
  recommendations that reflect best practices for living
  arrangements for and the location of adult sex offenders within
  the community, including but not limited to shared living
  arrangements. At a minimum, the board shall consider the safety
  issues raised by the location of sex offender residences,
  especially in proximity to public or private schools and child
  care facilities, and public notification of the location of sex
  offender residences. The board shall adopt and revise as
  appropriate such guidelines as it may deem appropriate regarding
  the living arrangements and location of adult sex offenders and
  adult sex offender housing. The board shall accomplish the
  requirements specified in this paragraph (g) within existing
  appropriations.</P>
  <P N="(4)(h)(I)">(h)
  <M></M>
  <B>Data collection from treatment providers.</B>(I)
  <M>If the department of public safety acquires sufficient
  funding, the board may request that individuals or entities
  providing sex-offender-specific evaluation, treatment, or
  polygraph services that conform with standards developed by the
  board pursuant to paragraph (b) of this subsection (4) submit to
  the board data and information as determined by the board at the
  time that funding becomes available. This data and information
  may be used by the board to evaluate the effectiveness of the
  guidelines and standards developed pursuant to this article; to
  evaluate the effectiveness of individuals or entities providing
  sex-offender-specific evaluation, treatment, or polygraph
  services; or for any other purposes consistent with the
  provisions of this article.</M></P>
  <P N="(4)(h)(II)">(II)
  <M>The board shall develop a data collection plan, including
  associated costs, in consultation with the research and
  evaluation professionals on the board and within the department
  of public safety. The board shall report on the data collection
  plan to the judiciary committees of the general assembly, or any
  successor committees, as part of its annual report presented
  pursuant to section 16-11.7-109 (2) in January 2017. By July 1,
  2017, the board shall revise the guidelines and standards for
  approved providers developed pursuant to paragraphs (b) and (j)
  of this subsection (4) to require evaluators, treatment
  providers, and polygraph examiners to collect data pursuant to
  the data collection plan. If the board determines that it will be
  unable to complete the revision of the guidelines and standards
  by July 1, 2017, the board shall report to the judiciary
  committees of the general assembly, or any successor committees,
  a projected completion date as part of its annual report

  <B>Standards for identification and evaluation of juvenile
  offenders.</B>The board shall develop, prescribe, and revise, as
  appropriate, a standard procedure to evaluate and identify
  juveniles who have committed sexual offenses, including juveniles
  with developmental disabilities. The procedure shall provide for
  an evaluation and identification of the juvenile offender and
  recommend behavior management, monitoring, treatment, and
  compliance and shall incorporate the concepts of the
  risk-need-responsivity or another evidence-based correctional
  model based upon the knowledge that all unlawful sexual behavior
  poses a risk to the community and that certain juveniles may have
  the capacity to change their behavior with appropriate
  intervention and treatment. The board shall develop and implement
  methods of intervention for juveniles who have committed sexual
  offenses, which methods have as a priority the physical and
  psychological safety of victims and potential victims and that
  are appropriate to the needs of the particular juvenile offender,
  so long as there is no reduction in the safety of victims and
  potential victims.</P>

  committed sexual offenses, including juveniles with intellectual
  and developmental disabilities, incorporating in the guidelines
  and standards the concepts of the risk-need-responsivity or
  another evidence-based correctional model, which guidelines and
  standards may be used for juvenile offenders who are placed on
  probation, committed to the department of human services, placed
  on parole, or placed in out-of-home placement. Programs
  implemented pursuant to the guidelines and standards developed
  pursuant to this subsection (4)(j) must be as flexible as
  possible so that the programs may be accessed by each juvenile
  offender to prevent him or her from harming victims and potential
  victims. Programs must provide a continuing monitoring process
  and a continuum of treatment options available to a juvenile
  offender as he or she proceeds through the juvenile justice
  system. Treatment options may include, but need not be limited
  to, group counseling, individual counseling, family counseling,
  outpatient treatment, inpatient treatment, shared living
  arrangements, and treatment in a therapeutic community. Programs
  implemented pursuant to the guidelines and standards developed
  pursuant to this subsection (4)(j) must be, to the extent
  possible, accessible to all juveniles who have committed sexual
  offenses and who are in the juvenile justice system, including
  juveniles with behavioral, mental health, or co-occurring
  disorders.</P>
  <P N="(4)(j)(II)">(II)
  <M>To revise the guidelines and standards developed pursuant to

  procedures developed pursuant to this article for juveniles who
  have committed sexual offenses. The board shall revise the
  guidelines and standards for evaluation, identification, and
  treatment, as appropriate, based upon the results of the board's
  research and analysis. The board shall also develop and prescribe
  a system to implement the guidelines and standards developed
  pursuant to paragraph (j) of this subsection (4).</P>

  statement identified in section 22-1-124, C.R.S., and educational
  materials regarding general information about adult sex offenders
  and juveniles who have committed sexual offenses, safety concerns
  related to such offenders, and other relevant materials. The
  board shall provide the statement and materials to the department
  of education, and the department of education shall make the
  statement and materials available to schools in the state.</P>

    atypical and significant hardship. To evaluate whether a
    prisoner's freedom has been restrained in a manner that imposes
    atypical and significant hardship, the court must carefully

  <M>The board shall develop an application and review process for
  treatment providers, evaluators, and polygraph examiners who
  provide services pursuant to this article to adult sex offenders
  and to juveniles who have committed sexual offenses. The
  application and review process shall allow providers to
  demonstrate that they are in compliance with the standards
  adopted pursuant to this article. The application and review
  process shall consist of the following three parts:</M></P>
  <P N="(2)(a)(I)">(I)
  <M>The board shall develop separate application and review
  processes for standards that apply to the criminal justice
  component, such as criminal history record checks, for
  evaluators, individual treatment providers, and polygraph
  examiners. Applications for the criminal justice components,
  including fingerprints, shall be submitted to the board. The
  board shall forward the fingerprints to the Colorado bureau of
  investigation for use in conducting a state criminal history
  record check and for transmittal to the federal bureau of
  investigation for a national criminal history record check. The
  board may use information obtained from the state and national
  criminal history record checks to determine an applicant's
  eligibility for placement on the approved provider list. The
  board shall be responsible for the implementation of the
  provisions of this subparagraph (I).</M></P>
  <P N="(2)(a)(II)">(II)
  <M>The board shall develop an application and review process for
  the verification of the qualifications and credentials of
  evaluators, treatment providers, and polygraph examiners.</M></P>
  <P N="(2)(a)(III)">(III)
  <M>The board shall require a person who applies for placement,
  including a person who applies for continued placement, on the
  list of persons who may provide sex-offender-specific evaluation,
  treatment, and polygraph services pursuant to this article to
  submit to a current background investigation that goes beyond the
  scope of the criminal history record check described in
  subparagraph (I) of this paragraph (a). In conducting the current
  background investigation required by this subparagraph (III), the
  board shall obtain reference and criminal history information and
  recommendations that may be relevant to the applicant's fitness
  to provide sex-offender-specific evaluation, treatment, and
  polygraph services pursuant to this article.</M></P>
  <P N="(2)(b)">(b)
  <M>After the process developed pursuant to paragraph (a) of this
  subsection (2) is established and providers have met all the
  criteria of the application and review process, the board may
  approve the provider. The board and the department of regulatory
  agencies shall jointly publish at least annually a list of
  approved providers. The board shall forward the list to the
  office of the state court administrator, the department of public
  safety, the department of human services, and the department of
  corrections. The board shall update and forward the list of
  approved providers as necessary.</M></P>
  <P N="(3)">(3)
  <M>The board shall use the information obtained from the state
  and national criminal history record checks and the current
  background investigation in determining whether to place or
  continue the placement of a person on the approved provider
  list.</M></P>
  <P N="(4)">(4)
  <M>The board may determine the requirements for an evaluator's,
  treatment provider's, or polygraph examiner's name to be placed
  on the approved provider list after his or her name has been
  removed from the list for any reason.</M></P>
  <P N="(5)">(5)
  <M>The board shall develop a renewal process for the continued
  placement of a person on the approved provider list published
  pursuant to paragraph (b) of subsection (2) of this
  section.</M></P>
  <P N="(6)">(6)
  <M>The board may assess a fee to an applicant for placement on
  the approved provider list. The fee shall not exceed one hundred
  twenty-five dollars per application to cover the costs of
  conducting a current background investigation required by
  subsection (2) of this section. All moneys collected pursuant to
  this subsection (6) shall be transmitted to the state treasurer,
  who shall credit the same to the sex offender treatment provider
  fund, which fund is hereby created and referred to in this
  subsection (6) as the "fund". The moneys in the fund shall be
  subject to annual appropriation by the general assembly to the
  division of criminal justice in the department of public safety
  for the direct and indirect costs associated with the current
  background investigation required by subsection (2) of this
  section. Any moneys in the fund not expended for the purpose of
  subsection (2) of this section may be invested by the state
  treasurer as provided by law. All interest and income derived
  from the investment and deposit of moneys in the fund shall be
  credited to the fund. Any unexpended and unencumbered moneys
  remaining in the fund at the end of a fiscal year shall remain in
  the fund and shall not be credited or transferred to the general
  fund or another fund.</M></P>
  <P N="(7)(a)">(7)
  <N></N>(a)
  <M>The board shall notify the department of regulatory agencies
  of the receipt of any complaints or grievances against an
  individual who provides sex-offender-specific treatment or
  evaluation services pursuant to this article 11.7 and advise the
  department of any disciplinary action taken pursuant to
  subsection (7)(b) of this section. The department of regulatory
  agencies or the appropriate board, pursuant to article 245 of
  title 12 and referred to in this subsection (7) as the "DORA
  board", shall notify the board of the receipt of any complaint or
  grievance against a provider who provides sex-offender-specific
  treatment or evaluation services pursuant to this article 11.7,
  if the complaint or grievance was not referred by the board, and
  advise the board of any disciplinary action taken against the
  individual pursuant to any professional licensing act.</M></P>
  <P N="(7)(b)">(b)
  <M>The board shall review and investigate all complaints and
  grievances concerning compliance with its standards against
  individuals who provide sex-offender-specific treatment,
  evaluation, or polygraph services pursuant to this article.
  Notwithstanding any action taken by the department of regulatory
  agencies or the DORA board, the board may take appropriate
  disciplinary action, as permitted by law, against an individual
  who provides sex-offender-specific treatment, evaluation, or
  polygraph services pursuant to this article. The disciplinary
  action may include, but need not be limited to, the removal of
  the individual's name from the list of persons who may provide
  sex offender evaluation, treatment, or polygraph services
  pursuant to this article.</M></P>

  <P N="(4)(a)(I)">(I)
  <M>Adopt and implement a standardized procedure for the treatment
  evaluation of domestic violence offenders. Such procedure shall
  provide for the evaluation and recommend behavior management,
  monitoring, and treatment and include a procedure for when a
  treatment provider recommends that an offender does not need
  treatment. The board shall develop and implement methods of
  intervention for domestic violence offenders that have as a
  priority the physical and psychological safety of victims and
  potential victims and that are appropriate to the needs of the
  particular offender, so long as there is no reduction in the
  level of safety of victims and potential victims.</M></P>
  <P N="(4)(a)(II)">(II)
  <M>Adopt and implement guidelines and standards for a system of
  programs for the treatment of domestic violence offenders that
  shall be utilized by offenders who have committed a crime, the
  underlying factual basis of which has been found by the court on
  the record to include an act of domestic violence, and who are
  placed on probation, placed on parole, or placed in community
  corrections or who receive a deferred judgment and sentence. The
  programs developed pursuant to this subparagraph (II) shall be as
  flexible as possible so that the programs may be utilized by each
  offender to prevent the offender from harming victims and
  potential victims. The programs shall be structured in such a
  manner that they provide a continuing monitoring process as well
  as a continuum of treatment programs for each offender as that
  offender proceeds through the criminal justice system and may
  include, but shall not be limited to, group counseling,
  individual counseling, outpatient treatment, or treatment in a
  therapeutic community. Also, the programs shall be developed in
  such a manner that, to the extent possible, the programs may be
  accessed by all offenders in the criminal justice system.</M></P>
  <P N="(4)(a)(III)">(III)
  <M>Develop an application and review process for treatment
  providers who provide services to domestic violence offenders
  pursuant to subsection (4)(a)(I) or (4)(a)(II) of this section.
  The standards must allow providers to demonstrate that they are
  in compliance with the standards adopted pursuant to subsections
  (4)(a)(I) and (4)(a)(II) of this section. The application and
  review process consists of the following parts:</M></P>
  <P N="(4)(a)(III)(A)">(A)
  <M>The board shall develop separate application and review
  processes for standards that apply to the criminal justice
  component, such as criminal history record checks, for individual
  treatment providers and treatment programs. A local law
  enforcement agency or a third party approved by the Colorado
  bureau of investigation, for the purpose of obtaining a
  fingerprint-based criminal history record check, shall take the
  fingerprints of each applicant. If an approved third party takes
  the applicant's fingerprints, the fingerprints may be
  electronically captured using Colorado bureau of
  investigation-approved livescan equipment. The applicant shall
  submit payment for the fingerprints and for the actual costs of
  the record check at the time the fingerprints are submitted to
  the Colorado bureau of investigation. Upon receipt of
  fingerprints and payment for costs, the Colorado bureau of
  investigation shall conduct a state and national
  fingerprint-based criminal history record check utilizing records
  of the Colorado bureau of investigation and the federal bureau of
  investigation and shall forward the results of the criminal
  history record check to the board.</M></P>
  <P N="(4)(a)(III)(B)">(B)
  <M>The board shall develop an application and review process for
  the verification of the qualifications and credentials of the
  treatment providers. The applications must be submitted to the
  board. The board is responsible for the implementation of this
  subsection (4)(a)(III)(B) of the application and review process.
  The board shall require that treatment providers complete
  mandatory continuing education courses in areas related to
  domestic violence.</M></P>
  <P N="(4)(a)(III)(C)">(C)
  <M>After providers have met the criteria of both parts of the
  application and review process, the board shall publish at least
  annually a list of approved providers. The board shall forward
  the list to the office of the state court administrator, the
  department of public safety, the department of human services,
  and the department of corrections. The board shall update the
  list of approved providers and forward as changes are
  made.</M></P>
  <P N="(4)(a)(III)(D)">(D)
  <M>The board shall perform compliance reviews on at least ten
  percent of the treatment providers every two years beginning no
  later than July 1, 2023.</M></P>
  <P N="(4)(a)(III.3)">(III.3)
  <M>Notwithstanding any action taken by the department of
  regulatory agencies against a treatment provider, the board may
  take independent action against a treatment provider including,
  but not limited to, removing a treatment provider from the
  approved provider list. The board may determine the requirements
  for a treatment provider's name to be placed on the list after
  the name has been removed from the list pursuant to this
  subsection (4)(a)(III.3).</M></P>
  <P N="(4)(a)(III.5)">(III.5)
  <M>Develop a treatment provider renewal process for the continued
  placement of a person on the approved provider list published
  pursuant to sub-subparagraph (C) of subparagraph (III) of this
  paragraph (a);</M></P>
  <P N="(4)(a)(IV)">(IV)
  <M>Research and analyze the effectiveness of the treatment

  finds and declares that, based upon the findings and
  recommendations of the 1999 interim committee to study the
  treatment of persons with mental illness in the Colorado criminal
  justice system, detecting behavioral or mental health disorders
  in persons in the criminal justice system is a difficult process
  with no current statewide standards or requirements. The lack of
  a standardized screening process to detect persons with
  behavioral or mental health disorders in the criminal justice
  system is a significant impediment to consistent identification,
  diagnosis, treatment, and rehabilitation of all offenders with
  behavioral or mental health disorders, ultimately resulting in an
  increased rate of recidivism. Therefore, the general assembly
  resolves to create a standardized screening process to be
  utilized at each stage of the criminal justice system to identify
  persons with behavioral or mental health
  disorders.</SECTION-TEXT>

  <M>The general assembly finds and declares that:</M>
  <P N="(1)(a)">(a)
  <M>Colorado's citizens who are living with mental health and
  substance use disorders are overrepresented in the criminal
  justice system, and they are at a significantly greater risk of
  incurring criminal justice involvement, longer terms of
  involvement, and harsher consequences of that involvement when
  compared to the general public;</M></P>
  <P N="(1)(b)">(b)
  <M>Colorado must make a commitment to ensure that all individuals
  within the criminal justice system are treated fairly and
  humanely, regardless of their behavioral health history or mental
  state; and</M></P>
  <P N="(1)(c)">(c)
  <M>There is a significant need for enhanced communication among
  health-care systems, behavioral health systems, and criminal
  justice entities, including law enforcement, defense attorneys,
  district attorneys, judges, and probation, to foster
  collaboration that provides all individuals with a fair chance of
  living a healthy and productive life.</M></P>
  <P N="(2)">(2)
  <M>The general assembly further finds that:</M></P>
  <P N="(2)(a)">(a)
  <M>Colorado has an obligation to ensure that entities within the
  criminal justice system are equipped with a greater understanding
  of behavioral health treatment options in the community;
  and</M></P>
  <P N="(2)(b)">(b)
  <M>Community mental health providers, including community mental
  health centers, are a critical component of achieving positive
  outcomes for individuals living with mental health, behavioral
  health, and substance use disorders and have long held an
  essential role in engaging criminal justice entities.</M></P>
  <P N="(3)">(3)
  <M>The general assembly therefore finds that it is critical to
  create a network of professionals who can comprehensively bridge
  the criminal justice system and the community behavioral health
  systems across the state in order to:</M></P>
  <P N="(3)(a)">(a)
  <M>Promote positive outcomes for individuals living with mental

  <P N="(3)(b)">(b)

  <P N="(3)(c)">(c)
  <M>Connect individuals to behavioral health services.</M></P>
  <P N="(4)">(4)
  <M>Therefore, the general assembly declares that a statewide
  behavioral health court liaison program must provide a method for
  collaboration and consultation among behavioral health providers,
  district attorneys, and defense attorneys about available
  community-based behavioral health services and supports,
  competency evaluations, restoration to competency services, and
  other relevant decisions and issues facing individuals with
  mental health or co-occurring behavioral health conditions who

    <P>
    <B>Common-law right to review recognized by statute.</B>In
    Colorado the common-law right of the defendant to obtain
    appellate review of criminal proceedings was given statutory
    recognition and standing as far back as 1861 by the territorial
    legislature. Krutka v. Spinuzzi, 153 Colo. 115, 384 P.2d 928

    <P>
    <B>Only in cases tried de novo by the district court will the
    district court judgment be subject to direct
    appeal.</B>Justifiably, then, the defendant may seek direct
    appeal when the district court enters its judgment from a de
    novo trial. Bovard v. People, 99 P.3d 585 (Colo. 2004).</P>

    People, 99 P.3d 585 (Colo. 2004).</P>
    <P>
    <B>Section gives one appeal as a matter of right.</B>Under this
    section, one convicted of crime is entitled as a matter of
    right to one appeal, but where such appeal is dismissed for
    want of prosecution, he is not entitled as a matter of right to
    a second. Caviness v. People, 27 Colo. 283, 60 P. 565

    <P>
    <B>Appellate review may not discriminate on account of
    poverty.</B>A state is not required by the federal constitution
    to provide appellate courts or a right to appellate review at
    all. But a state that does grant appellate review cannot do so
    in a way that discriminates against some convicted defendants
    on account of their poverty. In re Patterson, 136 Colo. 401,
    317 P.2d 1041 (1957).</P>
    <P>
    <B>Appeals in criminal cases are a matter of right.</B>In re
    Patterson, 136 Colo. 410, 317 P.2d 1041 (1957); In re Griffin,
    152 Colo. 347, 382 P.2d 202 (1963).</P>
    <P>
    <B>Because this section creates a statutory right of appeal of
    a conviction, the common law doctrine of abatement ab initio
    applies if defendant dies after filing the appeal but before
    the appeal can be decided.</B>However, the order of restitution
    entered against defendant at the time of conviction created a
    civil judgment and was not subject to abatement but could be
    appealed by defendant's estate. People v. Daly, 313 P.3d 571
    (Colo. App. 2011), overruled in People v. Johnson, 2021 CO 79,
    499 P.3d 1045.</P>
    <P>
    <B>When a defendant dies while his criminal conviction is
    pending on direct appeal, the doctrine of abatement ab initio
    extinguishes a restitution order entered as part of his
    sentence.</B>People v. Johnson, 2020 COA 124, 487 P.3d 1262,
    aff'd, 2021 CO 79, 499 P.3d 1045 (overruling People v. Daly,
    313 P.3d 571 (Colo. App. 2011)).</P>
    <P>
    <B>An indigent defendant is entitled to obtain a free
    transcript when necessary to exercise the right of
    appeal.</B>People v. Shearer, 181 Colo. 237, 508 P.2d 1249
    (1973).</P>
    <P>
    <B>Appeal without benefit of counsel is
    unconstitutional.</B>Where the merits of the one and only
    appeal an indigent has as of right are decided without benefit
    of counsel, an unconstitutional line has been drawn between
    rich and poor. In re Griffin, 152 Colo. 347, 382 P.2d 202
    (1963).</P>
    <P>
    <B>The supreme court is authorized as a matter of procedure to
    fix the time within which an appeal could issue.</B>Johnson v.
    People, 140 Colo. 256, 344 P.2d 181 (1959), cert. denied, 361

    <P>
    <B>Waiver of right to appeal.</B>A defendant cannot waive the
    right to challenge an illegal sentence because there cannot be
    a valid agreement to an illegal sentence. Such a sentence
    cannot validly be imposed and renders the plea agreement with
    its resulting guilty plea invalid. People v. Bottenfield, 159

  <M>The general assembly urges the Colorado supreme court to adopt
  an expedited process to review class 1 felony convictions where

  court granting or denying postconviction relief in such cases. It
  is the general assembly's intent that the Colorado supreme court

  <M>Appeals by the prosecution.</M></CATCH-LINE>(1)
  <M>The prosecution may appeal any decision of a court in a
  criminal case upon any question of law. Any order of a court that
  either dismisses one or more counts of a charging document prior
  to trial or grants a new trial after the entry of a verdict or
  judgment shall constitute a final order that shall be immediately
  appealable pursuant to this subsection (1). If any act of the
  general assembly is adjudged inoperative or unconstitutional in
  any criminal case, it is the duty of the district attorney of the
  judicial district in which the court making such decision is
  situated to appeal on behalf of the people of the state of
  Colorado, unless the same issue of constitutionality is already
  pending before a reviewing court in another case. Nothing in this
  section shall authorize placing the defendant in jeopardy a
  second time for the same offense. No docket fee shall be required
  of the people upon an appeal under this section. The procedure to
  be followed in filing and prosecuting appeals under this section
  shall be as provided by applicable rule of the supreme court of
  Colorado. However, if a statute providing for the imposition of
  the death penalty is adjudged inoperative or inapplicable for any
  reason, such adjudication shall constitute a final order that
  shall be immediately appealable to the supreme court of Colorado,
  notwithstanding any statute or court rule to the contrary.</M>
  <P N="(2)">(2)
  <M>The prosecution may file an interlocutory appeal in the
  supreme court from a ruling of the trial court granting a motion
  made in advance of trial by the defendant for the return of
  property and to suppress evidence or granting a motion to
  suppress an extrajudicial confession or admission if the
  prosecution certifies to the judge who granted such motion and to
  the supreme court that the appeal is not taken for the purposes
  of delay and the evidence is a substantial part of the proof of
  the charge pending against the defendant. The prosecution may
  also file an interlocutory appeal in the supreme court from a
  ruling of the trial court granting a motion in limine pertaining
  to the matters described in this subsection (2), or from a ruling
  on a motion made pursuant to section 18-1-202 (11), C.R.S.,

    <ANNO-TEXT>
    <B>Annotator's note.</B>Since § 16-12-102 is similar to
    repealed § 39-7-26, CRS 1963, § 39-7-27, CRS 53, CSA, C 48, §
    500, relevant cases construing those provisions have been
    included in the annotations to this section. 
    <P>
    <B>Appeal by people to review judgment of acquittal did not
    exist at common law</B>or when the state constitution was
    adopted in 1876. Krutka v. Spinuzzi, 153 Colo. 115, 384 P.2d
    928 (1963).</P>
    <P>
    <B>Purpose of appeal.</B>Appeals are not allowed for the mere
    purpose of delay, or to present purely abstract legal
    questions, however, important or interesting, but to correct
    errors injuriously affecting the right of some party to the
    litigation. Miller v. Reeder, 157 Colo. 134, 401 P.2d 604
    (1965).</P>
    <P>The purpose of appellate review is essentially twofold: to
    settle the controversy, and to provide explanation of and to
    give clarity to questions of law by means of published
    opinions. People v. Kirkland, 174 Colo. 362, 483 P.2d 1349
    (1971); People v. May, 182 Colo. 29, 511 P.2d 22 (1973).</P>
    <P>
    <B>An appeal does not lie at the instance of the state unless
    clearly authorized by this section.</B>People v. Zobel, 54
    Colo. 284, 130 P. 837 (1913).</P>
    <P>
    <B>Prosecution may file direct appeal as to a question of law
    following the dismissal of all charges without prejudice at the
    prosecution's request following trial court's evidentiary
    ruling that rendered the prosecution unable to proceed to
    trial.</B>The finality of judgment requirement of C.A.R. 1 was
    satisfied when all charges were dismissed and the case was
    ended. People v. Gabriesheski, 262 P.3d 653 (Colo. 2011).</P>
    <P>
    <B>The plain text of the statute allows the prosecution to
    appeal dismissal of a count when other counts remain against
    the defendant.</B>People v. Collins, 32 P.3d 636 (Colo. App.
    2001); People v. Beck, 187 P.3d 1125 (Colo. App. 2008).</P>
    <P>
    <B>The prosecution may appeal a dismissal of a count prior to
    trial even when the appeal is not based on a question of
    law.</B>People v. Collins, 32 P.3d 636 (Colo. App. 2001).</P>
    <P>
    <B>As where there is a question to decide for future guidance
    of trial courts.</B>Where, on appeal in behalf of the state,
    there is no proper question to decide for guidance of trial
    courts in the future, the appeal will be dismissed. People v.
    Denver Athletic Club, 63 Colo. 189, 164 P. 1158 (1917).</P>
    <P>
    <B>Or where a legislative act has been held invalid.</B>An
    appeal may be issued on behalf of the people to review court
    judgments holding legislative acts inoperative or
    unconstitutional. People v. Bristol, 92 Colo. 325, 20 P.2d 309
    (1933).</P>
    <P>
    <B>Or question of law.</B>This section permits appeals on
    behalf of the people to review decisions of the trial court
    upon questions of law arising in any criminal case. People v.
    Spinuzzi, 149 Colo. 391, 369 P.2d 427 (1962).</P>
    <P>The people are limited on appeal to questions of law. People
    v. Ware, 187 Colo. 28, 528 P.2d 224 (1974).</P>
    <P>Because subsection (1) authorizes the people to appeal any
    decision of the trial court in a criminal case upon any
    question of law, C.A.R. 4(b)(2) requires an appellate court to
    issue a written decision. People v. Wilburn, 2013 COA 135, 343
    P.3d 998.</P>
    <P>Prosecution's appeal, which raises no questions of law, is
    improper under this section. People v. Chmielewski, 187 Colo.
    268, 529 P.2d 1337 (1975).</P>
    <P>
    <B>Or where complaint dismissed for lack of
    indictment.</B>Under this section an appeal will lie on behalf
    of the people to review a judgment of a justice dismissing a
    complaint charging defendants with commission of a misdemeanor
    on the ground that the prosecution was not instituted by
    indictment or information. People v. Read, 132 Colo. 390, 288
    P.2d 347 (1955).</P>
    <P>
    <B>An order granting a new trial is a final order pursuant to
    this section, therefore, prosecution must file its appeal
    within 45 days of the order.</B>People v. Curren, 228 P.3d 253
    (Colo. App. 2009).</P>
    <P>
    <B>Appropriateness of exclusion of witnesses a question of
    law.</B>Whether the sanction imposed by the trial court --
    exclusion of the witnesses -- for failure to comply with Crim.
    P. 16 (pt.II)(c), was appropriate under the facts and
    circumstances of this case matter within the sound discretion
    of the trial court, and an appropriate question of law under
    this section. People v. Lyle, 200 Colo. 236, 613 P.2d 896
    (1980).</P>
    <P>
    <B>Trial court's interpretation of phrase in statute under
    which defendant was charged is a question of law reviewable
    under this section.</B>People v. Miller, 97 P.3d 171 (Colo.
    App. 2003).</P>
    <P>
    <B>Appropriateness and validity of technically defective notice
    of appeal</B>is a question of law. People v. Bost, 770 P.2d
    1209 (Colo. 1989).</P>
    <P>
    <B>The prosecution can appeal a court's ruling on a defendant's
    Crim. P. 35 motion challenging a sentence.</B>People v.
    Hunsaker, 2013 COA 5, 411 P.3d 36, aff'd, 2015 CO 46, 351 P.3d
    388.</P>
    <P>
    <B>The prosecution can appeal the court's imposed sentence when
    the basis for the challenge is that the court applied the wrong
    sentencing range.</B>The prosecution can appeal questions of
    law, and the statutory interpretation of the correct sentencing
    range is a question of law. Hunsaker v. People, 2015 CO 46, 351
    P.3d 388.</P>
    <P>
    <B>Suppression of evidence is a question of law;</B>therefore
    the prosecution may pursue an interlocutory appeal when a
    motion to suppress evidence is granted. People v. Lewis, 813
    P.2d 813 (Colo. App. 1991).</P>
    <P>
    <B>Suppression of a confession given in the absence of a
    Miranda advisement was warranted</B>where a defendant was
    vigorously chased, threatened at gunpoint, sprayed with mace,
    and ultimately subdued and handcuffed, because, despite the
    arresting officers' belief that they did not have probable
    cause to arrest the defendant, it would appear to a reasonable
    person that the defendant's freedom of action or movement had
    been curtailed to a degree associated with a formal arrest in
    terms of both severity and duration. People v. Mangum, 48 P.3d
    568 (Colo. 2002).</P>
    <P>
    <B>Suppression of incriminating statements warranted when
    defendant was subject to interrogation by police officers
    before being advised of Miranda rights.</B>A routine encounter
    turned into a custodial situation, as defendant was physically
    surrounded by officers, was not free to go during questioning,
    and had "objective reasons to believe that he was under
    arrest"; such circumstances constituted custody. People v.
    Null, 233 P.3d 670 (Colo. 2010).</P>
    <P>
    <B>Suppression of involuntary blood alcohol test results in a
    vehicular homicide prosecution was erroneous because probable
    cause to administer the test existed</B>when eyewitnesses saw
    the defendant's car veer into oncoming traffic, no other cause
    for the accident was apparent, and police officers found beer
    bottles and smelled alcohol in the defendant's car. People v.
    Schall, 59 P.3d 848 (Colo. 2002).</P>
    <P>
    <B>Only three circumstances for interlocutory appeal of a
    suppression order.</B>Review is proper where evidence was
    suppressed due to: (1) An unlawful search and seizure; (2) an
    involuntary confession or admission; or (3) an improperly
    ordered or insufficiently supported, nontestimonial
    identification. People v. Braunthal, 31 P.3d 167 (Colo.
    2001).</P>
    <P>
    <B>Review pursuant to subsection (1) not appropriate</B>where
    argument in essence challenges trial court's assessment of the
    evidence and does not properly pose a question of law. People
    v. Fagerholm, 768 P.2d 689 (Colo. 1989).</P>
    <P>
    <B>No proper jurisdiction to hear an appeal</B>when appeal
    involves an evidentiary issue that implicates factual as well
    as legal issues. People v. Martinez, 22 P.3d 915 (Colo.
    2001).</P>
    <P>The prosecution could not appeal the validity of an initial
    search because it was not challenging the ruling based on a
    question of law. The prosecution's arguments included factual
    issues related to the question of good faith. People v. George,
    2017 COA 75, 488 P.3d 1159.</P>
    <P>
    <B>Court of appeals has jurisdiction to decide if trial court
    erred in granting new trial under a postconviction relief
    motion</B>when issues in motion were brought pursuant to the
    "other remedies" portion of Crim. P. 35. People v. Naranjo, 821
    P.2d 836 (Colo. App. 1991).</P>
    <P>
    <B>Court of appeals had appellate jurisdiction because trial
    court ultimately dismissed the charges against defendant, which
    resulted in a final judgment.</B>Regardless of whether the
    order declining to revoke defendant's deferred judgment was
    immediately appealable, the finality requirement was met when
    the trial court dismissed all of the charges. People v.
    Wilburn, 2013 COA 135, 343 P.3d 998.</P>
    <P>
    <B>Trial court's finding in the preliminary hearing that a
    killing was completely independent of a burglary</B>was not
    binding on the appellate court. People v. Lewis, 791 P.2d 1152
    (Colo. App. 1989).</P>
    <P>
    <B>Dismissal of prosecution based solely on reviewing content
    of document was matter of law and therefore
    reviewable.</B>People v. Marston, 772 P.2d 615 (Colo.
    1989).</P>
    <P>
    <B>A denial of the prosecution's request for a presentence
    investigation report, when such a report is mandated by
    statute, clearly presents a question of law appealable under
    this section.</B>People v. Gretz, 973 P.2d 110 (Colo. App.
    1998).</P>
    <P>
    <B>Legal significance of delays in defendant's trial appealable
    matter.</B>Where the trial court ruled that the delays in
    defendant's trial were at the request and for the benefit of
    the defendant, the facts are undisputed, and the only question
    is their legal significance, which is an appealable matter.
    People v. Reliford, 186 Colo. 6, 525 P.2d 467 (1974).</P>
    <P>
    <B>But questions of fact cannot be the subject of
    appeal</B>proceedings by which the people seek disapproval of
    an action of the trial court. People v. Ledesma, 171 Colo. 407,
    468 P.2d 27 (1970).</P>
    <P>Where determination that delays in bringing defendant to
    trial involved resolutions of fact questions, the district
    attorney could not appeal such determinations. People v.
    Murphy, 183 Colo. 106, 515 P.2d 107 (1973).</P>
    <P>C.A.R. 4(b) and this section give the district attorney the
    right to appeal a judgment of a trial court in a criminal case
    upon any question of law. However, such an appeal, involving
    sufficiency of the evidence, is seldom productive of any
    precedential value. The district attorney's time and efforts
    can be better utilized than prosecuting appeals such as this.
    Appeals by district attorneys should be avoided in cases which
    do not involve egregious error by the trial court. People v.
    Samora, 188 Colo. 74, 532 P.2d 946 (1975).</P>
    <P>
    <B>Subsection (1) does not permit interlocutory appeals in all
    cases where a trial court declares a statute
    unconstitutional.</B>Where ruling that statute was
    unconstitutional was not analogous to a final judgment but
    instead represented one step toward the resolution of the
    defendant's Crim. P. 35 (c) motion, and where immediate
    appellate review was not necessary, appeal was dismissed for
    lack of appellate jurisdiction. People v. Romero, 801 P.2d 1192
    (Colo. 1990).</P>
    <P>
    <B>Nor will sufficiency of evidence be reviewed.</B>The accused
    being acquitted, the court will not entertain an appeal on
    behalf of the people merely to determine the sufficiency of the
    evidence to warrant a conviction, where it is improbable that a
    similar state of facts will again be presented, or where a
    consideration of the testimony, and any declarations upon it,
    will neither establish any principle of law nor be a guide in
    subsequent prosecutions. People v. Kippy, 64 Colo. 597, 173 P.
    395 (1918), overruled insofar as inconsistent, People v.
    Kirkland, 174 Colo. 362, 483 P.2d 1349 (1971).</P>
    <P>If the question of the sufficiency of the evidence as a
    whole is not reviewable on an appeal prosecuted by the people,
    certainly the question of the sufficiency of that evidence as
    to any particular element of a crime such as the venue, the
    identity of the defendant, or the corpus delicti, where there
    is nothing in the testimony to make it specially applicable to
    other cases which may follow, is not so reviewable. People v.
    Archer, 173 Colo. 299, 477 P.2d 791 (1970), overruled insofar
    as inconsistent, People v. Kirkland, 174 Colo. 362, 483 P.2d
    1349 (1971).</P>
    <P>Appeals by prosecution where the sole issue is the
    sufficiency of the evidence to sustain a conviction are not
    favored. People v. Thompson, 748 P.2d 793 (Colo. 1988).</P>
    <P>
    <B>The state may appeal a grant of a new trial.</B>People v.
    Smith, 921 P.2d 80 (Colo. App. 1996).</P>
    <P>
    <B>Appellate review precluded</B>by the failure of the people
    to object at the sentencing hearing to the imposition of a
    sentence within the presumptive range when the defendant was
    convicted of possession of contraband while in a correctional
    institution, or to request the trial court, pursuant to Crim.
    P. 35(a), to correct the sentence. People v. Gallegos, 764 P.2d
    76 (Colo. 1988).</P>
    <P>
    <B>Acquittal on motion involving sufficiency is question of
    law.</B>The issue of sufficiency of the evidence as postured
    where the trial court has granted the defendant's motion for
    judgment of acquittal involves a question of law, and as such,
    the district attorney is given authority to appeal. People v.
    Kirkland, 174 Colo. 362, 483 P.2d 1349 (1971).</P>
    <P>
    <B>The final judgment for purposes of appeal</B>was entered
    when trial court reversed its previous order imposing costs on
    the defendant, and therefore state's appeal taken more than 30
    days after sentencing was proper. People v. Fisher, 189 Colo.
    297, 539 P.2d 1258 (1975).</P>
    <P>
    <B>For purposes of appeal, a final judgment must include the
    sentence.</B>Therefore, after the sentence was vacated on
    appeal, an order withdrawing plea of guilty was not a final
    judgment. Ellsworth v. People, 987 P.2d 264 (Colo. 1999).</P>
    <P>
    <B>Prosecutor's appeal pursuant to this section is subject to
    the final judgment requirement of C.A.R. 1.</B>People v.
    Guatney, 214 P.3d 1049 (Colo. 2009).</P>
    <P>
    <B>Court order granting defendant's motion seeking the return
    of marijuana and marijuana plants pursuant to art. XVIII, § 14
    (2)(e), of the state constitution is a final judgment subject
    to appeal under this section.</B>People v. Crouse, 2013 COA
    174, 412 P.3d 599, rev'd on other grounds, 2017 CO 5, 388 P.3d
    39.</P>
    <P>
    <B>An order declining to revoke probation is not a final
    judgment within meaning of C.A.R. 1,</B>thus the court of
    appeals lacked jurisdiction to entertain the appeal. People v.
    Guatney, 214 P.3d 1049 (Colo. 2009).</P>
    <P>
    <B>A court order dismissing the charges against the defendant
    based on a finding that the defendant was incompetent to
    proceed with no probability of restoration is a final,
    appealable order.</B>People v. Ong, 2021 COA 113, 499 P.3d
    375.</P>
    <P>
    <B>A stay issued under § 16-8.5-116 (10) of the dismissal order
    issued under § 16-8.5-116 (4) does not extend the finality of
    the order for purposes of timely filing an appeal.</B>There was
    nothing more for the court to do in the competency proceedings,
    and the stay was issued to facilitate the transfer of the case
    from the criminal court to civil mental health proceedings.
    People v. Ong, 2021 COA 113, 499 P.3d 375.</P>
    <P>
    <B>Interlocutory appeals permitted.</B>This section contains no
    language which would limit the people's right to appeal solely
    to final judgments of the trial court and, therefore, it
    permits interlocutory appeals. People v. Traubert, 199 Colo.
    322, 608 P.2d 342 (1980).</P>
    <P>
    <B>Generally, interlocutory appeals authorized by statute are
    permissive rather than mandatory,</B>and failure to pursue an
    immediate appeal does not preclude appeal of the issue when it
    merges into the final judgment. People v. Richardson, 58 P.3d
    1039 (Colo. App. 2002).</P>
    <P>People's appeal filed within 45 days after defendant's
    sentencing was timely. People v. Richardson, 58 P.3d 1039
    (Colo. App. 2002).</P>
    <P>
    <B>An appeal that is classified as challenging a final order
    under subsection (1) for purposes of appellate jurisdiction is
    not necessarily precluded from being interlocutory</B>in nature
    so as to toll the speedy trial period under § 18-1-405 (6)(b).
    People v. Curren, 2014 COA 59M, 348 P.3d 467.</P>
    <P>Prosecution's appeal from a new trial order must be
    characterized as interlocutory in nature, so as to toll the
    speedy trial period under § 18-1-405 (6)(b), so long as the
    appeal is taken in good faith, is filed before the defendant is
    convicted, and is necessarily disruptive of the course of
    proceeding to a final resolution. People v. Gallegos, 946 P.2d
    946 (Colo. 1997); People v. Curren, 2014 COA 59M, 348 P.3d
    467.</P>
    <P>
    <B>In order to toll the time for filing an interlocutory
    appeal, a motion to reconsider a trial court order of
    suppression must be filed within ten days of the date of the
    order of suppression.</B>People v. Powers, 47 P.3d 686 (Colo.
    2002).</P>
    <P>
    <B>Only mechanism for review of district court's determination
    on appeal from county court is by certiorari</B>to the supreme
    court as specified in § 13-6-310 (4). People v. Gonzales, 198
    Colo. 546, 603 P.2d 139 (1979); People v. Luna, 648 P.2d 624
    (Colo. 1982).</P>
    <P>
    <B>Only parties aggrieved may appeal.</B>The word aggrieved
    refers to a substantial grievance, the denial to the party of
    some claim of right, either of property or of person, or the
    imposition upon him of some burden or obligation. Miller v.
    Reeder, 157 Colo. 134, 401 P.2d 604 (1965).</P>
    <P>Only a party to the original proceeding may sue out an
    appeal. Where the district attorney was not a party to the
    proceedings below, the parties being the people of the state of
    Colorado versus Reeder, and is not a party aggrieved, he cannot
    be an appellant in the supreme court. Miller v. Reeder, 157
    Colo. 134, 401 P.2d 604 (1965).</P>
    <P>
    <B>Error asserted by state must be prejudicial.</B>Under this
    section the district attorney is authorized to raise by appeal
    certain questions, but that right must be predicated upon the
    theory that the errors committed were prejudicial to the
    people. People v. Wolff, 111 Colo. 46, 137 P.2d 693 (1943).</P>
    <P>Although the district attorney is entitled to the judgment
    of the supreme court on questions important to the prosecution
    of similar cases in the future, it is essential that material
    errors, prejudicial to the state in the particular case and
    covered by the statement of errors, be disclosed by the record.
    People v. Hill, 116 Colo. 436, 181 P.2d 360 (1947).</P>
    <P>
    <B>Erroneous rulings should be enumerated in opening
    brief.</B>When the people appeal under this section upon a
    question of law following an acquittal, they should enumerate
    in their opening brief the erroneous rulings of which complaint
    is made. The supreme court will direct its attention only to
    such issues so mentioned, unless manifest error appears. People
    v. Martin, 192 Colo. 491, 561 P.2d 776 (1977).</P>
    <P>
    <B>Trial court's findings of fact are entitled to
    deference</B>by a reviewing court, but when the absence of
    factual findings regarding key contested issues hinders
    appellate review, or when unresolved evidentiary conflicts

  <M>In any case in which a defendant has been convicted of a class
  1 felony and been sentenced to death, all motions for
  postconviction review and all postconviction review proceedings
  are governed by this part 2 and by the supreme court rules
  adopted to implement this part 2.</M>
  <P N="(1)(b)">(b)
  <M>Any motion for postconviction review shall state with
  particularity the grounds upon which the defendant intends to
  rely, including a statement of the facts and citations of law. A
  motion for postconviction review may include only those issues
  specified in paragraph (c) of this subsection (1) and shall not
  include any issues that were raised at the entry of any guilty
  plea, before trial, at trial, at the penalty phase hearing, or in
  the motion for new trial.</M></P>
  <P N="(1)(c)">(c)
  <M>A motion for postconviction review may raise only the
  following issues:</M></P>
  <P N="(1)(c)(I)">(I)
  <M>Whether there exists evidence of material facts, not
  previously presented and heard, which by the exercise of
  reasonable diligence could not have been known or learned by the
  defendant or trial counsel prior to the imposition of the
  sentence and which require that the conviction or the death
  sentence be vacated in the interests of justice; or</M></P>
  <P N="(1)(c)(II)">(II)
  <M>Whether the conviction was obtained or the sentence was
  imposed in violation of the constitution or laws of the United
  States or Colorado; or</M></P>
  <P N="(1)(c)(III)">(III)
  <M>Whether the defendant was convicted under a statute that
  violates the constitution of the United States or Colorado or
  whether the conduct for which the defendant was prosecuted was
  constitutionally protected; or</M></P>
  <P N="(1)(c)(IV)">(IV)
  <M>Whether the judgment was rendered without jurisdiction over
  the defendant or the subject matter; or</M></P>
  <P N="(1)(c)(V)">(V)
  <M>Any other grounds that are properly the basis for collateral
  attack upon a criminal judgment; or</M></P>
  <P N="(1)(c)(VI)">(VI)
  <M>Whether trial counsel rendered ineffective assistance.</M></P>
  <P N="(2)">(2)
  <M>By alleging that trial counsel rendered ineffective
  assistance, the defendant automatically waives confidentiality
  pursuant to the provisions of section 18-1-417, C.R.S., between
  the defendant and trial counsel but only with respect to the
  information that is related to the defendant's claim of
  ineffective assistance.</M></P>
  <P N="(3)">(3)
  <M>Neither the defendant nor the prosecution may file a motion
  for reconsideration or rehearing of the trial court's ruling on
  the motion for postconviction review. The granting or denying of
  a motion for postconviction review under this section is a final
  order reviewable on appeal by the Colorado supreme
  court.</M></P></SECTION-TEXT>

    <B>Annotator's note.</B>Since § 16-13-216 is similar to
    repealed § 39-19-6, CRS 53, a relevant case construing that
    provision has been included in the annotations to this section.
    
    <P>
    <B>This section does not confer judicial or sentencing powers
    on board.</B>Section 16-13-203 providing for commitment to a
    state institution of not less than one day nor more than life,
    and subsection (2) of this section authorizing the parole board
    to transfer such persons after sentence to other institutions
    to effectuate purposes of act, do not confer judicial powers on
    the parole board or involve the sentencing authority of the
    court. Trueblood v. Tinsley, 148 Colo. 503, 366 P.2d 655
    (1961), cert. denied, 370 U.S. 929, 82 S. Ct. 1570, 8 L. Ed. 2d

    <P>
    <B>Purpose of section.</B>The sex offenders act is concerned
    with the more efficient control, treatment, and rehabilitation
    of persons convicted of sex offenses. Control of the person
    must be assured before treatment and rehabilitation is
    undertaken; this may require incarceration in the penitentiary.

    <P>
    <B>It empowers the parole board to transfer
    persons</B>sentenced under this act among institutions when
    deemed appropriate to effectuate purposes of act. Trueblood v.

    <P>
    <B>Habeas corpus is not the remedy to rectify failure of the
    parole board to perform its duty to transfer prisoners</B>under
    this section. Trueblood v. Tinsley, 148 Colo. 503, 366 P.2d 655
    (1961), cert. denied, 370 U.S. 929, 82 S. Ct. 1570, 8 L. Ed. 2d

    treatment,</B>it can condition parole upon participation in a
    sex offender treatment program. Christensen v. People, 869 P.2d
    1256 (Colo. 1994).</P>
    <P>
    <B>Once a sex offender is sentenced to an indeterminate term
    under the sex offenders act, the authority to make parole or
    release decisions rests with the parole board.</B>Because sex
    offender's habeas corpus petition did not set forth facts
    which, if proven, would entitle him to immediate release and he
    alleged no facts showing that the parole board's denial of
    parole or release was unconstitutional, defendant's petition
    must be dismissed. Christensen v. People, 869 P.2d 1256 (Colo.
    1994).</P>
    <P>
    <B>The provisions of subsection (1) granting yearly parole
    consideration for persons sentenced to an indeterminate term
    pursuant to § 16-13-203 conflict with the provisions of §
    17-2-201 (4)(a), which allow the parole board to consider
    parole for sex offenders every three years.</B>Since § 17-2-201
    (4)(a) is the later enacted statute, the provisions of that
    section prevail. A person sentenced to an indeterminate
    sentence pursuant to § 16-13-203 is entitled to parole
    consideration only every three years. White v. Van Pelt, 55
    P.3d 823 (Colo. App. 2002).</P>
    <P>
    <B>Review satisfies procedural due process.</B>The mandated
    review by the board of parole within six months after the
    individual is committed and every year thereafter satisfies
    continuing procedural due process requirements. People v.
    White, 656 P.2d 690 (Colo. 1983); People v. Kibel, 701 P.2d 37
    (Colo. 1985).</P>
    <P>
    <B>An order of mandamus to require the parole board to place
    the defendant in a facility where he had access to sex offender
    treatment was properly denied.</B>This section gives the parole
    board discretion as to whether to order a transfer based upon
    the best interests of the inmate and public. Since an order of
    mandamus may only issue where the plaintiff establishes both a
    clear right to the relief sought and a clear duty on the part
    of the defendant to act, the court will not issue an order for
    relief that lies within the statutory discretion of the parole
    board. White v. Van Pelt, 55 P.3d 823 (Colo. App.
    2002).</P></ANNO-TEXT>

  <M>It is the policy of the general assembly that every public

  pursuant to the provisions of this part 3, to restrain, prevent,
  abate, and perpetually enjoin any such public nuisance and to
  seek the forfeiture of property as provided in this part 3. The
  general assembly intends that proceedings under this part 3 be
  remedial and equitable in nature. Nothing contained in this part
  3 shall be construed as an amendment or repeal of any of the
  criminal laws of this state, but the provisions of this part 3,
  insofar as they relate to those laws, shall be considered a
  cumulative right of the people in the enforcement of such laws.

  or control nuisances.</M>

    <P>
    <B>The purpose of the Colorado public nuisance statute</B>is to
    restrain, prevent, abate, and perpetually enjoin every public
    nuisance. People v. Garner, 732 P.2d 1194 (Colo. 1987).</P>
    <P>
    <B>The general assembly has declared that forfeiture
    proceedings of public nuisances are remedial and equitable in
    nature</B>and the trial court properly determined that
    intervenor acquired an equitable interest in the vehicle based
    upon his payment of $500. People v. One 1968 Chevrolet 2-Door,
    895 P.2d 1177 (Colo. App. 1995).</P>
    <P>
    <B>Purpose is the suppression of the unlawful
    nuisance.</B>Since the purpose of this part is not the
    infliction of punishment against the offender, that being left
    to the criminal law, but the suppression of the unlawful
    keeping, the claim that keeping a bawdy house is a criminal
    offense under the statute makes no difference and there can be
    no successful assault upon this part because it provides an
    action to enjoin the violation of a criminal statute. Gregg v.
    People, 65 Colo. 390, 176 P. 483 (1918) (decided under repealed
    laws antecedent to CSA, C 1, § 3).</P>
    <P>
    <B>The principle upon which forfeiture statutes are based</B>is
    that the property itself is the offender and may therefore be
    subject to forfeiture even though the owners of the property
    might be innocent of any wrongdoing. People v. Garner, 732 P.2d
    1194 (Colo. 1987).</P>
    <P>
    <B>Legislative intent was to divest owner of all legal title as
    of the date of seizure,</B>since otherwise the owner could
    alter the ownership rights prior to a final order under §
    16-13-309. United States v. Wilkinson, 686 P.2d 790 (Colo.

  shown to have been derived from any public nuisance act or for an
  amount shown to have been derived from a series of similar acts
  which fall within a pattern of public nuisance acts. The person

  of the alleged public nuisance act or acts;</M></P>
  <P N="(5)(c)(VI)">(VI)
  <M>Whether the person is silent or fails to call parties to

  <P N="(5)(c)(VII)">(VII)

  acquired the property was during the pendency or threat of

  threat of a forfeiture action;</M></P>
  <P N="(5)(c)(VIII)">(VIII)
  <M>Whether the placing of the title in the name of, or the

  purpose other than ownership of the property;</M></P>
  <P N="(5)(c)(IX)">(IX)
  <M>Whether the perpetrator of the alleged public nuisance act or

  determining whether a person is a true owner. A person contesting
  the forfeiture does not necessarily have to show that all of the
  factors enumerated in paragraph (c) of this subsection (5)
  support the claim of true ownership, nor does the person
  necessarily establish true ownership by showing the absence of
  fraudulent intent or badges of fraud.</M></P>

  division of motor vehicles in the department of revenue prior to
  the physical seizure of the vehicle and the recording of a notice
  of seizure, or the party attempting to assert standing has
  exclusive possession of the vehicle at the time of seizure. A

  resulting in a judgment of forfeiture in an action brought
  pursuant to this part 3, if the evidence presented raises an
  issue of proportionality under this paragraph (a.5), the
  defendant may petition the court to set a hearing, or the court
  may on its own motion set a hearing, to determine whether a

  shall be made prior to any sale or distribution of forfeited
  property.</M></P>
  <P N="(5.1)(a.5)(II)">(II)

  <M>The defendant shall have the burden of establishing by a

  <P N="(5.1)(a.5)(IV)">(IV)
  <M>If the court finds that the forfeiture is grossly
  disproportional to the public nuisance act and related criminal

  <P N="(5.1)(b)(II)(B)">(B)
  <M>Notwithstanding the provisions of sub-subparagraph (A) of this

  creating the public nuisance by certified mail; or</M></P>
  <P N="(5.2)(a)(II)">(II)
  <M>Upon learning of the conduct constituting a public nuisance,
  took reasonable action to prohibit such use of the property. An

  <P N="(5.2)(a)(II)(A)">(A)
  <M>Timely revoked or attempted to revoke permission for the
  persons engaging in such conduct to use the property; or</M></P>
  <P N="(5.2)(a)(II)(B)">(B)
  <M>Took reasonable action to discourage or prevent the use of the

  <P N="(5.2)(b)">(b)
  <M>With respect to a partial or whole ownership interest acquired
  after the conduct constituting a public nuisance has occurred,
  "innocent owner" means a person who, at the time he or she
  acquired the interest in the property, had no knowledge or notice
  that the illegal conduct subjecting the property to seizure had
  occurred or that the property had been seized for forfeiture,
  and:</M></P>
  <P N="(5.2)(b)(I)">(I)
  <M>Acquired an interest in the property in a bona fide

  <P N="(5.2)(b)(III)">(III)
  <M>Acquired an interest in the property through dissolution of
  marriage or by operation of law.</M></P>
  <P N="(5.2)(c)">(c)
  <M>An innocent owner's interest in property shall not be
  forfeited under any provision of state law. An innocent owner has
  the burden of proving by a preponderance of the evidence that he
  or she has an ownership interest in the subject property.
  Otherwise, the burden of proof under this subsection (5.2) shall
  be as provided in subsection (5.1) of this section.</M></P>
  <P N="(5.2)(d)">(d)
  <M>A person who is convicted of a criminal offense arising from

  <M>Whenever clear and convincing evidence adduced in an action
  pursuant to this part 3 shows a substantial connection between
  currency and the acts specified in subparagraph (I) of paragraph

  shall arise that said currency is property subject to forfeiture.
  A substantial connection exists if:</M></P>
  <P N="(6)(a)">(a)
  <M>Currency in the aggregate amount of one thousand dollars or
  more was seized at or close to the time that evidence of the acts

  <P N="(6)(b)(I)">(b)
  <N></N>(I)

  pursuant to subsection (6) of this section. However, when a
  preponderance of credible evidence is adduced to rebut a
  presumption that has arisen pursuant to subsection (6) of this

    <B>Two-pronged test</B>to determine whether a statutory
    forfeiture proceeding is essentially criminal in character for
    purposes of double jeopardy clause: (1) Whether general
    assembly expressly or impliedly indicated a preference for
    criminal or civil categorization; and (2) in the event the
    general assembly did indicate an intent to treat a forfeiture
    proceeding as civil, whether the statutory scheme is so
    punitive either in purpose or effect as to negate the
    legislative intention. People v. Milton, 732 P.2d 1199 (Colo.
    1987); People v. Ferrel, 929 P.2d 65 (Colo. App. 1996); People
    v. Coolidge, 953 P.2d 949 (Colo. App. 1997).</P>
    <P>
    <B>Forfeiture action pursuant to Colorado public nuisance
    statute</B>is essentially civil in nature, does not violate
    double jeopardy provisions of the constitution, and is not
    subject to constitutional or statutory speedy trial provisions
    applicable to criminal prosecutions. People v. Milton, 732 P.2d
    1199 (Colo. 1987).</P>
    <P>
    <B>Based upon the civil nature of civil forfeiture proceeding,
    defendant did not have a constitutional right to counsel</B>and
    ineffective assistance of counsel is not a basis for
    overturning the judgment of forfeiture. People v. Cobb, 944

    Sandstrom v. District Ct., 884 P.2d 707 (Colo. 1994).</P>
    <P>
    <B>The fact that statute defines a public nuisance</B>to
    include every vehicle used in the commission of any felony not
    otherwise included in the section did not transform forfeiture
    action into a criminal proceeding subject to double jeopardy
    provisions. People v. Milton, 732 P.2d 1199 (Colo. 1987).</P>
    <P>
    <B>Forfeiture action initiated under this section</B>did not
    violate the forfeiture of estate provision of section 9 of
    article II of the Colorado constitution. People v. Milton, 732
    P.2d 1199 (Colo. 1987).</P>
    <P>
    <B>Action for abatement of class 1 public nuisance is equitable
    in nature,</B>and while the court in the exercise of its equity
    powers may not act contrary to the statutory mandate, it does
    retain a considerable degree of discretion and flexibility in
    fashioning a decree which achieves a fair result, so that in
    forfeiture situation, the court retains the authority to
    protect the interest of an innocent party to the extent
    practicable and within the statutory dispositional
    alternatives. People v. Garner, 732 P.2d 1194 (Colo. 1987).</P>
    <P>
    <B>The general assembly has declared that forfeiture
    proceedings of public nuisances are remedial and equitable in
    nature</B>and the trial court properly determined that
    intervenor acquired an equitable interest in the vehicle based
    upon his payment of $500. People v. One 1968 Chevrolet 2-Door,
    895 P.2d 1177 (Colo. App. 1995).</P>
    <P>
    <B>Trial court's determination that party contesting the
    forfeiture was true owner of automobile was supported by
    evidence</B>because in its analysis of the totality of the
    circumstances, court considered intervenor's equitable
    interest, his good faith purchase for value without notice of
    the forfeiture, and the undue hardship laced on intervenor if
    the vehicle were forfeited. People v. One 1968 Chevrolet
    2-Door, 895 P.2d 1177 (Colo. App. 1995).</P>

    section makes reasonably clear to those intended to be affected
    what conduct is within its scope. People v. Perez, 192 Colo.
    562, 561 P.2d 7 (1977).</P>
    <P>
    <B>Property seized pursuant to this section is forfeited at the

    <B>Subsection (1)(c) is not unconstitutionally vague.</B>The
    language is specific, persons of common intelligence have no
    difficulty understanding the term "used" and in comprehending
    the definition of "controlled substance", and the language is
    sufficiently plain to give defendant and others reasonable
    notice of the kind of conduct prohibited by its terms. People

    class one public nuisance</B>on the basis of a single sale of a
    controlled substance which transpires within a vehicle. People
    v. One 1967 Pontiac (GTO), 678 P.2d 1016 (Colo. 1984).</P>
    <P>
    <B>No requirement of "close proximity" standard for forfeiture
    of contents of building declared a public nuisance.</B>Since
    forfeiture statute is a civil statute, once the people make a
    prima facie case that contents of a house were used in criminal
    activity, burden shifts to the owner of the property to show
    why it should not be seized. People v. Lot 23, 735 P.2d 184
    (Colo. 1987).</P>
    <P>
    <B>The use of the term "traceable" in subsection (3)(b) reveals
    legislative intent to require that a direct connection be
    established</B>between the alleged proceeds and the unlawful
    activity. People v. Cerrone, 780 P.2d 562 (Colo. App. 1989),
    cert. denied, 785 P.2d 917 (Colo. 1989).</P>
    <P>
    <B>The word "control" in subsection (6)(b)(II) encompasses any
    currency that is legally the property of the defendant, as well
    as any currency that the defendant has the authority or the
    power to manage or direct, even if such currency is not in the
    defendant's actual physical possession when it is
    seized.</B>Thus, it is the general assembly's intention that
    any currency seized from the control of a defendant who engaged
    in a drug-related public nuisance is presumptively forfeitable.
    People v. Thirty-Three Thousand Two Hundred and Twelve Dollars
    ($33,212.00) in U.S. Currency, 83 P.3d 1206 (Colo. App.
    2003).</P>
    <P>
    <B>The inclusion of subsection (1)(i) is a clear indication
    that the general assembly did not intend for the enumeration of
    specific felonies in the statute to be
    exhaustive.</B>Legislative history indicates that the general
    assembly did not intend to override the residual effect of
    subsection (1)(i) and omit felony theft from the statute's
    coverage. People v. One 1988 Mazda 323, 857 P.2d 569 (Colo.
    App. 1993).</P>
    <P>
    <B>Storage for purposes of statute</B>denotes that an item is
    left at a location for some period of time. It is not
    synonymous with possession. Generally the term indicates
    duration and not a transient situation. People v. One 1967 Ford
    Mustang, 781 P.2d 186 (Colo. App. 1989).</P>
    <P>
    <B>Vehicle used in the commission of a robbery</B>is a class 1
    public nuisance and the entire vehicle is subject to
    forfeiture, not just the contents of the vehicle. People v.
    Milton, 732 P.2d 1199 (Colo. 1987).</P>
    <P>
    <B>Motor vehicle used to transport stolen items home was not
    subject to forfeiture.</B>The stipulated facts and evidence
    presented were inadequate to prove that the motor vehicle was
    sufficiently connected to the thefts to allow forfeiture.
    People v. One 1988 Mazda 323, 857 P.2d 569 (Colo. App.
    1993).</P>
    <P>
    <B>This section requires the forfeiture of a vehicle</B>which
    has been determined to be a class 1 public nuisance when there
    is at least one owner of the vehicle who participated or
    acquiesced in the prohibited use which led to the vehicle being
    declared a public nuisance, notwithstanding the fact that a
    co-owner had no knowledge of or a role in the creation of the
    nuisance. People v. Garner, 732 P.2d 1194 (Colo. 1987).</P>
    <P>
    <B>Evidence showed only that defendant drove a vehicle to a
    location where marijuana was cultivated,</B>which would not
    compel every reasonable person to draw the inference that the
    vehicle was used in the manufacture, cultivation, growth,
    production, or processing of marijuana. People v. Wilson, 826
    P.2d 404 (Colo. App. 1992).</P>
    <P>
    <B>Forfeiture is proper</B>even though the vehicle was not used
    as a place where illegal activities were conducted. This
    section requires only that the vehicle was used to aid the
    illegal activity. People v. 1979 Volkswagen, 773 P.2d 619
    (Colo. App. 1989).</P>
    <P>
    <B>Summary judgment ordering forfeiture of real property, its
    contents, and currency was proper</B>where motion was supported
    by affidavits describing a history of sales and use of crack
    cocaine on the property by the defendant and her tenants, where
    the defendant admitted to making sales of crack cocaine on one
    of the parcels of property, and where repeated illegal drug use
    and sales took place on the property. People v. Cobb, 944 P.2d
    574 (Colo. App. 1996).</P>
    <P>
    <B>This section mitigates some of the harshness</B>inherent in
    the principle of forfeiture by exempting property from
    forfeiture if the court finds that the possession of the
    property is not unlawful and the owner was not a party to the
    creation of a nuisance and would suffer undue hardship by the
    sale, confiscation, or destruction of the property. People v.
    Garner, 732 P.2d 1194 (Colo. 1987).</P>
    <P>
    <B>There was no undue hardship by the confiscation and
    sale</B>of the fixtures and contents of the premises, which
    were being used for prostitution, where appellant knew of and
    profited from his deliberate illegal activity. People v. Perez,
    192 Colo. 562, 561 P.2d 7 (1977).</P>
    <P>
    <B>Burden of proof in forfeiture action</B>under Colorado
    public nuisance statute rests on the state and must be proven
    by a preponderance of the evidence. People v. Milton, 732 P.2d
    1199 (Colo. 1987).</P>
    <P>
    <B>The defendant need not be charged under the precise section
    defining solicitation of prostitution</B>in order for the
    provisions of the forfeiture section to apply. People v. 1979
    Volkswagen, 773 P.2d 619 (Colo. App. 1989).</P>
    <P>
    <B>Ample evidence in record</B>to support finding that business
    "was continuously being used as a place of prostitution".
    People v. Perez, 192 Colo. 562, 561 P.2d 7 (1977).</P>
    <P>
    <B>Former statute providing for abatement of houses of
    prostitution held valid.</B>Mongone v. People, 84 Colo. 516,

  this part 3. Such temporary restraining order shall:</M>

  <M>The temporary restraining order may make such provisions as

  a public nuisance temporary restraining order, including imposing
  those responsibilities on the owner or defendant, if said owner
  or defendant is allowed reasonable access to the property
  consistent with those limited purposes.</M></P>
  <P N="(1)(c)">(c)

  <P N="(1)(f)">(f)
  <M>Any person with an ownership interest adversely affected by a
  temporary restraining order issued pursuant to this subsection
  (1) may file a motion to vacate the temporary restraining order.
  Such motion shall be filed within fourteen days of the time said
  person is served with or otherwise has notice of the temporary
  restraining order. The motion shall be set for hearing within
  fourteen days after its filing. At said hearing, the court shall
  determine whether the various provisions of the temporary
  restraining order should remain in effect pending final
  determination of the action. No part of the temporary restraining
  order shall be vacated unless the proponent of the motion
  demonstrates that there is no probable cause to believe that a
  public nuisance exists or that the public nuisance acts
  underlying the action occurred, or that the proponent has a
  reasonable likelihood of prevailing on the merits of the case
  with respect to the temporary seizure or closure of the property.
  No issue regarding the forfeiture of the property shall be raised
  at the hearing on the motion, except the court may consider an
  innocent owner defense pursuant to section 16-13-303 (5.2) by a
  proponent who has not been charged in a parallel criminal action
  arising from the same activity giving rise to the forfeiture
  proceedings. When the innocent owner defense is raised as grounds
  for vacating the order, the issues at the hearing shall be
  limited to modifying the order to provide for the use of the
  property during the pendency of the action by an innocent owner,
  but only if such use is consistent with preserving it for
  forfeiture as to any other interest. Such a modifying order may
  include, without limitation, reasonable provisions for the
  continued occupancy of a residence, or the operation of a
  business and the sale or disposition of business inventory.
  However, no such modifying order shall include the release of
  currency. The determination of the facts by the court at the
  hearing is independent of and shall not be considered in the
  determination of the same or similar facts in the adjudication of
  any criminal charges arising out of the same occurrences. Any
  motion to vacate a temporary restraining order shall state
  specifically the factual and legal grounds upon which it is
  based, and only those grounds may be considered at the hearing.
  Until vacated, the temporary restraining order shall remain in
  full force and effect.</M></P>
  <P N="(2)">(2)
  <M>In an action to abate a class 2 public nuisance, the court
  may, as a part of a preliminary injunction, direct the sheriff to

  order of the court. While the preliminary injunction remains in
  effect, the building or place seized and closed, and all personal
  property seized thereunder, shall be subject to the orders of the
  court.</M></P>
  <P N="(3)">(3)
  <M>Temporary restraining orders and preliminary injunctions for
  public nuisances other than class 1 public nuisances may be

  <M>If the owner of a building, a place, or any real property
  seized and closed as a class 1 public nuisance has not been
  guilty of any contempt of court in the proceedings, and appears
  and pays all costs, fees, and allowances which are declared by
  this section to be a lien on the building, place, or real
  property, and files a bond in the amount fixed by the court not
  to exceed the full value of said property, with sureties to be
  approved by the court, conditioned that he will immediately abate
  any such nuisance that exists at the building, place, or real
  property and prevent the same from being established or kept
  thereat within a period of one year thereafter, the court, if
  satisfied of his good faith and satisfied that such owner had not
  conducted, used, maintained, or knowingly permitted the
  conducting, using, or maintaining of such public nuisance, may
  order the building, place, or real property to be delivered to
  said owner and the order of abatement canceled so far as the same
  relates to said property. If any property is found not to be a
  public nuisance pursuant to this part 3 or if said property fits
  the description of property specified in section 16-13-303 (2)
  and (3) and the property is not subject to forfeiture or an
  affirmative defense has been proven, said property shall be
  released to the owner without conditions. The release of the

  been abated and will not recur, the court may order the premises
  delivered to the owner or operator. As a condition of such order,
  the court may require the posting of bond, in an amount fixed by
  the court, for the faithful performance of the obligation of the

  property or interest was secret, concealed, undisclosed, hurried,
  or not in the usual mode of doing business;</M></P>
  <P N="(2)(c)(IV)">(IV)

  alter ego, nominee, or fictitious party;</M></P>
  <P N="(2)(c)(V)">(V)
  <M>Whether the person is a relative, a co-conspirator,
  complicitor, or an accessory in the public nuisance act or acts
  or other criminal activity, a business associate in a legal or
  illegal business, one who maintains a special or close
  relationship with, or an insider with respect to the perpetrator
  of the alleged public nuisance act or acts;</M></P>
  <P N="(2)(c)(VI)">(VI)
  <M>Whether the person is silent or fails to call parties to

  acquired the property was during the pendency or threat of

  known, or had notice of the public nuisance act or acts or the
  threat of a forfeiture action;</M></P>
  <P N="(2)(c)(VIII)">(VIII)
  <M>Whether the placing of the title in the name of, or the

  <M>Whether the perpetrator of the alleged public nuisance act or

  conveyances.</M></P>
  <P N="(2)(d)">(d)
  <M>The court shall consider the totality of the circumstances in
  determining whether a person is a true owner. A person contesting
  the forfeiture does not necessarily have to show that all of the
  factors enumerated in paragraph (c) of this subsection (2)
  support the claim of true ownership, nor does the person
  necessarily establish true ownership by showing the absence of
  fraudulent intent or badges of fraud.</M></P>

  forfeiture thereof, unless the title to the motor vehicle, with
  transfer duly executed to the party, has been filed with the
  division of motor vehicles in the department of revenue prior to
  the physical seizure of the vehicle and the recording of a notice
  of seizure, or the party attempting to assert standing has
  exclusive possession of the vehicle at the time of seizure. A
  party eligible to assert standing under this paragraph (e) must
  nevertheless establish that the party is a true owner of the
  vehicle or has an interest therein pursuant to paragraph (c) of
  this subsection (2).</M></P>
  <P N="(2)(f)">(f)

  <M>Legislative declaration.</M></CATCH-LINE>The general assembly
  hereby finds that persons who are convicted of offenses involving
  unlawful sexual behavior and who are identified as sexually
  violent predators pose a high enough level of risk to the
  community that persons in the community should receive
  notification concerning the identity of these sexually violent
  predators. The general assembly also recognizes the high
  potential for vigilantism that often results from community
  notification and the dangerous potential that the fear of such
  vigilantism will drive a sex offender to disappear and attempt to
  live without supervision. The general assembly therefore finds
  that sex offender notification should only occur in cases
  involving a high degree of risk to the community and should only
  occur under carefully controlled circumstances that include
  providing additional information and education to the community
  concerning supervision and treatment of sex
  offenders.</SECTION-TEXT>

    <B>Prospective challenge.</B>Prospectively, and not
    retroactively, a prisoner subject to a detainer under the
    interstate agreement on detainers will have the right to
    challenge the procedures to determine whether the interstate
    compact and the uniform act have been complied with. Moen v.
    Wilson, 189 Colo. 85, 536 P.2d 1129 (1975). 
    <P>
    <B>Act implements speedy trial right.</B>The uniform act is one
    of several Colorado statutes implementing a defendant's right
    to a speedy trial as provided in § 16 of art. II, Colo. Const.
    People v. Bean, 650 P.2d 565 (Colo. 1982); People v. Lewis, 680
    P.2d 226 (Colo. 1984).</P>
    <P>
    <B>Rights under the act.</B>All rights under the act are
    statutorily and not constitutionally based; thus, waiver of
    them must be voluntary but need not be knowing and intelligent.
    People v. Martin, 707 P.2d 1005 (Colo. App. 1985), aff'd, 738
    P.2d 789 (Colo. 1987).</P>
    <P>
    <B>The purpose of the Uniform Mandatory Disposition of
    Detainers Act (UMDDA)</B>is to provide a mechanism for the
    disposition of detainers; without a detainer, the act has no
    applicability. People v. Bolin, 712 P.2d 1002 (Colo. 1986).</P>
    <P>The primary purpose of the UMDDA and the Interstate
    Agreement on Detainers (IAD) is to provide a mechanism for
    prisoners to insist upon speedy and final disposition of
    untried charges that are the subjects of detainers so that a
    prisoner's speedy trial rights and any prison rehabilitation
    programs initiated for the prisoners' benefit will not be
    disrupted or precluded by the existence of these untried
    charges. People v. Higinbotham, 712 P.2d 993 (Colo. 1986);
    People v. Naulls, 937 P.2d 778 (Colo. App. 1996).</P>
    <P>
    <B>Policies of IAD and this article are similar.</B>People v.
    Bean, 44 Colo. App. 373, 619 P.2d 72 (1980), rev'd on other
    grounds, 650 P.2d 565 (Colo. 1982).</P>
    <P>
    <B>The IAD and the UMDDA embody like policies,</B>and,
    generally, the principles of one may be applied to the other.
    People v. Morgan, 712 P.2d 1004 (Colo. 1986); Sweaney v.
    District Court, 713 P.2d 914 (Colo. 1986).</P>
    <P>
    <B>Policy same as § 18-1-405 and Crim. P. 48.</B>The policies
    underlying § 18-1-405 and Crim. P. 48 are the same as those
    relative to the uniform act. People v. Lopez, 41 Colo. App.
    206, 587 P.2d 792 (1978); People v. Boos, 199 Colo. 15, 604
    P.2d 272 (1979).</P>
    <P>
    <B>In determining whether to dismiss charges</B>for lack of
    prompt notification, a court must consider more than the
    general factors underlying the constitutional right to a speedy
    trial because the UMDDA effectuates other policies besides the
    speedy trial rights. People v. Higinbotham, 712 P.2d 993 (Colo.
    1986).</P>
    <P>A defendant is entitled to the dismissal of charges against
    him that underlie a detainer as a sanction for violation of the
    prompt notification requirement of § 16-14-102 (2) of the
    uniform act unless the prosecution can demonstrate a lack of
    prejudice to the defendant resulting from that violation.
    People v. Higinbotham, 712 P.2d 993 (Colo. 1986); People v.
    Glasser, 293 P.3d 68 (Colo. App. 2011).</P>
    <P>In the absence of an express statutory sanction for
    violation of the prompt notification requirement, automatic
    dismissal is not required as a remedy for such a violation.
    People v. Higinbotham, 712 P.2d 993 (Colo. 1986).</P>
    <P>
    <B>Failure to hold trial within prescribed time period requires
    dismissal of charges.</B>This article by its express terms is
    jurisdictional, hence dismissal is required regardless of
    whether defendant was prejudiced by the delay. People v.
    Naulls, 937 P.2d 778 (Colo. App. 1996).</P></ANNO-TEXT>

    <B>Provisions similar to interstate agreement on detainers
    (IAD).</B>Provisions in this article mandating that prison
    authorities "forthwith" furnish the certified statement and
    request, and directing that failure to comply with the
    specified time requirements for commencing trial will result in
    dismissal, are almost identical to the analogous provision in
    the IAD. People v. Bean, 44 Colo. App. 373, 619 P.2d 72 (1980),
    rev'd on other grounds, 650 P.2d 565 (Colo. 1982). 
    <P>
    <B>The Uniform Mandatory Disposition of Detainers Act (UMDDA)
    and the IAD embody like policies</B>and, generally, the
    principles of one may be applied to the other. People v.
    Morgan, 712 P.2d 1004 (Colo. 1986); Sweaney v. District Court,
    713 P.2d 914 (Colo. 1986).</P>

    <B>Failure to hold trial within prescribed time period requires
    dismissal of charges.</B>This article by its express terms is
    jurisdictional, hence dismissal is required regardless of
    whether defendant was prejudiced by the delay. People v.
    Naulls, 937 P.2d 778 (Colo. App. 1996).</P>
    <P>
    <B>The general speedy trial statute, § 18-1-405, and not this
    act, applies</B>to the retrial of charges on convictions
    overturned on appeal. The UMDDA applies only to untried
    charges, and the charges against this defendant, while still
    pending, were not untried. People v. Campbell, 885 P.2d 327
    (Colo. App. 1994).</P>
    <P>
    <B>Filing of detainer not required.</B>The right of a person in
    the custody of the department of corrections to request final
    disposition of criminal charges and thereby to obtain a right
    to trial within 90 days on those charges is not dependent upon
    the filing of a detainer. People v. Campbell, 742 P.2d 302
    (Colo. 1987); People v. Trancoso, 776 P.2d 374 (Colo.
    1989).</P>
    <P>
    <B>Sufficiency of request.</B>Addressing the request for
    disposition to the chief judge of the appropriate court
    constitutes substantial compliance within the requirement that
    the defendant give the court notice that he wishes to invoke
    the provisions of the act. People v. Campbell, 742 P.2d 302
    (Colo. 1987).</P>
    <P>A prisoner's written request for disposition under this act,
    when sent to the superintendent, is sufficient to satisfy the
    requirements of this section. A prisoner's rights under this
    act cannot be defeated by the superintendent's failure to
    comply with his statutory duties under § 16-14-103. People v.
    Trancoso, 776 P.2d 374 (Colo. 1989).</P>
    <P>
    <B>Court did not err in denying consideration of defendant's
    request for final disposition</B>when defendant improperly
    mailed the request directly to the court and no evidence
    existed that the superintendent or prosecutor ever received the
    request. People v. Adolf, 2012 COA 60, 296 P.3d 251.</P>
    <P>
    <B>Prison authorities must have "actual knowledge" of charges
    against a prisoner</B>before a duty arises to promptly inform
    the prisoner of such charges. People v. Lewis, 680 P.2d 226
    (Colo. 1984).</P>
    <P>
    <B>Mere awareness that charges are pending against an
    inmate</B>in another jurisdiction does not trigger the
    superintendent's duty to inform the defendant of his rights
    under this article. People v. Yellen, 704 P.2d 306 (Colo.
    1985), cert. denied, 474 U.S. 1036, 106 S. Ct. 603, 88 L. Ed.
    2d 582 (1985).</P>
    <P>
    <B>A superintendent only has "knowledge" of an untried charge
    when a detainer has been filed.</B>People v. Yellen, 704 P.2d

    <P>
    <B>A person on parole is in custody of department of
    corrections</B>for purposes of this section. People v. Gess,
    250 P.3d 734 (Colo. App. 2010).</P>
    <P>
    <B>Revocation of parole not required for custody.</B>A person
    placed on parole remains in the legal custody of the department
    of corrections and, therefore, revocation of parole is not
    required to invoke the protection of the uniform act. People v.
    Campbell, 742 P.2d 302 (Colo. 1987).</P>
    <P>
    <B>Where defendant was in jail for a parole
    violation,</B>defendant, for purposes of this section, was
    considered to be in the custody of the department of
    corrections while in county jail. People v. Slusher, 43 P.3d
    647 (Colo. App. 2001).</P>
    <P>
    <B>An outstanding arrest warrant</B>for a prisoner is not an
    indictment, information, or criminal complaint and, therefore,
    does not trigger application of notice and speedy trial
    provisions of the uniform act. People v. Gonzales, 679 P.2d
    1085 (Colo. 1984).</P>
    <P>
    <B>The existence of an untried indictment, information, or
    criminal complaint is necessary before a criminal may invoke
    the UMDDA procedural protection.</B>A petition for a speedy
    disposition that predates the filing of an indictment,
    information, or complaint is a nullity with no legal effect on
    subsequently filed felony charges. People v. Calhoon, 897 P.2d
    855 (Colo. App. 1994).</P>
    <P>
    <B>The UMDDA applies to all of a prisoner's untried
    charges,</B>not just charges that occurred before
    incarceration. People v. Gess, 250 P.3d 734 (Colo. App.
    2010).</P>
    <P>
    <B>A writing that makes a claim under the UMDDA must not be
    misleadingly labeled as a motion for habeas corpus relief and
    must be sent to both the court and prosecution.</B>People v.
    Gess, 250 P.3d 734 (Colo. App. 2010).</P>
    <P>
    <B>Defendant's request for a UMDDA trial was
    insufficient</B>because it was one sentence in a four-page
    document filed pro se by defendant who was represented by
    counsel, the document was misleadingly labeled, and it was
    improperly delivered. People v. Roberts, 2013 COA 50, 321 P.3d
    581.</P>
    <P>
    <B>Prisoner cured defects in original UMDDA claim</B>by filing
    a written motion with the court and asking the court to dismiss
    the charges at a subsequent hearing at which the prosecution
    was present. People v. Gess, 250 P.3d 734 (Colo. App.
    2010).</P>
    <P>
    <B>Notice of detainer.</B>The prosecution has the burden of
    proving that a defendant is not prejudiced, as measured against
    the purposes of the uniform act, by the failure on the part of
    the superintendent of the institution in which the prisoner is
    confined to inform the defendant promptly of the existence of
    the detainer and of the defendant's rights, as required by
    subsection (2). People v. Higinbotham, 712 P.2d 993 (Colo.
    1986).</P>
    <P>The appropriate measure for determining the imposition of a
    sanction for violations of subsection (2) properly begins with
    an examination of purposes furthered by the UMDDA. People v.
    Higinbotham, 712 P.2d 993 (Colo. 1986).</P>
    <P>A violation of the prompt notification requirement in
    subsection (2) does not mandate an automatic dismissal of the
    charges against a defendant. People v. Higinbotham, 712 P.2d
    993 (Colo. 1986).</P>
    <P>There is no reason in the language or purpose of the statute
    to require that a prisoner request final disposition of a
    charge as a condition precedent to filing a motion to dismiss
    the charge because of an alleged violation of the prompt
    notification requirement of subsection (2). People v.
    Higinbotham, 712 P.2d 993 (Colo. 1986).</P>
    <P>A superintendent's obligation to inform a prisoner pursuant
    to subsection (2) does not arise until a detainer has in fact
    been filed; "knowledge" of untried charges for the purposes of
    subsection (2) does not occur until a detainer has been filed.
    People v. Bolin, 712 P.2d 1002 (Colo. 1986).</P>
    <P>If a detainer is never filed, then a superintendent's duty
    required by § 16-14-102 (2) does not arise. People v. Morgan,
    712 P.2d 1004 (Colo. 1986).</P>
    <P>
    <B>Violation of the provisions of subsection (3) does not
    automatically deprive the court of jurisdiction.</B>It does
    entitle the prisoner to dismissal of the charges, regardless of
    whether he or she suffered any prejudice from the delay in
    notification. But defendant could not overcome the time bar
    imposed by § 16-5-402 on the basis that his motion alleged a
    jurisdictional defect. People v. Slusher, 43 P.3d 647 (Colo.
    App. 2001).</P>
    <P>
    <B>Statute as basis for jurisdiction.</B>See Buffalo v.
    Tanksley, 189 Colo. 45, 536 P.2d 827 (1975).</P>
    <P>
    <B>The procedural requirements of the UMDDA and the IAD do not
    apply</B>to a detainer placing a hold on a prisoner based on an
    unresolved sentencing determination in another jurisdiction
    where the defendant has already been convicted on the charges.
    Moody v. Corsentino, 843 P.2d 1355 (Colo. 1993).</P>
    <P>
    <B>Time constraints of this section were not applicable to
    prosecution's motion to revoke deferred judgment and sentence
    where defendant's guilty plea had previously been accepted by
    the court.</B>The phrase "untried indictment, information, or
    complaint" as used in this section does not apply to those
    situations in which a defendant has entered a guilty plea and
    the sentence is deferred. People v. Hastings, 903 P.2d 23
    (Colo. App. 1994).</P>
    <P>
    <B>The provisions of this article govern intrastate
    detainers,</B>which involve prisoners in the custody of the
    department of corrections in Colorado who have Colorado charges
    pending against them and the provisions of § 24-60-501, govern
    interstate detainers, filed by a compact state that has charges
    pending against a person imprisoned in another compact state.

    <B>Burden of establishing that request was "forthwith"

    <B>Notice of detainer.</B>The prosecution has the burden of
    proving that a defendant is not prejudiced, as measured against
    the purposes of the uniform act, by the failure on the part of
    the superintendent of the institution in which the prisoner is
    confined to inform the defendant promptly of the existence of a
    detainer and of the defendant's rights, as required by §
    16-14-102 (2). People v. Higinbotham, 712 P.2d 993 (Colo.
    1986).</P>
    <P>Neither classification reviews or transportation orders
    constitute a "detainer" sufficient to trigger a

    and nature of untried indictment, information, or criminal
    complaint against such prisoner. People v. Morgan, 712 P.2d
    1004 (Colo. 1986).</P>
    <P>A superintendent's obligation to inform a prisoner pursuant
    to § 16-14-102 (2) does not arise until a detainer has in fact
    been filed; "knowledge" of untried charges for the purposes of
    § 16-14-102 (2) does not occur until a detainer has been filed.
    People v. Bolin, 712 P.2d 1002 (Colo. 1986).</P>
    <P>Where defendant suffered no prejudice from superintendent's
    delay in sending copy of request to trial court and prosecutor,
    dismissal of charges is not warranted. Martin v. People, 738

    <P>
    <B>Superintendent's duties are invoked by prisoner's
    request.</B>The superintendent's duties under this section are
    invoked whenever a prisoner's request under § 16-14-102 (1) is
    delivered to the superintendent, notwithstanding the absence of
    a detainer lodged against the prisoner. People v. Trancoso, 776

    <B>Purpose of act.</B>The uniform act is intended to render
    constitutional guarantees of speedy trial more effective.
    People v. Anderson, 649 P.2d 720 (Colo. App. 1982). 
    <P>
    <B>The general speedy trial statute, § 18-1-405, and not this
    act, applies</B>to the retrial of charges on convictions
    overturned on appeal. The Uniform Mandatory Disposition of
    Detainers Act (UMDDA) applies only to untried charges, and the
    charges against this defendant, while still pending, were not
    untried. People v. Campbell, 885 P.2d 327 (Colo. App.
    1994).</P>
    <P>
    <B>This section applies only when the defendant is in the
    custody of the department of corrections.</B>Where, at time of
    request for speedy trial, defendant was incarcerated in a
    county jail in Mississippi, and his deferred sentence was not
    yet revoked, 90-day time limit did not apply. People v.
    McPherson, 897 P.2d 923 (Colo. App. 1995).</P>
    <P>
    <B>The issue of physical custody is irrelevant when determining
    the applicability of the UMDDA.</B>People v. Carr, 205 P.3d 471
    (Colo. App. 2008).</P>
    <P>
    <B>Prisoner's right to invoke procedural protection of
    UMDDA</B>depends on the existence of formal charges at the time
    UMDDA request is filed. Consequently, petition for a speedy
    disposition that predates the filing of an indictment,
    information, or complaint is a nullity with no legal effect on
    subsequently filed felony charges. People v. Dehmer, 931 P.2d
    460 (Colo. App. 1996).</P>
    <P>
    <B>Prisoner may challenge his or her conviction on UMDDA
    grounds even if he or she pled guilty.</B>A trial court loses
    jurisdiction if it fails to comply with this section, and that
    defect is not waived by a subsequent guilty plea. People v.
    Gess, 250 P.3d 734 (Colo. App. 2010); People v. Yakas, 2019 COA
    117, 461 P.3d 568.</P>
    <P>
    <B>Provisions similar to interstate agreement on
    detainers.</B>Provisions in this article mandating that prison
    authorities "forthwith" furnish the certified statement and
    request, and directing that failure to comply with the
    specified time requirements for commencing trial will result in
    dismissal, are almost identical to the analogous provision in
    the interstate agreement on detainers. People v. Bean, 44 Colo.
    App. 373, 619 P.2d 72 (1980), rev'd on other grounds, 650 P.2d
    565 (Colo. 1982).</P>
    <P>
    <B>Article controls over general speedy trial
    provisions.</B>This article is a special statute designed to
    foster more effective prisoner treatment and rehabilitation;
    thus, when there is a conflict with the general speedy trial
    provisions, §§ 16-14-101 et seq., 18-1-405, and 24-60-501 et
    seq., and Crim. P. 48, the provisions of this article control.
    People v. Swazo, 199 Colo. 486, 610 P.2d 1072 (1980).</P>
    <P>
    <B>Defendant's request for a UMDDA trial was
    insufficient</B>because it was one sentence in a four-page
    document filed pro se by defendant who was represented by
    counsel, the document was misleadingly labeled, and it was
    improperly delivered. People v. Roberts, 2013 COA 50, 321 P.3d
    581.</P>
    <P>
    <B>Continuance and its length determined by circumstances of
    case.</B>The peculiar circumstances of each case are
    significant factors in providing guidance for the trial court
    in determining what must be shown to obtain a continuance or
    determine its length under the provisions of this article.
    People v. Swazo, 199 Colo. 486, 610 P.2d 1072 (1980); People v.
    Fleming, 867 P.2d 119 (Colo. App. 1993), rev'd on other
    grounds, 900 P.2d 19 (Colo. 1995).</P>
    <P>The trial court's judgment regarding whether a continuance
    should be granted may be reversed on appeal only if there has
    been an abuse of discretion. People v. Fleming, 867 P.2d 119
    (Colo. App. 1993), rev'd on other grounds, 900 P.2d 19 (Colo.
    1995).</P>
    <P>
    <B>When dismissal of charges proper.</B>Where a prisoner has
    substantially complied with the provisions of this article and
    the prosecution has actual notice of the prisoner's request, it
    is not an abuse of discretion for the trial court to dismiss
    pending charges under the article. The court shall dismiss the
    charges with the prejudice if the prisoner complies with the
    act and the cause is not brought to trial within 90 days.
    People v. Mascarenas, 666 P.2d 101 (Colo. 1983).</P>
    <P>
    <B>For purposes of the UMDDA, "actual notice" means "actual
    knowledge".</B>Merely sending a substantially compliant UMDDA
    request to the prosecution does not suffice to provide "actual
    notice". People v. McKimmy, 2014 CO 76, 338 P.3d 348.</P>
    <P>
    <B>Failure to hold trial within prescribed time period requires
    dismissal of charges.</B>This article by its express terms is
    jurisdictional, hence dismissal is required regardless of
    whether defendant was prejudiced by the delay. People v.
    Naulls, 937 P.2d 778 (Colo. App. 1996).</P>
    <P>
    <B>Statutory period commences to run upon receipt of request,
    not upon subsequent hearing.</B>The 90-day statutory period
    commences to run upon receipt by county judge and district
    attorney's office of request for speedy trial under provisions
    of the uniform act, and not on date subsequent preliminary
    hearing. People v. Boos, 199 Colo. 15, 604 P.2d 272 (1979).</P>
    <P>
    <B>Proper sanction for failure to comply</B>with this article
    is dismissal of the claims with prejudice. People v. Bean, 650
    P.2d 565 (Colo. 1982).</P>
    <P>
    <B>Imposition of sanction.</B>The prosecutor should have the
    burden of establishing lack of prejudice in order to avoid a
    sanction of dismissal for violation of any provision of the
    uniform act for which dismissal has not been mandated by the
    legislature. People v. Higinbotham, 712 P.2d 993 (Colo.
    1986).</P>
    <P>The appropriate measure for determining the imposition of a
    sanction for violations of § 16-14-102 (2) properly begins with
    an examination of purposes furthered by the UMDDA. People v.
    Higinbotham, 712 P.2d 993 (Colo. 1986).</P>
    <P>
    <B>Filing of detainer not required.</B>The right of a person in
    the custody of the department of corrections to request final
    disposition of criminal charges and thereby to obtain a right
    to trial within 90 days on those charges is not dependent upon
    the filing of a detainer. People v. Campbell, 742 P.2d 302
    (Colo. 1987).</P>
    <P>
    <B>Where there was no action on part of defendant when trial
    was rescheduled</B>to a time outside the applicable statutory
    time limit, there was no waiver of his rights under the uniform
    act. People v. Lopez, 41 Colo. App. 206, 587 P.2d 792
    (1978).</P>
    <P>
    <B>Where criminal proceeding initiated by filing criminal
    complaint in county court,</B>a request for disposition of
    detainer filed in the county court commences the running of the
    90-day statutory period provided for in this section. People v.
    Lopez, 41 Colo. App. 206, 587 P.2d 792 (1978).</P>
    <P>
    <B>Disposition within 90 days waived.</B>Failure of defendant's
    counsel to object to the trial date announced and to request an
    earlier date along with his statement as to availability on the
    date announced by the court and his affirmative request for a
    pretrial date to accommodate his convenience all amounted to
    consent to the date and waiver of the specified 90 days
    subsequent to the request for detainer disposition. Chambers v.
    District Court, 180 Colo. 241, 504 P.2d 340 (1972); People v.
    Kimble, 692 P.2d 1142 (Colo. App. 1984), cert. granted, 697
    P.2d 716 (Colo.), cert. dismissed, 701 P.2d 17 (Colo.
    1985).</P>
    <P>Defendant voluntarily waived his objection that his request
    for final disposition of detainer was not transferred
    "forthwith" to the trial court when he and his attorney
    acquiesced freely in a trial date beyond the speedy trial
    period. People v. Martin, 707 P.2d 1005 (Colo. App. 1985).</P>
    <P>
    <B>Defendant's speedy trial right was violated, and there was
    no waiver of rights under this section by accepting a trial
    date outside the 180-day speedy trial period.</B>Defendant's
    acquiescence in the trial date proposed by the court did not
    meet the express waiver requirements of subsection (2). The
    court did not advise defendant that his assent to the trial
    date would constitute a waiver of his speedy trial right, and
    defendant did not expressly waive his speedy trial right on the
    record. Further, the UMDDA advisement form attached to
    defendant's pro se request for speedy disposition did not
    advise him that agreement to a trial date set beyond the
    180-day limitations period would constitute an implied waiver
    of his rights under the UMDDA. People v. Carr, 205 P.3d 471
    (Colo. App. 2008).</P>
    <P>
    <B>Waiver of rights by participation in trial setting
    delays.</B>A defendant effectively waives his rights to final
    disposition within the 90-day statutory limitation period by
    his active participation in trial setting delays and in his
    agreement to the appropriate dates. People v. Mascarenas, 666
    P.2d 101 (Colo. 1983); People v. Martin, 707 P.2d 1005 (Colo.
    App. 1985).</P>
    <P>A defendant may waive his right to a final disposition
    within the 90-day statutory period by express waiver, or
    affirmative conduct evidencing such a waiver, such as active
    participation in trial setting delays, together with agreement
    to the appropriate dates. People v. Martinez, 712 P.2d 1070
    (Colo. App. 1985).</P>
    <P>Extension of the 90-day time limit does not require the
    defendant's personal consent. The limit was effectively tolled
    where the judge granted a continuation for the defendant's
    benefit because the prosecution was ready to proceed, but the
    defense counsel was not present. People v. Fleming, 900 P.2d 19
    (Colo. 1995).</P>
    <P>
    <B>A defendant's UMDDA rights can be waived by either the
    defendant or counsel.</B>The rights under the UMDDA are not
    fundamental rights requiring personal waiver by the defendant.
    Rather, the rights are statutory and the statute does not
    require waiver by the defendant. People v. Yakas, 2019 COA 117,
    461 P.3d 568.</P>
    <P>Counsel's waiver, in defendant's presence, of the required
    advisement was a valid waiver of defendant's UMDDA rights.
    People v. Yakas, 2019 COA 117, 461 P.3d 568.</P>
    <P>
    <B>When defendant wanted to be represented by counsel and
    counsel could not be prepared by the end of the speedy trial
    deadline, the court did not err</B>in giving defendant the
    choice between waiving his right to a speedy trial or the right
    to be represented by effective counsel. People v. Bryant, 2013
    COA 28, 316 P.3d 18.</P>
    <P>
    <B>Defendant not entitled to relief</B>because defendant's
    actions of hiring new counsel and then subsequently firing that
    counsel and representing himself, both of which required a
    continuance, tolled the 180-day deadline. People v. Gess, 250
    P.3d 734 (Colo. App. 2010).</P>
    <P>
    <B>Defendant's speedy trial claim was invalidated by tolling
    the speedy requirement within 90 days even though trial was not
    originally set within 90 days.</B>Defendant's motion for a
    court-appointed expert tolled his speedy trial rights and
    defendant then expressly waived his speedy trial right at the
    hearing granting a court-appointed expert. People v. Garcia, 17
    P.3d 820 (Colo. App. 2000).</P>
    <P>
    <B>Defendant's request for a continuance of the trial date to
    allow defense counsel more time to prepare tolled the 90-day
    time period for trial.</B>People v. Shreck, 107 P.3d 1048
    (Colo. App. 2004).</P>
    <P>
    <B>The 90-day time period was tolled where defendant
    contributed to the delay</B>by not telling his counsel that he
    had requested final disposition and the date for completion of
    the 90-day period. People v. Fleming, 900 P.2d 19 (Colo.
    1995).</P>
    <P>
    <B>Where a defendant permits a jury trial to proceed to a
    guilty verdict,</B>there is a waiver of the act's benefits as a
    matter of law. People v. Kimble, 692 P.2d 1142 (Colo. App.
    1984), cert. granted, 697 P.2d 716 (Colo.), cert. dismissed,
    701 P.2d 17 (Colo. 1985).</P>
    <P>
    <B>Waiver may be of limited scope and duration.</B>Trial court
    erred in construing such a waiver as broad and perpetual.
    People v. Naulls, 937 P.2d 778 (Colo. App. 1996).</P>
    <P>
    <B>Time extended by motions for defendant's benefit.</B>Where
    additional time is necessitated by motions made for defendant's
    benefit, and reasonable continuances are ordered by the trial
    court to accommodate defendant's motions, the time for bringing
    defendant to trial under the uniform act may be extended.
    People v. Anderson, 649 P.2d 720 (Colo. App. 1982).</P>
    <P>
    <B>Attorney may request continuance without client's
    approval.</B>An attorney may stipulate to or request a
    continuance without obtaining his client's personal approval.
    People v. Anderson, 649 P.2d 720 (Colo. App. 1982).</P>
    <P>No abuse of court's discretion in determining that good
    cause existed for granting continuance upon defense counsel's
    assertion that he would be unable to provide defendant with
    effective assistance if required to go to trial on the
    scheduled date. People v. Roberts, 2013 COA 50, 321 P.3d
    581.</P>
    <P>Second continuance was necessary to protect defendant's
    constitutional right to effective assistance of counsel, and
    the length of the continuance was proper because of recent
    disclosure by prosecution, because a potential conflict of
    interest existed, and because good cause existed for
    substitution of counsel. People v. Roberts, 2013 COA 50, 321
    P.3d 581.</P>
    <P>
    <B>Continuance held to be for good cause.</B>Defense counsel's
    unanticipated military obligations made adequate trial
    preparation impossible. People v. Anderson, 649 P.2d 720 (Colo.
    App. 1982).</P>
    <P>
    <B>No abuse of discretion in finding good cause for the
    continuance,</B>even if good cause required a showing of due
    diligence, when prosecution failed to subpoena a cooperating
    witness and defendant did not object to continuing the trial
    date beyond the UMDDA deadline. People v. Hines, 2021 COA 45,
    491 P.3d 578.</P>
    <P>
    <B>Delay to get preliminary hearing not "good cause".</B>Delay
    which results from a period of time required by the state in
    order to get a preliminary hearing is not "good cause" for the
    granting of a continuance. People v. Lopez, 41 Colo. App. 206,
    587 P.2d 792 (1978).</P>
    <P>
    <B>Delay not for good cause.</B>Fact that co-defendant who was
    not subject to UMDDA had trial set for date after 90-day period
    is not good cause for delaying defendant's trial. People v.
    Mueller, 851 P.2d 211 (Colo. App. 1992).</P>
    <P>
    <B>Defendant did not expressly waive on the record his right to
    a speedy disposition under the UMDDA.</B>Defendant was at all
    times adamant about being tried within the 180-day period.
    Consequently, the court erred in determining that defendant had
    waived any UMDDA rights. People v. Roberts, 2013 COA 50, 321
    P.3d 581.</P>
    <P>
    <B>There is no untried "indictment, information, or complaint"
    where the defendant has been convicted but not
    sentenced.</B>Thus, the provisions of the UMDDA and the
    Interstate Agreement on Detainers will not apply to sentencing
    detainers. Moody v. Corsentino, 843 P.2d 1355 (Colo. 1993).</P>
    <P>An outstanding arrest warrant is not an "indictment,
    information, or criminal complaint" which triggers the
    application of this section. People v. McPherson, 897 P.2d 923
    (Colo. App. 1995).</P>
    <P>
    <B>Where trial court's ruling is based on a question of law,
    the standard of review is de novo, rather than an abuse of
    discretion standard.</B>Trial court applied this section to
    undisputed facts and concluded that dismissal was mandatory
    under the plain language of the statute. People v. Carr, 205
    P.3d 471 (Colo. App. 2008).</P></ANNO-TEXT>

  thirty days. Such thirty-day period begins the first day on which
  the investigative or law enforcement officer begins to conduct an
  interception under the order or ten days after the order is
  entered, whichever occurs earlier. An extension of an order may

  that the authorization to intercept shall be executed as soon as
  practicable, shall be conducted in such a way as to minimize the
  interception under this section, and must terminate upon
  attainment of the authorized objective, or in any event in thirty
  days. No more than three extensions may be granted for any order
  entered under this section. In the event that the intercepted
  communication is in a code or foreign language and an expert in

  the interception.</M></P>
  <P N="(7)">(7)
  <M>If an order authorizing interception is entered pursuant to
  this section, the order may require reports to be made to the
  judge who issued the order, showing what progress has been made
  toward achievement of the authorized objective and the need for
  continued interception. Such report shall be made at such times
  as the judge may require.</M></P>

  way as will protect the recording from editing or other
  alterations. Immediately upon expiration of the period of the
  order, or extension thereof, the recording shall be made
  available to the judge issuing the order and sealed under his
  directions. Custody of the recording shall be wherever the judge
  orders. A recording shall not be destroyed except upon an order
  of the judge and in any event shall be kept for ten years.
  Duplicate recordings may be made for use or disclosure pursuant
  to the provisions of this section. The presence of the seal
  provided for by this subsection (8), or a satisfactory
  explanation for the absence thereof, is a prerequisite for the
  use or disclosure of the contents of any wire, oral, or
  electronic communication or evidence derived under this
  section.</M></P>
  <P N="(8)(b)">(b)
  <M>Applications made and orders granted under this section shall
  be sealed by the judge. Custody of the applications and orders
  shall be wherever the judge directs. The applications and orders
  shall be disclosed only upon a showing of good cause before a

  except on order of the judge to whom presented, and in any event
  shall be kept for ten years. Information obtained pursuant to a
  court order authorizing interception of wire, oral, or electronic
  communications shall not be used, published, or divulged except
  in accordance with the provisions of this article.</M></P>
  <P N="(8)(c)">(c)
  <M>Any violation of the provisions of this subsection (8) may be
  punished as contempt of court.</M></P>

  <M>Within a reasonable time, but not later than ninety days after
  the filing of an application for an order of approval under this
  section, which application is denied, or after the termination of
  the period of an order or extensions thereof, the judge to whom
  the application was presented shall cause to be served, on the

  authorized or approved. This ten-day period may be waived by the

  evidence derived therefrom on the grounds that: The communication
  was unlawfully intercepted; the order of authorization or
  approval under which it was intercepted is insufficient on its
  face; or the interception was not made in conformity with the
  order of authorization or approval. This motion shall be made
  before the trial, hearing, or proceeding unless there was no
  opportunity to make such motion or the person was not aware of
  the grounds of the motion. If the motion is granted, the contents
  of the intercepted wire, oral, or electronic communication or the

  making or authorizing the application certifies to the judge
  granting the motion or denying an application that the appeal is

    <B>Annotator's note.</B>Since § 16-15-102 is similar to
    repealed § 40-4-30, C.R.S. 1963, relevant cases construing that
    provision have been included in the annotations to this
    section.</P>
    <P>
    <B>Section held constitutional.</B>People v. Martin, 176 Colo.
    322, 490 P.2d 924 (1971).</P>
    <P>
    <B>Section is not an unconstitutional invasion of
    privacy.</B>People v. Milnes, 186 Colo. 409, 527 P.2d 1163
    (1974).</P>
    <P>
    <B>Because the benefits to society from crimes solved or
    frustrated by the use of wiretapping outweigh the limited
    invasion.</B>People v. Milnes, 186 Colo. 409, 527 P.2d 1163
    (1974).</P>
    <P>
    <B>Federal authorities given great weight in interpreting
    subsection (8)(a).</B>Because subsection (8)(a) is closely
    patterned after and designed to implement a federal wiretapping
    statute, federal authorities explaining the federal statute
    should be accorded great weight in interpreting subsection
    (8)(a). People v. Baez-Lopez, 2014 CO 26, 322 P.3d 924.</P>
    <P>
    <B>Problem of electronic surveillance.</B>The reason for the
    seriousness of the problem arises not from the fact that
    particular conversations are not specifically described and
    specifically authorized, but rather from the unmanageability
    generally of electronic surveillance, for the area is
    peculiarly sensitive due to its effort to probe the thoughts of
    man who is the object of the search. People v. Martin, 176
    Colo. 322, 490 P.2d 924 (1971).</P>
    <P>
    <B>This section allows law enforcement officers to intercept
    telephone communications</B>after having obtained judicial
    authorization upon a showing of probable cause. People v.

    <P>
    <B>Court order to be scrutinized under stringent
    standards.</B>A court order authorizing the wiretapping of
    telephonic communications must be scrutinized under the same
    stringent standards as other fourth amendment searches and
    seizures. People v. Montoya, 44 Colo. App. 234, 616 P.2d 156
    (1980).</P>
    <P>
    <B>Crime within scope of section.</B>Where the crimes for which
    the defendant is charged (possession, conspiracy to possess,
    possession for sale, conspiracy to possess narcotic drugs for
    sale) have a minimum penalty of from 2 to 10 years in the state
    penitentiary, he falls within the scope of this section. People

    <P>
    <B>Monitoring conversations between husband and wife in

    <P>
    <B>Consensually overheard conversation not
    "eavesdropping".</B>By the terms of § 18-9-304 (1)(a), a
    consensually overheard conversation is not eavesdropping.
    People v. Palmer, 652 P.2d 1092 (Colo. App. 1982).</P>
    <P>
    <B>Wiretap need not be used as last resort.</B>Subsection
    (2)(c) does not require that wiretapping be used only as a last
    resort. People v. Gable, 647 P.2d 246 (Colo. App. 1982).</P>
    <P>
    <B>Agents to minimize interception of nonrelevant
    conversations.</B>This section does not forbid the interception
    of all nonrelevant conversations, but rather instructs the
    agents to conduct surveillance in such a manner as to
    "minimize" the interception of such conversations. People v.
    Gable, 647 P.2d 246 (Colo. App. 1982).</P>
    <P>
    <B>Factors considered in determining whether such interceptions
    minimized.</B>Factors to consider in determining whether the
    agents have acted reasonably to minimize the interception of
    nonrelevant conversations include: The nature and scope of the
    alleged criminal enterprise; the government's reasonable
    expectations as to the contents of, and parties to, the
    conversations; the degree of judicial supervision of the
    wiretap; the length of the conversations; the phase of the
    investigation; whether the parties used coded language; and the
    percentage of calls intercepted which are incriminating. People

    <P>
    <B>Whether warrantless police eavesdropping violates the fourth
    amendment</B>depends on whether the defendant had a justified

    <P>
    <B>Wiretapping need not be used only as a last resort.</B>The
    requirements of subsection (4)(c) may be satisfied if the
    application informs the judge of the difficulties encountered
    and the lack of success or danger in using conventional
    investigatory methods. People v. Vazquez, 768 P.2d 721 (Colo.
    App. 1988), cert. denied, 787 P.2d 174 (Colo. 1990).</P>
    <P>
    <B>Application showing probable cause required.</B>An ex parte
    order for wiretapping or eavesdropping may be issued only upon
    application stating that there is probable cause to believe
    that evidence may be obtained. People v. Martin, 176 Colo. 322,
    490 P.2d 924 (1971).</P>
    <P>Affidavits in support of a request for an ex parte wiretap
    order must establish that there is probable cause to believe
    that evidence of specific enumerated crimes will be obtained
    through the substantial intrusion upon the individual's
    privacy. People v. Montoya, 44 Colo. App. 234, 616 P.2d 156
    (1980).</P>
    <P>An interception order may be issued only after a judge of
    competent jurisdiction has determined that specific grounds
    exist which justify the use of the intercepting devices. People
    v. Martin, 176 Colo. 322, 490 P.2d 924 (1971).</P>

    <B>Supporting affidavit for wiretap order serves same function
    as affidavit used to establish probable cause for search
    warrant.</B>People v. Wahl, 716 P.2d 123 (Colo. 1986).</P>
    <P>
    <B>Aguilar-Spinelli test applicable under section.</B>The
    standards of probable cause for issuance of a search warrant
    based on information given to an affiant police officer by an
    unidentified informant as set forth in the Aguilar-Spinelli
    test are applicable under this section. People v. Milnes, 186
    Colo. 409, 527 P.2d 1163 (1974).</P>
    <P>Under the Aguilar-Spinelli test, the affidavit must provide
    sufficient underlying circumstances to enable the magistrate to
    determine independently whether there is probable cause to
    believe that illegal activity is being carried on in the place
    to be searched and must set forth sufficient facts to allow the
    magistrate to determine independently that the informant is
    credible or his information reliable. People v. Montoya, 44
    Colo. App. 234, 616 P.2d 156 (1980).</P>
    <P>
    <B>Probable cause ceases to exist</B>when it is no longer
    reasonable to presume that the criminal activities are still
    being carried on in the place to be searched. People v.
    Montoya, 44 Colo. App. 234, 616 P.2d 156 (1980).</P>
    <P>
    <B>Element of time is crucial to determination of existence of
    probable cause;</B>if information provided the issuing
    magistrate does not reasonably demonstrate that the suspect is
    continuously engaged in criminal activity, a warrant based on
    dated, or "stale", evidence is invalid. People v. Montoya, 44
    Colo. App. 234, 616 P.2d 156 (1980).</P>
    <P>
    <B>Fact that magistrate was not in his regular office when he
    authorized search,</B>and made himself readily available to law
    enforcement officers, did not alter his character as a neutral
    and detached magistrate. People v. Montoya, 44 Colo. App. 234,
    616 P.2d 156 (1980).</P>
    <P>
    <B>Authorization sustained where affidavit established probable
    cause despite its errors.</B>Even though a substantial amount
    of information in the affidavit is either extraneous or
    innocuous, and thus could not serve alone as the basis for a
    determination of probable cause, and included in the affidavit
    is some information which is allegedly erroneous, if after
    striking this information probable cause still exists, the
    wiretap authorization must be sustained. People v. Montoya, 44
    Colo. App. 234, 616 P.2d 156 (1980).</P>
    <P>
    <B>The constitutional requirement that probable cause be
    reduced to writing is met</B>regardless of any provision within
    the wiretap statute allowing the judge to take additional
    testimony. People v. Martin, 176 Colo. 322, 490 P.2d 924
    (1971).</P>
    <P>
    <B>Identity of person allegedly committing offense must be
    included in application or affidavit.</B>People v. Martin, 176
    Colo. 322, 490 P.2d 924 (1971).</P>
    <P>
    <B>District attorney need not personally make application for
    supplemental use.</B>There is no doubt that the district
    attorney must personally initiate the wiretap, and that he must
    apply personally for any extension of the duration of the
    wiretap; however, the provision for supplemental use contains
    no such requirement. People v. Milnes, 186 Colo. 409, 527 P.2d
    1163 (1974).</P>
    <P>
    <B>Subsection (1)(a) requires the attorney general or an
    elected district attorney to personally authorize an
    application to initiate or extend a wiretap</B>but does not
    require the elected official to personally prepare or submit
    the application. People v. O'Hara, 240 P.3d 283 (Colo. App.
    2010), aff'd, 2012 CO 18, 271 P.3d 503.</P>
    <P>
    <B>Application to inform judge of difficulties of other

    be the height of unreasonableness to distinguish between
    information specifically authorized and that which is

    listen to conversations about one offense, upon learning of
    another offense, must at once close down the project and not
    use the information to prevent the other offense since the
    information is tainted. People v. Martin, 176 Colo. 322, 490

    <P>It would be unreasonable and unrealistic to suppress

    <ANNO-TEXT>
    <B>Prerequisites to application of subsection (10).</B>For the
    exclusionary application of subsection (10) to be operative, it
    must not only be at the behest of an aggrieved party, but,
    critically, it must be shown that the communication was
    unlawfully intercepted. Moreover, in order to make that
    determination, one must look to the prohibitory statutes on
    wiretapping and eavesdropping. People v. Morton, 189 Colo. 198,
    539 P.2d 1255 (1975), cert. denied, 423 U.S. 1053, 96 S. Ct.
    783, 46 L. Ed. 2d 642 (1976); People v. Richardson, 2014 COA
    50, 350 P.3d 905. 
    <P>Subsection (10) does not require the suppression of an
    aggrieved person's statements simply because they were derived
    from the illegally intercepted communications, but instead
    because the party who had illegally intercepted has been the
    one to "derive" other evidence therefrom. People in Interest of
    A.W., 982 P.2d 842 (Colo. 1999).</P>
    <P>
    <B>Consensual eavesdropping not an "unlawful
    interception".</B>Since §§ 18-9-303 and 18-9-304 do not
    prohibit or make unlawful consensual recorded eavesdropping,
    where one party to the conversation agrees to the recording,
    there is no "unlawful interception" within the meaning of
    subsection (10). Said subsection (10) is, therefore, not
    applicable, and the evidence should not be suppressed. People
    v. Morton, 189 Colo. 198, 539 P.2d 1255 (1975), cert. denied,
    423 U.S. 1053, 96 S. Ct. 783, 46 L. Ed. 2d 642 (1976).</P>
    <P>1991 amendment to subsection (1) did not change holding in
    People v. Morton that consensual eavesdropping is not an
    unlawful interception that must be suppressed under subsection
    (10). People v. Watson, 53 P.3d 707 (Colo. App. 2001).</P>
    <P>
    <B>Because defendant was an aggrieved person within the meaning
    of subsection (1), defendant had standing to move for
    suppression of a communication with a minor</B>on the basis
    that the communication was unlawfully intercepted because it
    lacked valid third-party consent. People v. Richardson, 2014
    COA 50, 350 P.3d 905.</P>
    <P>
    <B>Eavesdropping becomes an "unlawful interception" when
    consent is secured by fraudulent inducement.</B>People v.

    <P>
    <B>Unlawfully intercepted communications may not be received
    into evidence for any reason, including for impeachment
    purposes.</B>People in Interest of A.W., 982 P.2d 842 (Colo.

    <P>
    <B>Eavesdropping statutes require use of subjective and
    objective tests</B>to determine whether a person's conversation
    qualifies as protected oral communications. People v. Hart, 787
    P.2d 186 (Colo. App. 1989).</P>
    <P>
    <B>Tape recording of defendant's conversation with accomplice
    made without his knowledge in the back of police car could
    properly be considered</B>since, irrespective of defendant's
    subjective belief that his conversation while in the police
    vehicle was private, such belief was unreasonable and
    unjustified. People v. Palmer, 888 P.2d 348 (Colo. App.
    1994).</P>
    <P>
    <B>Wiretap of crimes excluded from section may be
    suppressed.</B>A finding that lesser crimes are not intended by
    congress to be included in the class of crimes for which a
    wiretap can be authorized does not render the entire state
    statute invalid, but is merely grounds for suppression with a
    recognition to restrict application of the statute to crimes
    such as those with which a defendant is charged. People v.
    Martin, 176 Colo. 322, 490 P.2d 924 (1971).</P>
    <P>
    <B>Right to suppress not impaired by grant of immunity.</B>A
    grand jury witness has a statutory right to seek the
    suppression of intercepted communications as well as evidence
    derived therefrom, and this right is not impaired by the
    court's grant of transactional immunity since, while such
    immunity adequately safeguards the witness's privilege against
    self-incrimination, it does not protect the witness's privacy
    interest in the contents of the intercepted communications. In
    re P.R. v. District Court, 637 P.2d 346 (Colo. 1981).</P>
    <P>
    <B>Discovery of documents supporting wiretap order cannot be
    withheld after contempt proceedings</B>are instituted against
    grand jury witnesses who refuse to testify, claiming questions
    are based upon information obtained by means of illegal
    wiretap. Prior to time grand jury witnesses are cited for
    contempt, adequate protection is afforded witnesses by the
    requirement that the court examine all facts before imposing
    contempt sanction. Westerberg v. District Court, 181 Colo. 10,
    506 P.2d 746 (1973), cert. denied, 414 U.S. 1162, 94 S. Ct.
    925, 39 L. Ed. 2d 115 (1974).</P>
    <P>
    <B>Suppression hearing prematurely granted.</B>Where no showing
    has been made that the court order which permitted electronic
    surveillance was invalid or was not properly followed, and what
    witnesses assert is a right to a hearing on a wiretap that
    might be illegal, and to suppress intercepted contents that
    might be used in the future in some manner, an order granting
    the witnesses a suppression hearing is premature and subject to
    prohibition. People ex rel. Dunbar v. District Court, 179 Colo.

    <P>
    <B>Although the district attorney did not timely provide
    defense counsel with copies of the application, affidavits, and

    defendant was able to timely file a motion to

    enforcement administration (DEA) self-sealing plastic evidence
    bag in the DEA evidence vault. This section does not require a

  <M>Legislative declaration.</M></CATCH-LINE>The general assembly
  finds that a significant number of criminal offenders remain at
  large in this state because law enforcement agencies often lack
  information concerning criminal activity. In many instances
  private citizens have information that, if known to law
  enforcement agencies, would lead to the detection and
  apprehension of such offenders. Private, nonprofit crime stopper
  organizations that offer rewards for such information have been
  successful at encouraging some citizens to come forward; however,
  even with the offer of a reward, many citizens do not come
  forward because they fear involvement and shun publicity. In
  order to remedy this situation and to increase the effectiveness
  of crime stopper organizations, the general assembly finds and
  declares that it is appropriate to provide for the anonymity of
  any person who provides information concerning criminal activity
  to a crime stopper organization and to provide for the
  confidentiality of crime stopper organization
  records.</SECTION-TEXT>

  <M>Application - character certificate.</M></CATCH-LINE>(1)
  <M>After a conviction, all applications for commutation of
  sentence or pardon for crimes committed must be accompanied by a
  certificate of the respective superintendent of the correctional
  facility, showing the conduct of an applicant during the
  applicant's confinement in the correctional facility, together
  with such evidences of former good character as the applicant is
  able to produce. Before the governor approves such application,
  it must be first submitted to the present district attorney of
  the district in which the applicant was convicted and to the
  judge who sentenced and the attorney who prosecuted at the trial
  of the applicant, if available, for such comment as they may deem
  proper concerning the merits of the application, so as to provide
  the governor with information upon which to base the governor's
  action. The governor shall make reasonable efforts to locate the
  judge who sentenced and the attorney who prosecuted at the trial
  of the applicant and shall afford them a reasonable time, not
  less than fourteen days, to comment on such applications. The
  requirements of this section are deemed to have been met if the
  persons to whom the application is submitted for comment do not
  comment within fourteen days after their receipt of the
  application or within such other reasonable time in excess of
  fourteen days as specified by the governor, or if the sentencing
  judge or prosecuting attorney cannot be located, are
  incapacitated, or are otherwise unavailable for comment despite
  the good-faith efforts of the governor to obtain their comments.
  Good character previous to conviction, good conduct during
  confinement in the correctional facility, the statements of the
  sentencing judge and the district attorneys, if any, and any
  other material concerning the merits of the application must be
  given such weight as seems just and proper to the governor, in
  view of the circumstances of each particular case, with due
  regard for the reformation of the accused. The governor has sole
  discretion in evaluating said comments and in soliciting other
  comments the governor deems appropriate.</M>
  <P N="(2)">(2)
  <M>The governor may grant pardons to a class of defendants who
  were convicted of the possession of up to two ounces of
  marijuana. The requirements of subsection (1) of this section do
  not apply to defendants who were convicted of the possession of
  up to two ounces of marijuana, but the governor may make any
  inquiry as deemed appropriate to seek any relevant information
  necessary from any person or agency to reach an informed
  decision.</M></P></SECTION-TEXT>

    <B>Constitutionality.</B>Statutes imposing liability for costs
    on a convicted defendant have been uniformly held to be
    constitutional. People v. Fisher, 189 Colo. 297, 539 P.2d 1258
    (1975). 
    <P>
    <B>Costs are a creature of statute unknown to the common
    law.</B>At common law there were no costs. Bd. of County
    Comm'rs v. Wilson, 3 Colo. App. 492, 34 P. 265 (1893); Saunders
    v. People, 63 Colo. 241, 165 P. 781 (1917).</P>
    <P>
    <B>Section protects defendant.</B>The provisions of this
    section are wise and beneficent. They extend ample protection
    to an indigent defendant. They afford him every facility for
    making a legitimate defense. Bd. of County Comm'rs v. Wilson, 3
    Colo. App. 492, 34 P. 265 (1893).</P>
    <P>
    <B>It refers to costs incurred by the prosecution and not those
    of the defendant.</B>It is only in case of the conviction of
    the defendant and his inability to pay the costs, or of his
    acquittal, that costs are made a charge against the state; so
    that there is no difficulty in supposing that the costs
    referred to are the costs incurred by the prosecution, and not
    those incurred by the defendant. Bd. of County Comm'rs v.
    Wilson, 3 Colo. App. 492, 34 P. 265 (1893); Saunders v. People,
    63 Colo. 241, 165 P. 781 (1917).</P>
    <P>
    <B>Costs in criminal cases must be taxed according to law and
    not as per agreement</B>between court and convict, or between
    the prosecuting officer and the convict. Murphy v. People, 3
    Colo. 147 (1876).</P>
    <P>The costs in a criminal case must be taxed according to
    statutes and not according to any plea agreement. People v.
    Fisher, 189 Colo. 297, 539 P.2d 1258 (1975).</P>
    <P>
    <B>There is no limit to the amount of costs which may be
    incurred by the prosecution in a criminal case.</B>This is left
    to the discretion of the prosecutor and the court. Parker v.
    People, 7 Colo. App. 56, 42 P. 172 (1895).</P>
    <P>
    <B>The general rule as to payment of costs may be avoided if
    the trial judge, in his discretion,</B>determines that the
    defendant is unable to pay the costs. People v. Fisher, 189
    Colo. 297, 539 P.2d 1258 (1975).</P>
    <P>
    <B>Differs from determination of indigency.</B>Whether a
    presumably innocent defendant is declared indigent for the
    purposes of appointing counsel before he is brought to trial
    involves different considerations than the question of whether
    a convicted defendant may be charged with the costs expended by
    the state to secure his conviction. People v. Fisher, 189 Colo.
    297, 539 P.2d 1258 (1975).</P>
    <P>The sixth amendment of the constitution compels appointing
    counsel for indigent defendants but does not speak to whether
    convicted defendants of limited resources may be charged with
    the costs of their trial. People v. Fisher, 189 Colo. 297, 539
    P.2d 1258 (1975).</P>
    <P>
    <B>The expenses of obtaining the testimony of witnesses for an
    indigent defendant must be paid by the state.</B>People v.
    McCabe, 37 Colo. App. 181, 546 P.2d 1289 (1975).</P>
    <P>
    <B>Arrest part of preliminary hearing.</B>The arrest of one
    charged with crime under a capias issued by a justice, is part
    of the preliminary hearing before the magistrate. Bd. of County
    Comm'rs v. Camp, 48 Colo. 61, 108 P. 972 (1910).</P>

  <M>In any case in which a defendant has an unsatisfied
  restitution obligation ordered pursuant to section 18-1.3-603 or
  19-2.5-1104, the judicial department is authorized to transmit
  data concerning the obligation to the department of revenue for
  the purpose of conducting a data match and offsetting the
  restitution obligation against a state income tax refund pursuant
  to section 39-21-108 (3). For any restitution obligation
  identified by the judicial department for offset, the state court
  administrator shall:</M>
  <P N="(1)(a)">(a)
  <M>On at least an annual basis, certify to the department of
  revenue the social security number of the defendant who is
  obligated to pay the restitution obligation and the amount of the
  outstanding restitution obligation. The department of revenue may
  request additional identifying information from the judicial
  department that is necessary to obtain an accurate data
  match.</M></P>
  <P N="(1)(b)">(b)
  <M>Upon notification by the department of revenue of a data
  match, notify the appropriate court that a match has occurred and
  that an offset is pending and provide to the court the
  identifying information received from the department concerning
  the defendant whose state income tax refund is subject to the
  offset;</M></P>
  <P N="(1)(c)">(c)
  <M>Provide or require the appropriate court to provide written
  notice to the defendant that the state intends to offset the
  defendant's restitution obligation against his or her state
  income tax refund and that the defendant has the right to object
  to the offset and request an administrative review; and</M></P>
  <P N="(1)(d)">(d)
  <M>Upon receipt of funds for offset from the department of
  revenue, transmit the funds to the appropriate court.</M></P>
  <P N="(2)">(2)
  <M>The clerk of court shall apply funds received pursuant to this
  section to the defendant's outstanding restitution obligation. If
  the moneys received exceed the defendant's current restitution
  obligation, the excess may be applied to other financial
  obligations the defendant owes the court or the judicial
  department. If no other financial obligations are owed, the clerk
  of court shall refund any excess to the defendant.</M></P>
  <P N="(3)">(3)
  <M>The state court administrator may adopt rules establishing the
  process by which a defendant may object to an offset and request
  an administrative review. The sole issues to be determined at the
  administrative review shall be whether the person is required to
  pay the restitution and the amount of the outstanding
  restitution.</M></P>
  <P N="(4)">(4)

  <M>Collection of restitution by the victim.</M></CATCH-LINE>(1)
  <M>Any victim in whose name a restitution order has been entered
  shall have a right to pursue collection of the amount of
  restitution owed to such person in such person's own name. Any
  victim who wishes to collect restitution pursuant to the
  provisions of this section shall first deliver to the clerk of
  the court or, if the defendant was sentenced to the department of
  corrections, to the executive director of the department of
  corrections a notice of intent to pursue collection. Upon receipt
  of notice of intent to pursue collection, the court, the
  collections investigator, and the department of corrections shall
  cease all attempts to collect the restitution due to the person
  or persons named in the notice, except that the collections
  investigator may still assist the victim in the victim's effort.
  The filing of a victim's intent to pursue collection and a
  victim's subsequent collection efforts do not alter a court's
  order that restitution is a condition of the defendant's
  probation, and such probation may still be revoked by the court
  upon a finding of failure to pay restitution.</M>
  <P N="(2)">(2)
  <M>Any victim who has filed a notice of intent to pursue
  collection may apply to the sentencing court for issuance of any
  of the following that, if provided, shall be provided without
  cost:</M></P>
  <P N="(2)(a)">(a)
  <M>One or more certified copies of the transcript of the order
  for restitution;</M></P>
  <P N="(2)(b)">(b)
  <M>An order that a portion of the defendant's earnings be
  withheld pursuant to section 16-18.5-105 (3)(b);</M></P>
  <P N="(2)(c)">(c)
  <M>A writ of execution, writ of attachment, or other civil
  process to collect upon a judgment pursuant to article 52 of
  title 13, C.R.S.</M></P>
  <P N="(3)">(3)
  <M>If the victim chooses to record a copy of the transcript with
  a clerk and recorder or with the secretary of state, the victim
  may do so without charge.</M></P>
  <P N="(4)">(4)
  <M>A victim may withdraw his or her intent to pursue collection
  by filing a notice of such withdrawal with the person to whom the
  notice of intent was served pursuant to subsection (1) of this
  section. Such notice shall state the amount, if any, of
  restitution collected by the victim. Upon receipt of a notice of
  withdrawal, the collections investigator or the department of
  corrections shall pursue collection of the restitution pursuant
  to this article.</M></P>
  <P N="(5)">(5)
  <M>The judicial department shall develop informational brochures
  for victims explaining the process of restitution and the

    defines "governor" to include persons authorized to perform the
    functions of governor, the governor may delegate his authority
    to review and sign extradition documents. Macurdy v. Leach, 662

    <P>
    <B>Delegation of governor's executive authority not

    authority to employees in his office and assistant attorneys
    general. Whittington v. Bray, 200 Colo. 17, 612 P.2d 72

    <P>
    <B>And exercise of powers delegated by governor is "executive

    officer of Colorado, and, when he properly delegates power, the
    exercise of that power is action of the "executive authority".

    Law and Procedure", see 35 Dicta 26 (1958). 
    <P>
    <B>Purpose of extradition.</B>The United States constitutional
    provision regarding extradition from one state to another was
    adopted to promote justice, to aid the states in enforcing
    their laws, and not to shield malefactors. Tinsley v. Woods,
    135 Colo. 590, 313 P.2d 1006 (1957); Travis v. People, 135
    Colo. 141, 308 P.2d 997 (1957).</P>
    <P>The public purpose to be effected by extradition is to
    prevent the successful escape of all persons accused of crime,
    whether convicted or unconvicted, and to secure their return to
    the state from which they fled for the purpose of punishment.
    It is invoked to aid the administration of criminal justice and
    to more certainly insure the punishment of the guilty. Travis
    v. People, 135 Colo. 141, 308 P.2d 997 (1957); Gottfried v.
    Cronin, 192 Colo. 25, 555 P.2d 969 (1976).</P>
    <P>The several states adopted the provisions of this uniform
    act so that one who commits a crime in one state cannot go to a
    sister state to avoid prosecution, or cannot send agents or
    accomplices from one state into another with impunity while he
    remains out of the state where the crime is perpetrated. Boyd
    v. Van Cleave, 180 Colo. 403, 505 P.2d 1305 (1973).</P>
    <P>
    <B>Extradition serves the interest of comity between
    states.</B>Bryan v. Conn, 187 Colo. 275, 530 P.2d 1274
    (1975).</P>
    <P>
    <B>And, therefore, extradition proceeding should not be
    utilized as a vehicle to challenge acts undertaken by a sister
    state</B>to enforce their criminal laws. Bryan v. Conn, 187
    Colo. 275, 530 P.2d 1274 (1975).</P>
    <P>
    <B>Transfer of custody not a waiver of jurisdiction.</B>This
    article contemplates that the mere transfer of custody to
    another jurisdiction will not be deemed a presumptive or
    implied waiver of jurisdiction by the demanding state.
    Schoengarth v. Bray, 200 Colo. 288, 615 P.2d 655 (1980).</P>
    <P>
    <B>Waiver of state's right to extradite.</B>A finding of a
    waiver of a state's right to extradite requires affirmative
    evidence of a state's intent to waive jurisdiction over the
    fugitive and will not be presumed from a silent record.
    Schoengarth v. Bray, 200 Colo. 288, 615 P.2d 655 (1980).</P>
    <P>
    <B>Construction of section.</B>Statutes providing for the
    arrest and extradition of fugitives are in derogation of
    constitutional guarantees of immunity from arrest and must be
    strictly construed. Matthews v. People, 136 Colo. 102, 314 P.2d
    906 (1957).</P>
    <P>The extradition statutes should not be so narrowly construed
    as to enable offenders against the laws of a state to find
    permanent asylum in another state. Gottfried v. Cronin, 192
    Colo. 25, 555 P.2d 969 (1976).</P>
    <P>
    <B>The clause "any person charged with a crime"</B>includes a
    person whose judgment of conviction remains unsatisfied.
    Gottfried v. Cronin, 192 Colo. 25, 555 P.2d 969 (1976).</P>
    <P>
    <B>No probable cause necessary where person convicted and
    sentenced.</B>No showing of probable cause is necessary for the
    extradition of a person who has been convicted and sentenced.
    Morgan v. Miller, 197 Colo. 341, 593 P.2d 357 (1979).</P>
    <P>
    <B>The phrase "fled from justice"</B>has generally been
    interpreted to cover individuals who are merely absent from the
    state when they are sought to answer for a crime, irrespective
    of their manner of leaving the state. Gottfried v. Cronin, 192
    Colo. 25, 555 P.2d 969 (1976).</P>
    <P>
    <B>Reason for leaving jurisdiction of demanding state
    immaterial.</B>For extradition purposes, it is immaterial why
    the person demanded left the jurisdiction of the demanding
    state: he is a fugitive within the meaning of this section if
    he was present in the demanding state at the time of the
    commission of the offense charged and thereafter departed for
    whatever reason. Danielson v. Miller, 196 Colo. 537, 587 P.2d
    788 (1978).</P>
    <P>
    <B>Where demanding state voluntarily released fugitive to
    another state.</B>Under this section, a person can be
    classified as a fugitive from justice where the demanding state
    voluntarily released him to another state to serve out his
    unexpired sentence there. Gottfried v. Cronin, 192 Colo. 25,
    555 P.2d 969 (1976).</P>
    <P>
    <B>The United States constitution guarantees no right of
    asylum</B>to a person who has committed a crime in one state or
    territory of the United States and fled to another
    jurisdiction. Cutting v. Geer, 135 Colo. 503, 313 P.2d 314
    (1957).</P>
    <P>
    <B>Extradition to or from territories has been upheld</B>under
    the federal statute, even though the United States constitution
    is silent as to extradition to or from territories. Cutting v.
    Geer, 135 Colo. 503, 313 P.2d 314 (1957).</P>
    <P>
    <B>The governor of Colorado has no inherent powers of arrest
    and surrender</B>and cannot proceed as a volunteer but is
    limited to acting pursuant to a demand or a request from the
    executive of a sister state, and then only in strict conformity
    with law. Matthews v. People, 136 Colo. 102, 314 P.2d 906
    (1957); Conrad v. McClearn, 166 Colo. 568, 445 P.2d 222
    (1968).</P>
    <P>
    <B>This section makes it the duty of the governor to cause the
    arrest and surrender</B>of any person who is charged with a
    felony in the demanding state and who has fled therefrom and
    taken asylum in Colorado. Olson v. People, 138 Colo. 310, 332
    P.2d 486 (1958).</P>
    <P>It is the duty of the governor to issue his warrant for the
    arrest and delivery to the executive of another state any
    person charged with a crime in that state who has fled from
    justice and is found in this state. Krutka v. Bryer, 150 Colo.
    293, 372 P.2d 83 (1962).</P>
    <P>
    <B>Demanding state has right to extradition of
    fugitive.</B>When demanding the return of a fugitive, the
    demanding state does not seek a favor, but appears as a
    sovereign state demanding rights granted to it by the
    constitution and laws of the United States. Matthews v. People,
    136 Colo. 102, 314 P.2d 906 (1957); Olson v. People, 138 Colo.
    310, 332 P.2d 486 (1958).</P>
    <P>Constitutional rights to limitations on the use of evidence
    on the issue of guilt or innocence are not at issue in the
    rendition proceeding. What is in issue is the constitutional
    right of the demanding state to have a defendant promptly
    returned to that state on a showing of probable cause. North v.
    Koch, 169 Colo. 508, 457 P.2d 915 (1969).</P>
    <P>Demanding state is entitled to obtain custody of the
    petitioner through extradition proceedings after extradition
    statute was complied with and proof established that the
    appellant is a fugitive from justice. Eathorne v. Nelson, 180
    Colo. 288, 505 P.2d 1 (1973).</P>
    <P>
    <B>A sister state may proceed in extradition in either of two
    ways:</B>(1) Make a demand upon any state for return of a
    fugitive under the constitution and laws of the United States
    and this section; or (2) make demand upon the governor of
    Colorado for surrender under § 16-19-107 for any person in this
    state charged in another state with committing an act in this
    state, or in a third state, intentionally resulting in a crime
    in the state whose executive authority is making the demand.
    Matthews v. People, 136 Colo. 102, 314 P.2d 906 (1957); Olson
    v. People, 138 Colo. 310, 332 P.2d 486 (1958); Layher v. Van
    Cleave, 171 Colo. 465, 468 P.2d 32 (1970).</P>
    <P>
    <B>Habeas corpus proceeding is not filed as part of an
    extradition proceeding</B>but is filed as an independent civil
    action. People v. Gomez, 192 Colo. 313, 558 P.2d 439
    (1976).</P>
    <P>
    <B>Form complied with § 16-19-104.</B>Demand for extradition
    complied with § 16-19-104 although the requisition documents
    contained both a demand for extradition, pursuant to this
    section, and a request for extradition predicated on §
    16-19-106, which controls executive agreements, since the
    executive agreement, which accompanied the requisition
    documents, served only to ensure that the demanding state would
    return and surrender defendant to the Colorado authorities upon
    the completion of the trial in the demanding state. Buffalo v.
    Tanksley, 189 Colo. 45, 536 P.2d 827 (1975).</P>
    <P>
    <B>Prima facie showing of identity</B>is made when the name of
    the person is identical to that appearing in the requisition
    documents. Light v. Cronin, 621 P.2d 309 (Colo. 1980).</P>
    <P>Where there is a discrepancy in the name in the extradition
    documents and the name claimed by the prisoner, a prima facie
    showing of identity is made where testimony, photographs, and
    fingerprints identify the fugitive being sought. Secrest v.
    Simonet, 708 P.2d 803 (Colo. 1985).</P>
    <P>
    <B>Governor's grant of extradition prima facie evidence</B>that
    constitutional and statutory requirements have been met. Howe
    v. Cronin, 197 Colo. 17, 589 P.2d 930 (1979).</P>
    <P>
    <B>Presumption of defendant's presence in demanding state at
    time of crime.</B>The issuance of a governor's warrant by the
    governor of the asylum state creates a presumption that the
    person sought to be extradited was in the demanding state at
    the time the crime was committed. The person whose extradition
    is sought must show by clear and convincing evidence that he
    was not in the demanding state at the time the crime was
    committed. Light v. Cronin, 621 P.2d 309 (Colo. 1980); Briddle
    v. Caldwell, 628 P.2d 613 (Colo. 1981).</P>
    <P>
    <B>Where any statutory ground exists to substantiate
    extradition documents</B>on their face, the courts of the

    <B>Purpose of extradition law.</B>The extradition law is
    designed to prevent the successful escape of all persons
    accused of crime, whether convicted or not, and to secure their

    punishment. Gottfried v. Cronin, 192 Colo. 25, 555 P.2d 969

    496 P.2d 306 (1972).</P>
    <P>
    <B>All documents read together.</B>In determining whether
    extradition documents sufficiently charge an accused with a
    crime in the demanding state, or that he was convicted of a
    crime and sentenced therefor, from which he escaped, or that
    the accused has broken the terms of his bail, probation, or
    parole, all of the requisition documents must be read and
    considered together. Martello v. Baker, 189 Colo. 195, 539 P.2d

    <P>In evaluating the sufficiency of requisition papers, all of
    the documents must be read and considered together. Patrick v.

    <P>
    <B>Extradition requisition may refer to, annex, and
    authenticate accompanying papers</B>and, if together they meet
    statutory requirements, that is sufficient compliance with the
    requirements of this section. Hall v. Cronin, 196 Colo. 333,
    585 P.2d 286 (1978).</P>
    <P>
    <B>Statutory grounds required in demand for execution stated in
    alternative.</B>It is fundamental that the statutory grounds in
    this section, which are required to be set forth in the form of
    demand for execution, are stated in the alternative. If any one
    ground is adequately set forth as required by this section,
    then the demand is sufficient in form to authorize the
    execution of the personal demand. Norrod v. Bower, 187 Colo.
    421, 532 P.2d 330 (1975).</P>
    <P>Demand for extradition complied with this section although
    the requisition documents contained both a demand for
    extradition, pursuant to § 16-19-103, and a request for
    extradition predicated on § 16-19-106, which controls executive
    agreements, since the executive agreement, which accompanied
    the requisition documents, served only to ensure that the
    demanding state would return and surrender defendant to the
    Colorado authorities upon the completion of the trial in the
    demanding state. Buffalo v. Tanksley, 189 Colo. 45, 536 P.2d
    827 (1975).</P>
    <P>The statutory requirement for supporting documents in a
    foreign state's form of demand is stated in the alternative.
    Johnson v. Kiefer, 624 P.2d 894 (Colo. 1981).</P>
    <P>
    <B>Any one basis for extradition sufficient to meet statutory
    test.</B>If any one basis for extradition is adequately set
    forth as required by this statute, the form of the demand meets
    the statutory test. Johnson v. Kiefer, 624 P.2d 894 (Colo.
    1981); Butcher v. Caldwell, 677 P.2d 342 (Colo. 1984).</P>
    <P>
    <B>Allegation of presence in demanding state in governor's
    warrant creates presumption.</B>The requirement that the person
    sought to be extradited be shown to be in the state when the
    crime was committed is satisfied by an allegation to that
    effect in a governor's warrant, which creates a presumption
    that the accused was in the demanding state at the time the
    offense was committed. Graham v. Vanderhoof, 185 Colo. 334, 524
    P.2d 611 (1974); Johnson v. Cronin, 690 P.2d 1277 (Colo.

    <P>
    <B>Court's habeas corpus review limited.</B>Once the governor
    has granted extradition, a court considering habeas corpus
    relief is limited to deciding whether: (1) The extradition
    documents on their face are in order; (2) the petitioner has
    been charged with a crime in the demanding state; (3) the
    petitioner is the person named in the request for extradition;
    and (4) the petitioner is a fugitive. Gerard v. Ossola, 649
    P.2d 1110 (Colo. 1982); Rodriquez v. Sandoval, 680 P.2d 1278
    (Colo. 1984).</P>
    <P>
    <B>Lawful demand required prior to extradition.</B>The governor
    of Colorado must have a lawful demand or request before
    surrendering one who has committed a crime in another state.
    Massey v. Wilson, 199 Colo. 121, 605 P.2d 469 (1980).</P>
    <P>
    <B>Requisition for extradition presents questions of law and
    fact.</B>Upon receipt of a requisition for interstate
    rendition, the governor of the asylum state has two questions
    to pass upon: (1) Is the person demanded substantially charged
    with a crime against the laws of the demanding state by
    indictment or affidavit before a magistrate?; and (2) is the
    person a fugitive from the justice of the demanding state? The
    first of these questions is one of law, while the second is one
    of fact. Buhler v. People, 151 Colo. 345, 377 P.2d 748 (1963);
    Capra v. Ballarby, 158 Colo. 91, 405 P.2d 205 (1965).</P>
    <P>The question as to whether a defendant is a fugitive from
    justice is one of fact. Harding v. People, 161 Colo. 571, 423
    P.2d 847 (1967).</P>
    <P>
    <B>It must allege presence in demanding state.</B>The
    requirement of alleging presence in the demanding state is
    clearly imposed upon the requisition of the governor of the

    <P>The requirement that the indictment, information, or

    <P>
    <B>Charging document must be framed substantially in statutory

    <P>
    <B>Extradition ordered if minimal requirements met.</B>If in

    <B>Adequate statement as to parole violation.</B>Demand

    <B>The words "jumped bail"</B>in a demand for extradition are

    Colo. 36, 550 P.2d 349 (1976).</P>
    <P>
    <B>Indictment need not allege elements of crime.</B>Upon the
    trial of the issue of guilt, it would doubtless be necessary
    for the prosecution to prove an essential element of the crime.
    It is not necessary that the indictment should contain any such
    allegation. The indictment did "substantially charge" the
    petitioner with the crime of sodomy; being a crime known to the
    common law, further statutory definition of the word sodomy was
    unnecessary. Beliajus v. Phillips, 170 Colo. 212, 460 P.2d 233
    (1969).</P>
    <P>
    <B>Or prove criminal intent.</B>The question of criminal intent
    is relevant only to the sufficiency of the demand for
    extradition. It is not an element to be proved in the
    responding state. Instead, it is a jurisdictional fact which
    must appear from the face of the supporting documents. Where
    the basis for extradition is that defendant has been charged in
    California in the manner provided in this section with
    committing an act in this state, or in a third state,
    intentionally resulting in a crime in California, the trial
    court was under no duty to admit the evidence offered to prove
    that defendant was financially unable to make the support
    payments to negate the intent to commit a crime. Conrad v.
    McClearn, 166 Colo. 568, 445 P.2d 222 (1968).</P>
    <P>
    <B>The asylum state has no authority to pass on the technical
    sufficiency of an indictment</B>in an interstate rendition
    proceeding. If the subject of extradition desires to attack the
    technical insufficiency of an indictment, he must do so in the
    demanding state. Capra v. Ballarby, 158 Colo. 91, 405 P.2d 205
    (1965); Boyd v. Van Cleave, 180 Colo. 403, 505 P.2d 1305

    Colo. 517, 452 P.2d 756 (1969).</P>
    <P>A court of an asylum state is without power to review the
    determination of probable cause by the demanding state. Gerard
    v. Ossola, 649 P.2d 1110 (Colo. 1982).</P>
    <P>The sufficiency of the evidence to support the charge is an
    issue to be resolved by the demanding state. Crosby v.
    Griswould, 650 P.2d 568 (Colo. 1982).</P>
    <P>Matters of technical pleading will not be considered in an
    extradition hearing. Eathorne v. Nelson, 180 Colo. 288, 505
    P.2d 1 (1973).</P>
    <P>It is fundamental that the technical sufficiency of the
    indictment is for the court of the demanding state to determine

    <P>
    <B>Likewise, asylum state not concerned with criminal
    procedure.</B>Whether demanding state required preliminary
    examination before felony charge could be filed is a concern of
    the demanding state, not the asylum state. Boyd v. Van Cleave,
    180 Colo. 403, 505 P.2d 1305 (1973).</P>
    <P>
    <B>Nor on constitutional claims.</B>However meritorious a
    defendant's constitutional claims may be, when the issue
    centers on extradition in a habeas corpus proceeding, the
    question must be resolved by the courts of the demanding state
    and not by the courts of Colorado. Buffalo v. Tanksley, 189
    Colo. 45, 536 P.2d 827 (1975).</P>
    <P>
    <B>Nor as to parole violation.</B>Whether a person convicted of

    313 P.2d 1006 (1957).</P>
    <P>The relinquishing state will not look beyond the statement
    of the governor of the demanding state that the person sought
    has violated the terms of his parole. An inquiry into that
    subject is reserved for the demanding state upon the
    individual's return. Wynsma v. Leach, 189 Colo. 59, 536 P.2d
    817 (1975).</P>
    <P>
    <B>Or whether terms of probation violated.</B>Whether the

    state. Bernardo v. Cronin, 191 Colo. 36, 550 P.2d 349
    (1976).</P>

    275, 530 P.2d 1274 (1975).</P>
    <P>Due process of law does not require the courts of this state

    <P>In light of § 16-19-103 and the act's purposes, this section
    does not limit the extradition of an individual convicted of a
    crime to instances where he has "escaped from confinement or
    has broken the terms of his bail, probation, or parole". Such
    language was only meant to be illustrative, but not exhaustive,
    of the occasions when a convicted person can be considered to
    have fled from the justice of another state. Gottfried v.

    <P>
    <B>A person remains charged with crime while the judgment of

    v. Woods, 135 Colo. 590, 313 P.2d 1006 (1957).</P>
    <P>A typewritten demand such as the judgment of conviction
    satisfies the language of the law. It alone is sufficient;
    hence, whose signature was on the order of commitment showing

    <P>When extradition is for an offense that has resulted in

    <B>Parolee subject to extradition.</B>A crime that has resulted

    U.S. Const., which mandates the relinquishment of any person
    "charged" with a crime who has fled from justice and is in
    another state, so long as the sentence resulting from
    conviction is unsatisfied. Consequently, a parolee is subject
    to extradition as a fugitive because, as a convict with an
    unexpired sentence, he remains criminally "charged". His
    extradition is for his original offense. Wynsma v. Leach, 189

    <B>Or for parole violation.</B>A convicted individual may be
    extradited as a fugitive when he, prior to the revocation of
    parole, seeks asylum in the state from which he is sought to be
    extradited. The paroled prisoner is declared to be a fugitive
    from justice on the ground that he is a convict whose time has

    the grand jury so extradition papers based upon an indictment
    need not have an additional showing of probable cause. Eathorne
    v. Nelson, 180 Colo. 288, 505 P.2d 1 (1973).</P>
    <P>When extradition is founded upon a criminal indictment,
    supporting affidavits are unnecessary and may be regarded as
    immaterial surplusage when considering the sufficiency of the
    form of demand required. McCoy v. Cronin, 187 Colo. 364, 531
    P.2d 379 (1975).</P>
    <P>
    <B>But affidavit alone must show probable cause for
    arrest.</B>An affidavit used to charge a crime for the purpose
    of obtaining an arrest warrant must set forth facts sufficient
    to justify a finding of the existence of probable cause. It
    should report or summarize enough evidence to justify the
    issuance of an arrest warrant in the accusing state. People v.
    McFall, 175 Colo. 151, 486 P.2d 6 (1971).</P>
    <P>The affidavit in support of the extradition documents must
    also contain sufficient information to justify a fourth
    amendment finding of probable cause that the accused committed
    the crime with which he is charged. Allen v. Cronin, 189 Colo.
    540, 543 P.2d 707 (1975); Renton v. Cronin, 196 Colo. 109, 582
    P.2d 677 (1978).</P>
    <P>The affidavit which accompanies the arrest warrant and the
    criminal complaint from the demanding state must set forth some
    of the underlying circumstances surrounding the crime charged,
    as well as an adequate identification of the source, or
    sources, of the information set forth in the affidavit. Allen
    v. Cronin, 189 Colo. 540, 543 P.2d 707 (1975).</P>
    <P>
    <B>Probable cause established that defendant committed crime of
    escape.</B>Where the complaint and affidavit was based upon the
    personal information and knowledge of the chief records officer
    of the Kentucky state reformatory, stating under oath that
    appellant had been confined in the Kentucky state reformatory
    under a sentence of 10 years for armed robbery, pursuant to a
    judgment of conviction from the Jefferson circuit court of
    Louisville, Kentucky; that affiant had been the chief records
    officer of the reformatory for 16 years and was in charge of
    the official custody and control records of the appellant at
    the reformatory; and that he knew, from these records and his
    own personal knowledge, that appellant did escape from the
    reformatory, leaving while on a hospital trip to Louisville,
    Kentucky, the complaint and affidavit is sufficient to
    establish probable cause that appellant had committed the
    substantive crime of escape under the Kentucky statute. Norrod
    v. Bower, 187 Colo. 421, 532 P.2d 330 (1975).</P>
    <P>
    <B>Whether the affidavits establishing probable cause were
    executed before or after the charging document is
    immaterial,</B>provided that the extradition documents, viewed
    in their entirety, establish probable cause that the person to
    be extradited committed the offense. Wood v. Leach, 189 Colo.
    361, 540 P.2d 1084 (1975); See Hill v. Miller, 195 Colo. 370,
    578 P.2d 655 (1978); Moore v. Miller, 198 Colo. 24, 596 P.2d 64

    <P>
    <B>Prima facie showing of identity.</B>Where the name of the
    person in custody is identical to that appearing in the
    extradition documents, there is a prima facie showing of
    identity and the burden is on the petitioner to disprove the
    presumed identity. Samples v. Cronin, 189 Colo. 40, 536 P.2d
    306 (1975); Guy v. Nelson, 630 P.2d 610 (Colo. 1981).</P>
    <P>Identity of name with the extradition documents is
    sufficient to establish a prima facie showing of identity; and,
    unless overcome by the appellant's evidence showing lack of
    identity, the prima facie showing is sufficient to establish
    identity. Cates v. Cronin, 194 Colo. 89, 570 P.2d 524
    (1977).</P>
    <P>Once the prosecution has established a prima facie showing
    of identity, the person charged as a fugitive must show that he
    is not the person sought by the demanding state. Beam v.
    McKinster, 652 P.2d 618 (Colo. 1982).</P>
    <P>Once a prima facie case for extradition has been
    established, the burden devolves upon the accused to prove by
    clear and convincing evidence either that he is not a fugitive
    from the demanding state or that he is not substantially
    charged with a crime in that state. Lucero v. Martin, 660 P.2d
    902 (Colo. 1983); Richardson v. Sullivan, 700 P.2d 534 (Colo.
    1985); Council v. MacFarlane, 709 P.2d 947 (Colo. 1985).</P>
    <P>However, the use of a "a/k/a" as a means of identifying a
    fugitive in a complaint, standing alone, is not sufficient to
    establish a prima facie showing of identity. Cates v. Sullivan,
    696 P.2d 322 (Colo. 1985).</P>
    <P>But the use of "a/k/a" documentation coupled with a
    description and photograph of the fugitive is sufficient to
    establish a prima facie showing of identity. Cates v. Sullivan,
    696 P.2d 322 (Colo. 1985).</P>
    <P>
    <B>Clear and convincing evidence must be shown by
    accused</B>that he is not the person sought in order to rebut
    the prima facie showing of identity. Guy v. Nelson, 630 P.2d
    610 (Colo. 1981).</P>
    <P>Where petitioner failed to introduce evidence that he was
    not the person described in the requisition documents and the
    cross-examination of the respondents' witnesses did not create
    such evidence, the petitioner failed to establish that he was
    not the person described in the documents. Council v.
    MacFarlane, 709 P.2d 947 (Colo. 1985).</P>
    <P>
    <B>Statutory citation not required to be included within
    indictment.</B>Samples v. Cronin, 189 Colo. 40, 536 P.2d 306
    (1975).</P>
    <P>
    <B>An information not required with indictment.</B>The trial
    court was in error to discharge a fugitive for lack of an
    information for no such information is required. It is
    sufficient that a certified copy of the indictment, charging
    the passing of a worthless check, and other papers relating
    thereto, including a requisition, were forwarded from the
    governor of Tennessee and that the governor of Colorado issued
    a warrant for petitioner's arrest on the basis of such papers.
    Capra v. Miller, 161 Colo. 448, 422 P.2d 636 (1967).</P>
    <P>
    <B>The statement required by the extradition statute may be
    contained in the documents appended to the form of
    demand</B>since the requisitioning governor certifies the
    accuracy of these documents. Wynsma v. Leach, 189 Colo. 59, 536
    P.2d 817 (1975).</P>
    <P>
    <B>Statements as to escape and copy of judgment are
    sufficient.</B>In cases where persons are sought as escapees
    from state prison, all that is required for extradition is
    either a copy of the judgment of conviction or of a sentence
    imposed in execution thereof, together with a statement by the
    executive authority of the demanding state that the person
    claimed has escaped from confinement. Burnette v. McClearn, 162
    Colo. 503, 427 P.2d 331 (1967); Holmes v. People, 169 Colo.
    371, 456 P.2d 731 (1969).</P>
    <P>Where a demand is for a person whose judgment of conviction
    remains unsatisfied, the demand shall be accompanied by a copy
    of the judgment of conviction or of the sentence imposed in
    execution thereof, together with a statement by the executive
    authority of the demanding state that the person claimed has
    escaped from confinement or broken the terms of his bail,
    probation, or parole. Byers v. Leach, 187 Colo. 312, 530 P.2d
    1276 (1975).</P>
    <P>
    <B>Affidavit of sheriff in extraditing jurisdiction held
    sufficient.</B>Weathers v. Sullivan, 184 Colo. 39, 518 P.2d 842
    (1974).</P>
    <P>
    <B>Fact that signature of South Carolina solicitor on
    indictment was made by his deputy did not preclude
    extradition</B>of fugitive to South Carolina where procedure of
    having deputy sign solicitor's name to an indictment was proper
    and routine in South Carolina. Nevard v. Conn, 187 Colo. 168,
    529 P.2d 305 (1974).</P>
    <P>
    <B>Authentication of demanding governor is sufficient.</B>In
    the absence of a showing that any of the documents
    authenticated by a governor are spurious the certificate of the
    governor is sufficient. Travis v. People, 135 Colo. 141, 308
    P.2d 997 (1957); Tinsley v. Woods, 135 Colo. 590, 313 P.2d 1006
    (1957).</P>
    <P>The question of authenticity is one for the determination of
    the governor of the demanding state alone, and his
    certification of that fact is all that is required. Burnette v.
    McClearn, 162 Colo. 503, 427 P.2d 331 (1967); Byers v. Leach,
    187 Colo. 312, 530 P.2d 1276 (1975).</P>
    <P>Where governor of demanding state personally certifies to
    authenticity of extradition papers according to laws of
    demanding state, requirements of section in regard to
    authentication are met. People v. Jackson, 180 Colo. 135, 502
    P.2d 1106 (1972).</P>
    <P>Where the requisition signed by the governor of Arizona
    clearly reflected that the indictment was authenticated, and in
    the absence of any showing by the accused that the
    authenticated documents are spurious, the requisition must be
    considered to be adequate and sufficient to support an
    extradition order. Rush v. Baker, 188 Colo. 136, 533 P.2d 36
    (1975).</P>
    <P>Certification of extradition documents is not defective
    because there is no authorization included to show that the
    chief deputy clerk could sign for the clerk of the court when
    the demanding state's governor's authentication covers all the
    documents including the affidavits of probable cause and the
    arrest warrant. Absent some showing that the documents are
    spurious, the governor's general authentication establishes
    their validity. Keefer v. Leach, 198 Colo. 101, 597 P.2d 203
    (1979).</P>
    <P>The only authentication required by § 16-19-104 is an
    authentication by the executive authority of the demanding
    state. Clark v. Leach, 200 Colo. 151, 612 P.2d 1130 (1980);
    Butcher v. Caldwell, 677 P.2d 342 (Colo. 1984).</P>
    <P>
    <B>Governor's authentication covers all documents.</B>A
    governor's general authentication, included in the requisition
    documents, covers all documents included in the requisition
    request. Blackwell v. Johnson, 647 P.2d 237 (Colo. 1982).</P>
    <P>
    <B>Requisition document signed by one other than governor.</B>A
    requisition document, signed by one other than the governor of
    the demanding state, is valid so long as the capacity of the
    signator to act on behalf of the governor is duly
    authenticated. Hershberger v. Black, 645 P.2d 278 (Colo.
    1982).</P>
    <P>
    <B>Petitioner's burden to overcome presumption that extradition
    papers properly signed.</B>The burden of proof is on the
    petitioner to overcome the presumption that the person signing
    the extradition papers had the authority to do so. Hershberger
    v. Black, 645 P.2d 278 (Colo. 1982).</P>

    312, 530 P.2d 1276 (1975).</P>
    <P>
    <B>Indictments need not specifically attest that their
    certification was authorized.</B>The copy of the indictments
    accompanying the request for extradition need not specifically
    attest that the officer of the court who certified the copies
    of the indictments was authorized to do so. Furman v. Miller,
    198 Colo. 282, 598 P.2d 1042 (1979).</P>
    <P>
    <B>Charging documents accompanying demand for extradition must
    be verified by executive authority.</B>The requirements of this
    statute are clear as to which of the documents accompanying the
    demand for extradition must be authenticated by the executive
    authority making the demand. They are, "the copy of indictment,
    information, affidavit, judgment of conviction or sentence". In
    other words, it is the charging document. People v. Lent, 187
    Colo. 248, 529 P.2d 1317 (1975).</P>
    <P>
    <B>Minor discrepancies or inconsistencies in the requisition

    Griffith v. Nelson, 647 P.2d 228 (Colo. 1982).</P>
    <P>A minor discrepancy in the charge set forth in the

    659 P.2d 1389 (Colo. 1983).</P>
    <P>As long as the requisition documents substantially comply

    Cates v. Sullivan, 696 P.2d 322 (Colo. 1985).</P>
    <P>Immaterial clerical inconsistencies do not affect the
    validity of the governor's warrant. Morris v. Nelson, 659 P.2d
    1386 (Colo. 1983).</P>
    <P>Although a charging document must be phrased substantially
    in accordance with the statutory language, minor discrepancies
    will not prevent extradition if the substantive statutory
    standards are met. Furman v. Miller, 198 Colo. 282, 598 P.2d
    1042 (1979).</P>
    <P>Where the documents substantially charge the defendant with
    having committed a crime under the laws of another state,
    clerical errors do not render the extradition documents invalid
    or prevent extradition. Wilson v. Johnson, 645 P.2d 21 (Colo.
    1982).</P>
    <P>Where the only difference between an authenticated copy and
    the original indictment relates to the manner in which those
    signatures are described on the copy, such difference does not
    impair the genuineness of the signatures on the original
    indictment nor the authenticity of the copy, and this
    authenticated copy satisfied the requirements of this section.
    Griffith v. Nelson, 647 P.2d 228 (Colo. 1982).</P>
    <P>Demanding state is not required to allege every element of
    crime for which extradition is sought and charging documents
    are sufficient if framed substantially in the language
    contained in the statute. Johnson v. Cronin, 690 P.2d 1277
    (Colo. 1984).</P>
    <P>
    <B>Technical discrepancy in middle name insufficient to defeat
    extradition.</B>Under summary proceedings, sole reliance on a
    technical discrepancy in a middle name, when appellant does not
    allege or represent that he is not the fugitive, will not
    suffice to defeat extradition. Beverly v. Davis, 648 P.2d 621
    (Colo. 1982); Beam v. McKinster, 652 P.2d 618 (Colo. 1982).</P>
    <P>Where there is a discrepancy between the middle initial
    contained in the extradition documents and the governor's
    warrant and the initial claimed by the accused as being
    correct, a prima facie case of identity may be established by
    an appropriate affidavit and photograph. Miller v. Debekker,
    668 P.2d 927 (Colo. 1983).</P>
    <P>
    <B>Discrepancy as to height insufficient to defeat
    extradition.</B>A discrepancy between an extradition document
    from a demanding state and a governor's warrant issued pursuant
    thereto in this state, as to the height of the person in
    custody, is not clear and convincing evidence that the detainee
    is not the person named in the extradition document. Tackett v.
    Leach, 661 P.2d 1160 (Colo. 1983).</P>
    <P>Evidence of fugitive's own admissions relating to alleged
    offenses sufficient to overcome technical discrepancy in

    extradition. Edmonds v. Andrews, 696 P.2d 325 (Colo. 1985).</P>
    <P>
    <B>Clerical defects did not require reversal.</B>Clerical
    defects in extradition papers, such as the failure of the
    governor of North Dakota to insert in one the day and month on
    which he signed it, and in another, the day cannot be the basis
    for a reversal. Fox v. People, 161 Colo. 163, 420 P.2d 412

    requiring that return be made "as soon as the prosecution in
    this state is terminated" is an affirmative duty that the
    general assembly has imposed in the executive, is clearly
    intended to provide a standard to the state of origin,
    informing that state as to the proper time for demand, and
    gives the governor of Colorado a standard for determining when
    a demand for return is both timely and proper. Watson v.

    complied with § 16-19-104 although the requisition documents
    contained both a demand for extradition, pursuant to §
    16-19-103, and a request for extradition predicated on this
    section, which controls executive agreements, since the
    executive agreement, which accompanied the requisition
    documents, served only to ensure that the demanding state would
    return and surrender defendant to the Colorado authorities upon
    the completion of the trial in the demanding state. Buffalo v.

    request that Colorado authorities notify it 60 days prior to
    the petitioner's release so that his consecutive sentence could
    be served there. The request for notification is no more than a
    "flagging device", which allows the requesting state to take
    whatever action it deems appropriate. Moore v. Ricketts, 654

    <B>State not constitutionally required to deliver

    <P>
    <B>Which is exercisable pursuant to demand.</B>The governor of
    Colorado has no inherent powers of arrest and surrender and
    cannot proceed as a volunteer but is limited to acting pursuant
    to a demand or a request from the executive of a sister state,
    and then only in strict conformity with law. Matthews v.
    People, 136 Colo. 102, 314 P.2d 906 (1957).</P>
    <P>The governor's discretion is not a completely arbitrary one,
    but can be exercised only upon a lawful demand or request from
    the executive authority of another state to surrender only
    those persons in this state who have been charged by the
    demanding state with committing an act in this state or a third
    state which intentionally results in a crime in the demanding
    state. The governor cannot proceed as a volunteer, but must act
    in strict conformity with the law. Conrad v. McClearn, 166
    Colo. 568, 445 P.2d 222 (1968).</P>
    <P>
    <B>And warrant for fugitive ineffective where request concerns
    nonfugitive.</B>A warrant issued for the arrest of defendant as
    a fugitive from the justice of a sister state, where the facts
    disclosed that he was charged with violation of the reciprocal
    nonsupport act and had never been in that sister state except
    to pass through, was unlawful and void and he cannot be
    extradited as a fugitive. Matthews v. People, 136 Colo. 102,
    314 P.2d 906 (1957).</P>
    <P>Where demand is made for the arrest and delivery pursuant to
    the constitution and laws of the United States under §
    16-19-103 pertaining to fugitives, and arrest and surrender are
    made pursuant to the laws of the state of Colorado under this
    section, the warrant issued is not in accordance with the
    requisition; consequently, it is wholly ineffectual for any
    purpose. Layher v. Van Cleave, 171 Colo. 465, 468 P.2d 32
    (1970).</P>
    <P>
    <B>But subsequent extradition not barred by defective prior
    proceeding.</B>Prior grant of writ of habeas corpus in
    extradition proceedings on ground that rendition papers allege
    that petitioner is fugitive when it is admitted that he is not
    a fugitive does not bar, under doctrine of res judicata, a
    subsequent attempt at extradition where facts and issues are
    different from those raised by the first petition. Boyd v. Van

    <B>Extradition available to enforce support

    Enforcement of Support Act" in Colorado there are now two
    distinct courses of action which a demanding state may take
    with respect to one who does not carry out his obligations of
    support to his family: (1) Extradition on a criminal charge of
    nonsupport; and (2) the initiation of civil proceedings under
    the uniform act. Either or both courses of action may be
    pursued, and the election lies wholly with the demanding state

    together with the warrant show that the executive of the asylum
    state did in fact have before him the necessary jurisdictional
    matters, namely the documents required for the issuance of the
    warrant, then the prisoner is not illegally restrained. Self v.

    <P>
    <B>Governor's warrant is prima facie evidence of

    <P>The warrant of the governor of the asylum state is prima

    that he is a fugitive from the justice of that state; and (3)
    that a demand has been made for his delivery to the state
    wherein he is charged with a crime. Harding v. People, 161
    Colo. 571, 423 P.2d 847 (1967).</P>
    <P>It is sufficient that the governor's warrant of the asylum
    state recite that defendant is a fugitive from justice in the

    recitals therein. Capra v. Miller, 161 Colo. 448, 422 P.2d 636
    (1967).</P>
    <P>The governor's warrant of the asylum state is prima facie
    evidence that the accused was substantially charged with a
    crime under the laws of the demanding state, and that accused
    fled from justice after committing a felony in the demanding
    state. Mote v. Koch, 173 Colo. 82, 476 P.2d 255 (1970).</P>
    <P>
    <B>And of authority to arrest and deliver defendant.</B>Where
    the Colorado warrant recites that defendant is a fugitive from
    justice and that he stands charged with a crime, and it is
    accompanied by a certified copy of the indictment, it is prima
    facie sufficient authority for the arrest of the defendant and
    delivery of him to the agents duly appointed to return him to
    the demanding state. Capra v. Miller, 161 Colo. 448, 422 P.2d
    636 (1967).</P>
    <P>
    <B>Thus, process of arrest in first instance becomes moot and
    academic, when replaced by governor's warrant.</B>McClearn v.
    Jones, 162 Colo. 354, 426 P.2d 192 (1967); Luker v. Koch, 176
    Colo. 75, 489 P.2d 191 (1971).</P>
    <P>The governor's warrant for defendant's arrest for
    extradition having issued and having been filed, the issue as
    to whether he was lawfully arrested by an unverified
    information in the first instance is not just academic but
    moot. Velazquez v. People, 154 Colo. 284, 389 P.2d 849
    (1964).</P>
    <P>Once the governor's warrant is filed in the district court,
    irregularity in connection with prior proceedings becomes moot.
    Dressel v. Bianco, 168 Colo. 517, 452 P.2d 756 (1969).</P>
    <P>Alleged illegality of the process of arrest involved in an
    initial arrest in the asylum state becomes moot upon the
    issuance of a governor's warrant. Dilworth v. Leach, 183 Colo.
    206, 515 P.2d 1130 (1973).</P>
    <P>Once the governor's warrant has been issued, the question of
    the validity of the initial arrest becomes moot and may not be
    raised in habeas corpus proceedings which test the validity of
    the detention under the governor's warrant. McCoy v. Cronin,
    187 Colo. 364, 531 P.2d 379 (1975).</P>
    <P>After a valid governor's warrant is issued and served,
    illegalities and irregularities which relate to the initial
    arrest of the fugitive become moot. White v. Leach, 188 Colo.
    62, 532 P.2d 740 (1975).</P>
    <P>
    <B>It is unnecessary to execute the governor's warrant by
    rearresting when accused has already been arrested</B>and is
    free on bond. McClearn v. Jones, 162 Colo. 354, 426 P.2d 192

    <P>
    <B>But warrant for fugitive ineffective where request concerns
    nonfugitive.</B>A warrant charging petitioner as a fugitive
    from the justice of a sister state for failure to support his
    minor children is not supported by a showing that petitioner's
    wife left him and removed to the sister state with their
    children, and that petitioner has never been in that state
    except to pass through, and hence he cannot be extradited as a
    fugitive. Matthews v. People, 136 Colo. 102, 314 P.2d 906
    (1957).</P>
    <P>Where demand is made for arrest and delivery pursuant to the

    of persons not present where crime committed, the warrant
    issued is not in accordance with the requisition; consequently,
    it is wholly ineffectual for any purpose. Layher v. Van Cleave,

    misspelling of petitioner's name in documents supporting
    governor's warrant was immaterial. Dilworth v. Leach, 183 Colo.

    <P>
    <B>Presumption of named person's presence in demanding state at
    time of offense.</B>The issuance of a governor's warrant for a
    person whose name is identical to that of the person charged in
    the fugitive information establishes a presumption that he was
    in the demanding state at the time of the offense. Richardson
    v. Cronin, 621 P.2d 949 (Colo. 1980).</P>
    <P>
    <B>Inclusion of two surnames in Texas governor's warrant served
    dual function</B>of adequately identifying the person sought
    and of authorizing peace officers in Colorado to arrest that
    person as a fugitive, and was consistent with the governor's
    statutory extradition authority. Richardson v. Cronin, 621 P.2d

    <B>Governor's warrant need not be technically correct in every

    <B>Applicable to all prisoners.</B>Under the extradition act,

    <P>An extradition hearing is not designed or intended to

    <P>
    <B>Habeas corpus proceedings are civil rather than
    criminal</B>in nature, concerned only with the prisoner's right
    to liberty, notwithstanding the particular act for which he is
    detained, and is separate from the legal proceedings under
    which the detention is sought to be justified. Luker v. Koch,
    176 Colo. 75, 489 P.2d 191 (1971).</P>
    <P>Habeas corpus is an independent civil proceeding separate
    and apart from the case in which the criminal charge which
    initiates the extradition proceedings is filed. People v. Lent,

    District Court, 177 Colo. 381, 494 P.2d 596 (1972).</P>
    <P>Despite a common-law and constitutional tradition which
    treat habeas corpus as a civil matter and as a matter to which
    criminal due process safeguards do not attach, the supreme
    court is of the opinion that this tradition does not comport
    with recent developments in the constitutional law. The
    administration of criminal procedural safeguards must look
    beyond form to substance. Mora v. District Court, 177 Colo.
    381, 494 P.2d 596 (1972).</P>
    <P>
    <B>Section provides right to counsel.</B>The language of this
    section establishes a right to the presence of legal counsel,

    to indigents when it has been made available to those able to
    afford counsel. Mora v. District Court, 177 Colo. 381, 494 P.2d

    <P>
    <B>It requires advising by judge and counsel.</B>The statute
    expressly requires that a person arrested on a governor's

    demand made for his surrender and of the crime of which he is
    charged, and that he has a right to procure legal counsel to
    test the legality of his arrest. Conrad v. McClearn, 166 Colo.

    <P>
    <B>The only proper respondent in a habeas corpus proceeding is
    the person who allegedly is detaining the petitioner
    unlawfully,</B>and neither the governor nor the people of the

    Bryer, 150 Colo. 293, 372 P.2d 83 (1962).</P>
    <P>This section contemplates a hearing on the legality of the
    prisoner's detention, if he requests one, and such a hearing
    can be had only when a writ of habeas corpus has been duly
    applied for by the prisoner and issued by the court. Osborne v.
    Van Cleave, 166 Colo. 398, 443 P.2d 988 (1968).</P>
    <P>
    <B>Inquiry in habeas corpus proceeding severely
    restricted.</B>In the interests of comity and speedy resolution
    of extradition matters, the inquiry by the courts of Colorado,
    the asylum state, in a habeas corpus proceeding, is severely
    restricted, and the accused is left to pursue his remedies in
    the courts of the demanding state. Rush v. Baker, 188 Colo.
    136, 533 P.2d 36 (1975).</P>
    <P>
    <B>Scope of inquiry limited.</B>The scope of inquiry in a
    habeas corpus proceeding in the context of a request for
    extradition under this article is narrowly limited to the
    issues of: (1) The technical sufficiency of the extradition
    papers; (2) identification of the accused; (3) whether the
    accused is charged with a crime; and (4) whether the accused is
    a fugitive from justice. Lomax v. Cronin, 194 Colo. 523, 575
    P.2d 1285 (1978); Steinman v. Caldwell, 628 P.2d 110 (Colo.
    1981); Gagan v. Gately, 673 F. Supp. 1029 (D. Colo. 1987).</P>
    <P>At habeas corpus proceedings to consider the validity of an
    extradition warrant, the only questions which may be presented
    to the court by the habeas corpus petition are whether the
    prisoner is lawfully detained and whether the requirements of
    extradition have been met. Massey v. Wilson, 199 Colo. 121, 605
    P.2d 469 (1980); Simmons v. Leach, 626 P.2d 164 (Colo.
    1981).</P>
    <P>
    <B>When asylum state's court to make determination of probable
    cause.</B>The fourth amendment interests of a person against
    whom extradition is sought are protected upon a habeas corpus
    review where the courts of the asylum state examine the
    extradition documents to determine whether probable cause has
    been found by a neutral court in the demanding state. If no
    determination of probable cause by the courts of the demanding
    state appears in the extradition documents, the courts in the
    asylum state are required to make an independent determination
    from the extradition documents as to whether probable cause
    exists. Lutrell v. Williams, 660 P.2d 499 (Colo. 1983).</P>
    <P>
    <B>Courts in asylum state have no duty to inquire into
    substantive law and pleading practices</B>of the demanding
    state. Simmons v. Leach, 626 P.2d 164 (Colo. 1981).</P>
    <P>
    <B>Court may not nullify extradition on own motion.</B>A trial
    court may not disregard the provisions of this section and of
    its own motion nullify an extradition warrant without the
    filing of a petition for a writ of habeas corpus by the accused
    showing substantial grounds why the extradition should not be
    enforced. Krutka v. Bryer, 150 Colo. 293, 372 P.2d 83
    (1962).</P>
    <P>
    <B>The accused has the right to proffer evidence in aid of his
    discharge.</B>Krutka v. Bryer, 150 Colo. 293, 372 P.2d 83
    (1962).</P>
    <P>
    <B>But not to try questions of guilt or innocence.</B>The guilt
    or innocence of the alleged fugitive may not be considered by
    the court of the asylum state in habeas corpus proceedings.
    Dressel v. Bianco, 168 Colo. 517, 452 P.2d 756 (1969).</P>
    <P>Since an extradition proceeding is designed only to convey
    the petitioner to the proper jurisdiction for trial, his guilt
    or innocence and any issue as to his sanity as it relates to
    his guilt or innocence or ability to stand trial are not issues
    at the extradition hearing, but rather at the trial in the
    demanding state. Luker v. Koch, 176 Colo. 75, 489 P.2d 191
    (1971).</P>
    <P>Although questions concerning the petitioner's sanity as it
    affects his ability to stand trial are properly addressed to
    courts in the demanding state, the petitioner's competency may
    also be the subject of inquiry by the asylum state if it
    affects the petitioner's ability to understand and assist
    counsel in handling the issues involved in the habeas corpus
    proceeding itself. Gagan v. Gately, 673 F. Supp. 1029 (D. Colo.
    1987).</P>
    <P>
    <B>Such as date of crime.</B>In an extradition hearing, the
    time of the commission of the crime is material; however, the
    precise date alleged does not necessarily have to be proved and
    where, for the purpose of extradition, trial court ruled that
    any date in a certain month was sufficient to advise accused of
    the charge against him, it was held that under the evidence and
    special circumstances of the case, trial court's ruling was
    correct. Osborne v. Van Cleave, 173 Colo. 26, 475 P.2d 625
    (1970).</P>
    <P>
    <B>Or alibi.</B>Habeas corpus is not the proper proceeding to
    try the question of alibi, or any question as to the guilt or
    innocence of the accused. Osborne v. Van Cleave, 173 Colo. 26,
    475 P.2d 625 (1970); Eathorne v. Nelson, 180 Colo. 288, 505
    P.2d 1 (1973).</P>
    <P>
    <B>Or validity of arrest or detention.</B>The fugitive cannot,
    in opposition to proper extradition proceedings, urge the fact
    that his original arrest or detention was illegal, once
    proceedings have been instituted, it is too late to claim that
    the preliminary detention in the asylum state was illegal.
    Travis v. People, 135 Colo. 141, 308 P.2d 996 (1957).</P>
    <P>The fact that the defendant was originally arrested in
    Colorado on a charge different than the one upheld by
    requisition is immaterial and moot. Extradition proceedings on
    the charge of passing a worthless check were properly
    instituted and the validity of his initial arrest is not in
    issue in the proceeding to determine whether the discharge of
    the person was valid. Capra v. Miller, 161 Colo. 448, 422 P.2d
    636 (1967).</P>
    <P>The illegality of an initial arrest cannot be challenged in
    an extradition proceeding growing out of that arrest. Luker v.
    Koch, 176 Colo. 75, 489 P.2d 191 (1971).</P>
    <P>Where accused petitioned for writ of habeas corpus after
    issuance of governor's warrant for accused's extradition to
    another state, any issue arising out of any alleged wrongful
    detention preceding the service of the governor's warrant was
    moot. Crumrine v. Erickson, 186 Colo. 139, 526 P.2d 148
    (1974).</P>
    <P>Once the governor's warrant has been issued, the question of
    the validity of the initial arrest becomes moot and may not be
    raised in habeas corpus proceedings which test the validity of
    the detention under the governor's warrant. McCoy v. Cronin,
    187 Colo. 364, 531 P.2d 379 (1975).</P>
    <P>After a valid governor's warrant has been issued and served,
    any illegalities and irregularities which relate to the initial
    arrest of the fugitive become moot. Simmons v. Leach, 626 P.2d
    164 (Colo. 1981).</P>
    <P>
    <B>Or violations of parole.</B>In habeas corpus proceedings
    involving extradition the courts cannot consider the question
    of whether or not the petitioner has violated his parole.
    Travis v. People, 135 Colo. 141, 308 P.2d 997 (1957).</P>
    <P>
    <B>Or the constitutionality of statute charging crime in
    demanding state.</B>Accused could not avoid extradition to
    another state on argument that statute charging him with crime
    in other state was unconstitutional. Rather, the principle of
    comity required the accused to test the statute's
    constitutionality in the courts of that state. Denton v.
    Cronin, 187 Colo. 247, 529 P.2d 644 (1974).</P>
    <P>
    <B>Or death penalty.</B>Where accused proposes that Colorado
    ought not give aid and assistance to Oklahoma in enforcing its
    death penalty which he alleges is unconstitutional, this
    position presents no issue justiciable in the Colorado courts
    in an extradition proceeding. Pickinpaugh v. Lamm, 189 Colo.
    143, 538 P.2d 113 (1975).</P>
    <P>
    <B>Defendant's claim that his federal constitutional rights
    were violated in the asylum state</B>does not require habeas
    corpus relief, nor does it deprive the Colorado courts of
    jurisdiction over the defendant. Yellen v. Nelson, 680 P.2d 234
    (Colo. 1984).</P>
    <P>
    <B>Alleged denial of speedy trial and due process by demanding
    state.</B>Issues of whether petitioner has been denied his
    constitutional rights to a speedy trial and due process by
    demanding state's delay in proceeding with extradition are not
    justiciable in a habeas corpus action brought in Colorado
    grounded upon a demand for extradition. Simmons v. Leach, 626
    P.2d 164 (Colo. 1981).</P>
    <P>
    <B>When prisoner released for state's failure to comply with
    constitutional requirements, he remains subject to extradition
    proceedings.</B>When the prisoner is released because the
    demanding state or the asylum state has failed to comply with
    statutory or constitutional requirements, the prisoner remains
    a fugitive from the demanding state and subject to that state's
    constitutional right to demand his return. Massey v. Wilson,
    199 Colo. 121, 605 P.2d 469 (1980).</P>
    <P>
    <B>Effect of writ on prosecution of underlying charge.</B>Where
    New Mexico properly granted a writ of habeas corpus on the
    grounds of technical insufficiency of the extradition
    documents, Colorado is not estopped from prosecuting the
    defendant on the merits of the underlying charges. People v.
    Coyle, 654 P.2d 815 (Colo. 1982).</P>
    <P>
    <B>Courts of asylum state may not consider certain
    allegations.</B>The courts of the asylum state in a habeas
    corpus proceeding under this article may not properly consider
    allegations that the fugitive's life would be endangered by
    return to the demanding state. The accused, in respect to this
    matter, must pursue his remedies in the demanding state or with
    the executive of the asylum state. Lomax v. Cronin, 194 Colo.
    523, 575 P.2d 1285 (1978).</P>
    <P>
    <B>Identification testimony at extradition hearing is not
    tested by same standards applied at trial</B>on the merits.
    Eathorne v. Nelson, 180 Colo. 288, 505 P.2d 1 (1973).</P>
    <P>
    <B>Sanity a question only if accused unable to assist
    counsel.</B>The only conceivable situation in which a court in
    the asylum state might be required to consider sanity would be
    one in which the petitioner is so incompetent as to be totally

    <B>Issue is right of demanding state to defendant's
    return.</B>Constitutional rights to limitations on the use of
    evidence on the issue of guilt or innocence are not at issue in
    the rendition proceeding. What is in issue is the
    constitutional right of the demanding state to have the
    defendant promptly returned to that state on a showing of
    probable cause. North v. Koch, 169 Colo. 508, 457 P.2d 915
    (1969).</P>
    <P>
    <B>This involves narrow determination of compliance with
    statute.</B>Habeas corpus, in the instance of interstate
    extradition, involves a narrow determination of whether there
    has been compliance with the statutory elements of whether the
    petitioner: (1) Was present in the demanding state at the time
    charged in the governor's warrant and the extradition
    proceedings; (2) was substantially charged with a crime; and
    (3) is a fugitive from justice. Petition of Harwell, 180 Colo.
    144, 503 P.2d 618 (1972).</P>
    <P>The scope of inquiry in habeas corpus proceedings is
    narrowly limited to the technical sufficiency of the papers
    and: (1) The identification of the accused; (2) whether the
    accused has been charged with a crime; and (3) whether the
    accused is a fugitive from justice. Luker v. Koch, 176 Colo.
    75, 489 P.2d 191 (1971).</P>
    <P>A habeas corpus proceeding has limited scope and is intended
    to resolve the issue of whether the person in custody is
    lawfully detained. Eathorne v. Nelson, 180 Colo. 288, 505 P.2d
    1 (1973).</P>
    <P>
    <B>Evidence required to overcome presumption of validity.</B>An
    accused who seeks to invalidate an extradition must overcome
    the presumption of validity afforded by the governor's warrant
    by clear and convincing evidence. Lomax v. Cronin, 194 Colo.
    523, 575 P.2d 1285 (1978).</P>

    <B>The warrant of arrest is prima facie evidence of the
    recitals therein</B>in a habeas corpus proceeding. Capra v.
    Miller, 161 Colo. 448, 422 P.2d 636 (1967).</P>
    <P>The warrant of the governor as to the status of the accused
    as a fugitive from justice of the demanding state is prima
    facie proof of such status which must be overcome to justify a
    discharge from custody. Krutka v. Bryer, 150 Colo. 293, 372
    P.2d 83 (1962).</P>
    <P>
    <B>It places the burden upon the accused</B>to show either that
    he is not a fugitive from justice or that he was not
    substantially charged with a crime in the demanding state.
    Capra v. Miller, 161 Colo. 448, 422 P.2d 636 (1967).</P>
    <P>A petitioner who believes that the demanding state's
    requisition papers do not support the warrant of the governor
    of the asylum state has the responsibility of going forward
    with the matter and controvert the warrant by introducing the
    requisition papers into evidence. Mote v. Koch, 173 Colo. 82,
    476 P.2d 255 (1970).</P>
    <P>
    <B>The burden is to show by clear and convincing evidence that
    defendant was absent at the time of the crime</B>charged from
    Texas. Dressel v. Bianco, 168 Colo. 517, 452 P.2d 756
    (1969).</P>
    <P>The courts will not discharge a defendant arrested under a
    governor's warrant where there is merely contradictory evidence
    on the subject of presence in or absence from the state.
    Osborne v. Van Cleave, 173 Colo. 26, 475 P.2d 625 (1970);
    Eathorne v. Nelson, 180 Colo. 288, 505 P.2d 1 (1973).</P>
    <P>The burden is upon the accused to come forward with clear
    and convincing proof that he was not in the demanding state at
    the time of the crime charged or that he was not the fugitive
    from justice named in the extradition papers, in order to
    overcome the presumption which attaches to the governor's
    warrant that the accused was in the demanding state at the time
    of the crime. Luker v. Koch, 176 Colo. 75, 489 P.2d 191
    (1971).</P>
    <P>Absence from the demanding state is a defense which may be
    raised and proven by a petitioner in order to defeat
    extradition. Luker v. Koch, 176 Colo. 75, 489 P.2d 191
    (1971).</P>
    <P>A habeas corpus petitioner charged as an out-of-state
    fugitive, not the sheriff-respondent, has the burden of going
    forward with clear and convincing evidence to prove that he was
    not in the demanding state at the time of the crime or that he
    is not the individual named in the extradition papers. Ede v.
    Bray, 178 Colo. 99, 495 P.2d 1139 (1972).</P>
    <P>The burden is on the accused to show by clear and
    satisfactory evidence that he was not present if he is to
    overcome the presumption created by the warrant which governor
    of Colorado issues that the accused is in the demanding state
    at the time the offense was committed. Eathorne v. Nelson, 180
    Colo. 288, 505 P.2d 1 (1973).</P>
    <P>
    <B>Or that he had not left the state.</B>To demonstrate that he
    was not a fugitive from justice, the defendant would have to
    show either that he was not present in the state demanding
    extradition at the time that the crime allegedly was committed,
    or that he had not left the state. Fox v. People, 161 Colo.
    163, 420 P.2d 412 (1966).</P>
    <P>The presumption raised by a governor's warrant in an asylum
    state in a habeas corpus proceeding may be overcome either by a
    petitioner showing that he was not within the demanding state
    at the time the crime was committed or that he has not since
    left the state. Harding v. People, 161 Colo. 571, 423 P.2d 847
    (1967); Luker v. Koch, 176 Colo. 75, 489 P.2d 191 (1971).</P>
    <P>
    <B>Burden shifted to petitioner to disprove identity.</B>Where
    the petitioner's name in the requisition of governor of New
    Mexico was identical to the name appearing in the Colorado
    governor's warrant, this created a prima facie showing of
    identity and shifted the burden to petitioner to disprove the
    identity. Dilworth v. Leach, 183 Colo. 206, 515 P.2d 1130
    (1973).</P>
    <P>The introduction of the governor's warrant and the
    supporting requisition documents created a prima facie showing
    of identity and shifted the burden to appellant to show that
    the state did not properly identify him as the person sought by
    the requisitioning state. Dominguez v. Bray, 188 Colo. 72, 532
    P.2d 950 (1975).</P>
    <P>
    <B>Photo competent evidence of identity.</B>Where an
    authenticated prison photo of the petitioner accompanied the
    extradition documents from New Mexico, the photo was competent
    evidence of identity. Dilworth v. Leach, 183 Colo. 206, 515
    P.2d 1130 (1973).</P>
    <P>
    <B>State allowed time to cure defective affidavit.</B>In a
    habeas corpus proceeding a state should be permitted a
    reasonable time to cure a defective extradition affidavit, but
    if the affidavit is not cured within 15 days the writ of habeas
    corpus becomes absolute, and the accused is entitled to release
    from custody. People v. McFall, 175 Colo. 151, 486 P.2d 6
    (1971).</P>
    <P>It is within the trial court's discretion to allow a
    reasonable time for correction of defective extradition
    documents instead of causing the entire process to be repeated.
    Williams v. Leach, 194 Colo. 374, 572 P.2d 481 (1977).</P>
    <P>
    <B>Failure of sheriff to make formal return to writ not
    prejudicial.</B>While the better and approved practice is for a
    sheriff to make a formal return to a writ of habeas corpus in
    an extradition matter, where all extradition documents were
    before the trial court and the validity of the detention was
    determined without objection that such formal return had not
    been filed, and the substantial rights of the petitioner were
    not adversely affected thereby, he cannot be heard to complain
    for the first time in the supreme court that no formal return
    was made. Bright v. Foster, 150 Colo. 559, 374 P.2d 865
    (1962).</P>
    <P>
    <B>Nor was failure of district attorney to answer
    interrogatories.</B>Where a district attorney failed to answer
    all interrogatories served upon him by a habeas corpus
    petitioner questioning extradition proceedings, which
    interrogatories involved matters entirely foreign to the rather
    limited issues involved in an extradition proceeding, any error
    arising out of such failure on the part of the district
    attorney could not have been prejudicial. Mote v. Koch, 173

    <B>This section exclusively governs questions of bail for
    defendants awaiting extradition prior to service of a
    governor's warrant.</B>Fullerton v. County Court, 124 P.3d 866
    (Colo. App. 2005). 
    <P>
    <B>Bond conditioned upon surrender under governor's
    warrant.</B>When a person has been arrested prior to
    requisition for a crime in another state and thereafter is
    admitted to bail, such bond shall be conditioned upon his
    appearance at the time specified for his surrender upon the
    warrant of the governor of this state for his extradition or
    interstate rendition to another state. McClearn v. Jones, 162
    Colo. 354, 426 P.2d 192 (1967).</P>
    <P>
    <B>Prior to service of a governor's warrant, a trial court is
    authorized to require bond for a defendant pending extradition
    in any type necessary, including a "cash only" bond, to secure
    the defendant's appearance.</B>Fullerton v. County Court, 124
    P.3d 866 (Colo. App. 2005).</P>
    <P>
    <B>Unnecessary to rearrest upon filing of governor's
    warrant.</B>The clear meaning and purport of this section is
    that when a person has been arrested prior to requisition in
    accordance with § 16-19-114 and is thereafter admitted to bail,
    the bond being returnable on a specified date, it is
    unnecessary to rearrest such person upon the issuance and
    filing in court of the governor's warrant. Appearance on the
    day specified constitutes surrender upon the governor's
    warrant. McClearn v. Jones, 162 Colo. 354, 426 P.2d 192
    (1967).</P>
    <P>
    <B>No right to bail exists after governor's warrant has been
    served</B>and pending decision on a habeas corpus petition in
    the trial court because, where the fugitive is being held for
    another state, he should be readily available to be turned over
    to those who arrive to return him. A special obligation to
    deliver a fugitive is owed to a sister state -- an obligation
    which makes bail inappropriate after the stage when issuance of
    the governor's warrant is reached. Johnson v. District Court,
    199 Colo. 458, 610 P.2d 1064 (1980).</P>
    <P>
    <B>Legislative intent to deny bail after service of
    warrant.</B>The lack of an absolute right to bail after service
    of the governor's warrant does not mean that the court has lost
    its inherent power to grant bail after that time, but simply
    reflects a determination that the legislative intent to deny
    bail after service of the governor's warrant is a reasonable
    and appropriate limitation on that power absent the most
    extraordinary circumstances. Johnson v. District Court, 199
    Colo. 458, 610 P.2d 1064 (1980).</P>
    <P>
    <B>Facts insufficient to permit bail after service of
    warrant.</B>That, at the time of his arrest, the defendant was
    employed as a welder, and could return to that work if bail
    were granted, that the defendant was a union and church member,
    and that his petition for bail was supported by many members of
    his church are facts which fall far short of establishing the
    extraordinary circumstances which must be shown to permit bail
    to be granted after service of a governor's warrant. Johnson v.
    District Court, 199 Colo. 458, 610 P.2d 1064 (1980).</P>
    <P>
    <B>The process involved in the arrest in the first instance
    becomes moot</B>and academic, when replaced and supplanted by
    the governor's warrant. McClearn v. Jones, 162 Colo. 354, 426
    P.2d 192 (1967).</P>
    <P>
    <B>Extension of time was within court's discretion.</B>Where
    the governor's warrant was issued on the same day the district
    attorney applied for and was granted the extension of time, and
    the defendant had shown no prejudice, the extension of time was
    clearly within the court's discretion. Norrod v. Bower, 187

  <M>Any person arrested in this state charged with having
  committed any crime in another state or alleged to have escaped
  from confinement or broken the terms of his or her bail,
  probation, or parole may waive the issuance and service of the
  warrant provided for in sections 16-19-108 and 16-19-109 and all
  other procedure incidental to extradition proceedings by
  executing or subscribing in the presence of a judge of any court
  of record within this state a writing which states that he or she
  consents to return to the demanding state and acknowledging that
  he or she shall not be admitted to bail; but, before the waiver
  is executed or subscribed by such person, it is the duty of the
  judge to inform such person of his or her rights to the issuance
  and service of a warrant of extradition and to obtain a writ of
  habeas corpus as provided for in section 16-19-111.</M>

  for withdrawing the waiver. If the court grants the withdrawal,

  withdrawal of the waiver of extradition. A judge shall commit a
  fugitive who is permitted to withdraw his or her waiver of
  extradition to the county jail without bond for a specified
  period of time, of not less than thirty days and not more than

  <M>In all cases where complaint is made against any fugitive from

  complainant good and sufficient security for the payment of all
  costs which may accrue from the arrest and detention of such
  fugitive, which security shall be by bond to the clerk of the

  as in other cases, to be served on the persons named in the bond,

  the sheriff, for which he shall be allowed the same fees as are
  given him for serving notices. If the fees are not paid on or
  before the first day of the next district court to be held in and
  for that county, nor any cause then shown why they should not be
  paid, the clerk may issue an execution for the same against those
  parties on whom the fee bill has been served and when the fees
  are collected shall pay over the same to the persons respectively
  entitled thereto. The clerk shall be entitled to one dollar for
  his trouble in each case, besides the usual taxed fees which are
  allowed in other cases for like services. Nothing contained in
  this section shall prevent the clerk from instituting suits on
  said bonds in the ordinary mode of judicial proceedings, if he
  deems it proper. The costs which may accrue from the arrest and
  detention of such fugitive, as described in this section, shall

  <M>Legislative declaration.</M></CATCH-LINE>(1)
  <M>The general assembly hereby finds and determines that, since
  1974, there have been proposals for an automated criminal justice
  information system that shares and tracks data concerning
  offenders among the various criminal justice agencies. Because
  each of the criminal justice agencies in the state has developed
  independent information systems to address each agency's own
  management and planning needs, the status of criminal justice
  information in the state has been fragmented.</M>
  <P N="(2)">(2)
  <M>The general assembly hereby declares that this article is
  enacted for the purpose of developing, operating, supporting,
  maintaining, and enhancing, in a cost-effective manner, a
  seamless, integrated criminal justice information system that
  maximizes standardization of data and communications technology
  among law enforcement agencies, district attorneys, the courts,
  and state-funded corrections for adult and youth offenders and
  other agencies as approved by the general assembly or by the
  executive board pursuant to this article. Such a system will
  improve:</M></P>
  <P N="(2)(a)">(a)
  <M>Public safety by making more timely, accurate, and complete
  information concerning offenders available statewide to all
  criminal justice agencies and to individual decision-makers in
  the criminal justice system, including but not limited to police
  officers, prosecutors, judges, probation officers, and
  corrections officers;</M></P>
  <P N="(2)(b)">(b)
  <M>Decision-making by increasing the availability of statistical
  measures for evaluating public policy;</M></P>
  <P N="(2)(c)">(c)
  <M>Productivity of existing staff by continually working toward
  eliminating redundant data collection and input efforts among the
  agencies and by reducing or eliminating paper-based
  processing;</M></P>
  <P N="(2)(d)">(d)
  <M>Access to timely, accurate, and complete information by both
  staff from all criminal justice agencies and the public when
  permitted by article 72 of title 24, C.R.S.</M></P>
  <P N="(3)">(3)
  <M>Because information about offenders collected by local law
  enforcement agencies may be the most current, the general
  assembly directs criminal justice agencies, where practical, to
  cooperate with and to encourage local law enforcement agencies to
  participate in the Colorado integrated criminal justice
  information system program developed under this article.</M></P>
  <P N="(4)">(4)
  <M>The general assembly hereby finds that the Colorado integrated
  criminal justice information system program has been successfully
  implemented and that the sharing of criminal justice information
  is being enhanced as a result. The general assembly further finds
  that there is a need to provide ongoing maintenance, support, and
  leadership for the continued operation and enhancement of the
  Colorado integrated criminal justice information system
  program.</M></P>
  <P N="(5)">(5)
  <M>The general assembly hereby finds and declares that the
  operation of the integrated criminal justice information system
  established by this article is critical to the accurate,
  complete, and timely performance of criminal background checks
  and to the effective communications between and among law
  enforcement, the state judicial department, and executive
  agencies and political subdivisions of the state. The general
  assembly further finds and declares that it is in the best
  interests of the citizens of the state and for the enhancement of
  public safety that the collaborative effort surrounding the
  integrated criminal justice information system be maintained,
  supported, and enhanced.</M></P></SECTION-TEXT>

    <B>Annotator's note.</B>Since § 16-22-102 is similar to §
    18-3-412.5 as it existed prior to its 2002 repeal and
    reenactment, a relevant case construing that provision has been
    included in the annotations to this section. 
    <P>
    <B>The sex offender registration act taken as a whole gives
    fair notice that "residence" applies to more than a traditional
    house or apartment, so it is not unconstitutionally vague as
    applied to defendant.</B>Defendant had fair notice that staying
    in his car may have triggered his registration duties. People
    v. Allman, 2012 COA 212, 321 P.3d 557.</P>
    <P>
    <B>In reference to the term "convicted" in subsection (3), the
    phrase "having received a deferred judgment and sentence" does
    not mean the same as "completing the terms of a deferred
    sentencing agreement".</B>Defendant must register as a sex
    offender pursuant to § 16-22-103 (1)(a) despite completion of a
    deferred sentencing agreement. Dubois v. Abrahamson, 214 P.3d
    586 (Colo. App. 2009).</P>
    <P>
    <B>A motor vehicle if used, intended to be used, or usually
    used for habitation may be a "residence", even if it is not
    parked in a fixed location.</B>People v. Allman, 2012 COA 212,
    321 P.3d 557.</P>
    <P>
    <B>The term "residence" does not require an address.</B>People
    v. Allman, 2012 COA 212, 321 P.3d 557.</P>
    <P>
    <B>The trial court properly ordered the defendant to register
    as a sex offender pursuant to this section even though
    defendant plead guilty to an offense not specifically listed in
    the definition of "unlawful sexual behavior" in subsection
    (1)(b).</B>Although defendant plead guilty to contributing to
    the delinquency of a minor, she had engaged in soliciting for
    child prostitution, pandering of a child, procurement of a
    child for sexual exploitation, and inducement of child
    prostitution. Thus, the factual basis for the plea involved
    unlawful sexual behavior, and defendant was appropriately
    required to register as a sex offender. People v. Meidinger,
    987 P.2d 937 (Colo. App. 1999).</P>
    <P>
    <B>To establish a residence under subsection (5.7)</B>requires
    a physical presence or occupancy at a location. An offender
    under the Colorado Sex Offender Registration Act is required to
    give notice of where he or she intends to reside upon release
    from custody, but is not required to register at an address
    solely based upon that intent. People v. Griffin, 397 P.3d 1086

  behavior, shall be required to register in the manner prescribed
  in section 16-22-104, section 16-22-106 or 16-22-107, whichever
  is applicable, and section 16-22-108.</M></P>
  <P N="(2)(b)">(b)
  <M>A person shall be deemed to have been convicted of unlawful

  <N></N>(I)
  <M>For convictions entered on or after July 1, 2002, a person

  if:</M></P>
  <P N="(2)(c)(I)(A)">(A)

  <M>The person was originally charged with unlawful sexual
  behavior or with an offense that meets the description in
  sub-subparagraph (A) or (B) of this subparagraph (I), the person
  pleads guilty to an offense that does not constitute unlawful

  sexual behavior; or</M></P>
  <P N="(2)(c)(I)(D)">(D)
  <M>The person was charged with and convicted of an offense that

  behavior.</M></P>

  <M>If a person is originally charged with unlawful sexual
  behavior or with an offense that meets the description in
  sub-subparagraph (A) or (B) of subparagraph (I) of this paragraph
  (c), the court may accept a plea agreement to an offense that
  does not constitute unlawful sexual behavior only if:</M></P>

  <P N="(2)(c)(III)">(III)
  <M>The advisement provided for purposes of this paragraph (c), in
  addition to meeting the requirements of the Colorado rules of
  criminal procedure, shall advise the person that admitting that
  the underlying factual basis of the offense to which the person
  is pleading or of which the person is convicted involves unlawful
  sexual behavior will have the collateral result of making the
  person subject to the requirements of this article.
  Notwithstanding any provision of this paragraph (c) to the
  contrary, failure to advise a person pursuant to the provisions
  of this subparagraph (III) shall not constitute a defense to the
  offense of failure to register as a sex offender if there is
  evidence that the defendant had actual notice of the duty to
  register.</M></P>
  <P N="(2)(c)(IV)">(IV)
  <M>In any case in which a person is deemed to have been convicted

  <P N="(2)(d)(III)">(III)
  <M>The procedures established by the department of corrections to

  <P N="(2)(d)(III)(B)">(B)
  <M>The offender's attorney be permitted to attend, represent, and

  <P N="(2)(d)(III)(C)">(C)
  <M>The offender be entitled to written notice of the reason for

  present witnesses and documentary evidence, the right to confront
  and cross-examine adverse witnesses, unless the administrative
  hearing officer finds good cause for not allowing confrontation,
  and written findings and conclusions indicating the evidence and
  reasons relied upon for the classification as a sex

  <P N="(2)(d)(IV)">(IV)
  <M>Notwithstanding any statutory provisions to the contrary, the

  2003", Pub.L. 108-79, as amended.</M></P>
  <P N="(3)(a)">(3)
  <N></N>(a)
  <M>In addition to the persons specified in subsections (1) and
  (2) of this section, and except as set forth in subsection (3)(b)
  of this section, any person convicted of an offense in any other
  state or jurisdiction, including but not limited to a military or
  federal jurisdiction, for which the person, as a result of the
  conviction, is required to register if the person resided in the
  state or jurisdiction of conviction, or for which the person
  would be required to register if convicted in Colorado, is
  required to register in the manner specified in section
  16-22-108, so long as the person is a temporary or permanent
  resident of Colorado. The person may petition the court for an
  order to discontinue the requirement for registration in this
  state at the times specified in section 16-22-113 for offense
  classifications that are comparable to the classification of the
  offense for which the person was convicted in the other state or
  jurisdiction. The person may petition the court for an order to
  discontinue the requirement for registration in this state for
  offense classifications that the person would not be required to
  register for if convicted in Colorado.</M></P>
  <P N="(3)(b)">(b)
  <M>If a juvenile is required to register only pursuant to
  subsection (3)(a) of this section and the juvenile's duty to
  register in another state or jurisdiction has been terminated by
  a court order, or if a trial court has determined that the
  juvenile is not required to register in that state or
  jurisdiction, then the juvenile is not required to fulfill the
  requirements for registration in Colorado, as set forth in
  section 16-22-108, and is therefore not required to petition the
  court for removal from the Colorado sex offender registry
  pursuant to section 16-22-113.</M></P>
  <P N="(4)">(4)
  <M>This article 22 applies to any person who receives a
  disposition or is adjudicated a juvenile delinquent based on the
  commission of any act that may constitute unlawful sexual
  behavior or who receives a deferred adjudication based on
  commission of any act that may constitute unlawful sexual
  behavior; except that, with respect to section 16-22-113 (1)(a)
  to (1)(e), a person who is adjudicated or receives a disposition
  as a juvenile may petition the court for an order to discontinue
  the duty to register as provided in those subsections, but only
  if the person has not subsequently been convicted as an adult of
  any offense involving unlawful sexual behavior or convicted as an
  adult of another offense, the underlying factual basis of which
  involves unlawful sexual behavior. In addition, the duty to
  provide notice to a person of the duty to register, as set forth
  in sections 16-22-105 to 16-22-107, applies to juvenile parole
  and probation officers and appropriate personnel of the division
  of youth services in the department of human services. If a
  person is required to register pursuant to this article 22 due to
  an adjudication or disposition as a juvenile, the duty to
  register automatically terminates either when the person reaches
  twenty-five years of age or seven years from the date the
  juvenile was required to register, whichever occurs
  later.</M></P>
  <P N="(5)(a)">(5)
  <N></N>(a)
  <M>Notwithstanding any provision of this article 22 to the
  contrary, if, pursuant to a motion filed by a person described in
  this subsection (5) or on its own motion, a court determines that
  exempting the person from the registration requirement would not
  pose a significant risk to the community, the court, upon
  consideration of the totality of the circumstances, may exempt
  the person from the registration requirements imposed pursuant to
  this section if:</M></P>
  <P N="(5)(a)(I)">(I)
  <M>The person was younger than eighteen years of age at the time
  of the commission of the offense; and</M></P>
  <P N="(5)(a)(II)">(II)
  <M>The person has not been previously adjudicated or received a
  disposition for a separate offense involving unlawful sexual
  behavior; and</M></P>
  <P N="(5)(a)(III)">(III)
  <M>The person was adjudicated or received a disposition for any
  offense of unlawful sexual behavior or another offense, the
  underlying factual basis of which involved unlawful sexual
  behavior; and</M></P>
  <P N="(5)(a)(IV)">(IV)
  <M>The person has received an evaluation that conforms with the
  standards developed pursuant to section 16-11.7-103 (4)(i) from
  an evaluator who meets the standards established by the sex
  offender management board, and the evaluator recommends exempting
  the person from the registration requirements based upon the best
  interests of that person and the community; and</M></P>
  <P N="(5)(a)(IV.5)">(IV.5)
  <M>The court has considered a written or oral statement by the
  victim of the offense for which the juvenile would otherwise be
  required to register, if provided by the victim, on the question
  of whether the juvenile should be exempted from the statutory
  duty to register as a sex offender; and</M></P>
  <P N="(5)(a)(V)">(V)
  <M>The court makes written findings of fact specifying the
  grounds for granting such exemption.</M></P>
  <P N="(5)(b)">(b)
  <M>Any defendant who files a motion pursuant to this subsection
  (5) or the court, if considering its own motion, shall provide
  notice of the motion to the prosecuting district attorney. In
  addition, the court shall provide notice of the motion to the
  victim of the offense. Prior to deciding the motion, the court
  shall conduct a hearing on the motion at which both the district
  attorney and the victim shall have opportunity to be
  heard.</M></P>
  <P N="(6)">(6)
  <M>Any person who is required to register pursuant to this
  section and fails to do so or otherwise fails to comply with the
  provisions of this article may be subject to prosecution for the
  offense of failure to register as a sex offender, as described in
  section 18-3-412.5, C.R.S. Failure of any governmental entity or
  any employee of any governmental entity to comply with any
  requirement of this article shall not constitute a defense to the
  offense of failure to register as a sex offender if there is
  evidence that the defendant had actual notice of the duty to
  register.</M></P></SECTION-TEXT>

    <B>Annotator's note.</B>Since § 16-22-103 is similar to §

    reenactment, relevant cases construing that provision have been
    included in the annotations to this section. 
    <P>
    <B>Prior to the 2004 amendment, subsection (1)(c)</B>referred
    to the department of corrections in Colorado not that of any
    other state. Fendley v. People, 107 P.3d 1122 (Colo. App.
    2004).</P>
    <P>
    <B>Use of present tense in subsection (3) refers to any person
    currently required to register</B>in the state of conviction of
    the sexual offense and not to a person who "was" or "has been"
    required to register. Fendley v. People, 107 P.3d 1122 (Colo.
    App. 2004).</P>
    <P>
    <B>Although application of subsection (1) relates back to
    convicted sexual offenders released on or after July 1, 1991,
    it does not violate the prohibition against ex post facto laws,
    because the statute does not disadvantage the offender.</B>The
    registration requirement is intended to assist law enforcement
    officials in investigating future sex crimes and to protect the
    public safety. As such, it is remedial, not punitive, and does
    not unconstitutionally enhance the offender's punishment.
    Jamison v. People, 988 P.2d 177 (Colo. App. 1999); People v.
    Sowell, 327 P.3d 273 (Colo. App. 2011).</P>
    <P>
    <B>The 2008 amendments to subsection (2)(d)(I) were substantive
    and cannot be applied retroactively.</B>A retroactive
    application would modify vested rights and liabilities. Vondra
    v. Colo. Dept. of Corr., 226 P.3d 1165 (Colo. App. 2009).</P>
    <P>
    <B>Procedural due process does not entitle a sex offender to a
    hearing on the sex offender's dangerousness before requiring
    the sex offender to register.</B>Due process does not guarantee
    the right to a hearing to establish a fact that is not material
    under the statute. Dangerousness is not material under the
    registration statute, the duty to register is triggered by a
    conviction of a sex offense. The statute even states the crime
    for which the registrant was convicted may not reflect the
    current level of dangerousness. People ex rel. C.B.B., 75 P.3d
    1148 (Colo. App. 2003).</P>
    <P>
    <B>Procedural due process does not entitle a juvenile sex
    offender to present evidence or to be heard regarding his or
    her potential for rehabilitation.</B>Defendant's potential for
    rehabilitation is irrelevant to the sex offender registration
    requirement; defendant was required to register as a sex

    substantive due process claim that registration deprives
    juveniles of their liberty interests in living, associating
    with families and friends, and circulating in society does not
    implicate a fundamental right and the act's stated purpose of
    protecting the public is rational. Juvenile defendant's privacy
    rights are not violated because juveniles do not necessarily
    have greater privacy rights than adults and internet posting

    one who has been twice adjudicated for offenses involving
    unlawful sexual behavior, to register as a sex offender for
    life without regard for whether he or she poses a risk to
    public safety is an overly inclusive -- and therefore excessive
    -- means of protecting public safety. Because the lifetime
    registration requirement is not adequately tethered to the
    statute's stated nonpunitive purpose, the automatic lifetime
    registration requirement for juvenile offenders is excessive.
    And because the lifetime registration requirement is excessive
    in relation to its nonpunitive purpose when applied to
    juveniles, it operates more like a punishment. People in

    offender in this state.</B>Defendant is a person "required to
    register in the state of conviction" and a person who would be
    "required to register if convicted in this state". The civil
    commitment proceedings in the other state were equivalent to a
    deferred judgment and sentencing in this state, thus satisfying
    the "convicted" requirement of the statute. The other state's
    commitment procedures included sufficient due process
    protections. The crime that was the subject of the civil
    commitment would essentially have been sexual assault on a
    child in this state. Mayo v. People, 181 P.3d 1207 (Colo. App.

    <B>A person with an out-of-state conviction for an offense

    <P>
    <B>Defendant not required to register as a sex offender for
    offense committed in another state if</B>all of the Colorado
    elements of the crime are not met. Because statute included one
    element that the other state's statute did not, the prosecution
    did not satisfy all of the elements of the crime of indecent
    exposure, thus defendant was not required to register as a sex
    offender for a conviction of indecent exposure in another

    <P>

    victim to unwanted sexual contact through threats,
    intimidation, and physical force. Vondra v. Colo. Dept. of
    Corr., 226 P.3d 1165 (Colo. App. 2009).</P>
    <P>
    <B>Evidence sufficient to establish jury's finding that

    that he knew he had to register when he established a new

    under a state sex offender registration statute does not
    satisfy § 2254's condition that a petitioner be "in custody" at
    the time petitioner files a habeas petition. Registration
    requirements are collateral consequences of conviction that do
    not impose a severe restriction on an individual's freedom.

  <M>Each person who is required to register pursuant to section
  16-22-103 shall register with the local law enforcement agency in
  each jurisdiction in which the person resides. A local law
  enforcement agency shall accept the registration of a person who
  lacks a fixed residence; except that the law enforcement agency
  is not required to accept the person's registration if it
  includes a residence or location that would violate state law or
  local ordinance. If the residence or location with which the
  person attempts to register constitutes such a violation, the law
  enforcement agency shall so advise the person and give the person
  an opportunity to secure an alternate location within five
  days.</M>
  <P N="(1)(a)(II)">(II)
  <M>Each person who is required to register pursuant to section
  16-22-103 shall initially register or, if sentenced on or after
  January 1, 2005, confirm his or her initial registration within
  five business days after release from incarceration for
  commission of the offense requiring registration or within five
  business days after receiving notice of the duty to register, if
  the person was not incarcerated. The person shall register with
  the local law enforcement agency during business hours by
  completing a standardized registration form provided to the
  person by the local law enforcement agency and paying the
  registration fee imposed by the local law enforcement agency as
  provided in subsection (7) of this section. After the initial
  registration, the local law enforcement agency may waive the
  requirement that the person reregister in person if the
  registrant suffers from a chronic physical or intellectual
  disability that substantially limits the person's ability to
  function independently and participate in major life activities
  to the extent that it is a severe hardship to reregister in
  person and there is a medical record of such disability. If the
  law enforcement agency waives the requirement to reregister in
  person, the law enforcement agency shall reregister the person
  after verifying the person's current address with the person and
  at least one other reliable source which may include: His or her
  caregiver, his or her family, the facility where the person
  resides, or another source of verification satisfactory to the
  law enforcement agency. The law enforcement agency shall provide
  verification of the waiver, by the submission of a form developed
  by the CBI, to the CBI and any other law enforcement agency with
  which the registrant is required to register. If the law
  enforcement agency issues such a waiver, every three years the
  agency must determine whether the registrant still meets the
  waiver requirements and reauthorize the waiver. If the law
  enforcement agency issues a waiver or reauthorizes the waiver,
  the law enforcement agency shall also notify the victim of the
  offense for which the petitioner is required to register, if the
  victim of the offense has requested notice and provided contact
  information. The CBI shall provide standardized registration
  forms to the local law enforcement agencies pursuant to section
  16-22-109.</M></P>

  registration and annually within five business days before or
  after the person's birthday thereafter. Such person shall
  reregister pursuant to this paragraph (b) with the local law
  enforcement agency of each jurisdiction in which the person
  resides within five business days before or after his or her
  birthday, in the manner provided in paragraph (a) of this
  subsection (1).</M></P>

  Colorado, register with the local law enforcement agency of the
  jurisdiction in which he or she establishes the additional
  residence. The person shall register in said jurisdiction in the
  manner provided in paragraph (a) of this subsection (1) and shall
  reregister as provided in paragraph (b) of this subsection (1) or
  paragraph (d) of this subsection (1), whichever is applicable, in
  said jurisdiction so long as the person resides in said

  months after the date on which the person was released from
  incarceration for commission of the offense requiring

    <B>Given the important governmental interest in protecting
    public safety, any incidental limitations on an offender's
    first amendment rights are justified.</B>The fact that offender
    may have been terminated from social-media-related websites
    because he is on the sex offender registry does not indicate
    that subsection (2.5)(a) is vague, but arises from the
    dissemination of accurate information about a criminal record,
    most of which is already public. Melnick v. Camper, 487 F.
    Supp. 3d 1039 (D. Colo. 2020). 
    <P>
    <B>Requiring an offender to disclose online identities is not a
    fourth amendment violation</B>because an offender has no
    reasonable expectation of privacy in those identities, as they
    are known by the third-party internet providers to whom the
    offender transmits the information. Melnick v. Camper, 487 F.
    Supp. 3d 1039 (D. Colo. 2020).</P>
    <P>Any searches or seizures required by SORA serve special
    needs -- such as the protection of potential future victims and
    the solving of crimes in the future -- and purport neither to
    facilitate the investigation of any specific crime nor
    primarily to serve a general interest in crime control.
    Moreover, the degree of intrusion on convicted sex offenders is
    reasonable in relation to the interests advanced by SORA.
    Melnick v. Camper, 487 F. Supp. 3d 1039 (D. Colo. 2020).</P>
    <P>A parolee does not enjoy the absolute liberty to which every
    citizen is entitled, but only conditional liberty properly
    dependent on observance of special parole restrictions. The
    purpose of these restrictions is to assist with offenders'
    rehabilitation while protecting the safety of the community.
    These goals justify certain limitations on a parolee's fourth
    amendment rights and expectations of privacy. Melnick v.
    Camper, 487 F. Supp. 3d 1039 (D. Colo. 2020).</P>
    <P>
    <B>Residency of sex offenders.</B>A municipal ordinance that
    effectively bans all felony and many misdemeanor sex offenders
    from living within its boundaries, but draws no distinctions
    based upon the nature of the offense, the treatment the
    offender has received, the risk that he or she will reoffend
    against children, and the evaluation and recommendations of
    qualified state officials, is preempted by state law. Ryals v.
    City of Englewood, 962 F. Supp. 2d 1236 (D. Colo. 2013). But
    see Ryals v. City of Englewood, 2016 CO 8, 364 P.3d 900.</P>
    <P>City ordinance that effectively bars certain sex offenders
    from residing within the city is not preempted by state law.
    Ryals v. City of Englewood, 2016 CO 8, 364 P.3d 900.</P>
    <P>The regulation of sex offender residency is, under the
    present pattern of state laws, a matter of mixed state and
    local concern. Ryals v. City of Englewood, 962 F. Supp. 2d 1236
    (D. Colo. 2013); Ryals v. City of Englewood, 2016 CO 8, 364
    P.3d 900.</P>
    <P>The operational effect of the municipal ordinance
    impermissibly conflicts with the application and effectuation
    of the state interest in the uniform treatment, management,
    rehabilitation, and reintegration of sex offenders during and
    after state supervision. The ordinance not only undermines the
    underlying policy interests that envelop the existing state
    regulations, but it also operationally forbids what the state
    scheme allows. Ryals v. City of Englewood, 962 F. Supp. 2d 1236
    (D. Colo. 2013). But see Ryals v. City of Englewood, 2016 CO 8,
    364 P.3d 900, annotated above.</P>
    <P>
    <B>Eviction, homelessness, or lack of a fixed residence do not
    negate requirement to register within five days of release into
    community.</B>The requirement for initial registration as a sex
    offender is based on number of days following release into the
    community and is not tied to where an individual is living or
    whether that location changed during the five-day period.
    People v. Wilson, 2017 COA 89, 488 P.3d 1.</P>
    <P>
    <B>Defendant charged under former version of registration
    statute is properly registered if he or she registers either on
    his or her birthday or the first business day
    thereafter.</B>Court may not infer the intent of the general
    assembly by review of a subsequent amendment to the statute,
    and plain meaning of prior statute allowed for registration on
    either day. People v. Duncan, 109 P.3d 1044 (Colo. App. 2004)
    (decided under former § 18-3-412.5 (3)(a)(I)).</P>
    <P>
    <B>Subsection (2.5)(a) requires only child sex offenders to
    disclose online identities.</B>Melnick v. Camper, 487 F. Supp.
    3d 1039 (D. Colo. 2020).</P>
    <P>
    <B>A violation of subsection (3)(i) of this section must be
    charged under the catchall provision of § 18-3-412.5 (1), and
    not under § 18-3-412.5 (1)(g).</B>If, in 2012, the general
    assembly had intended to broaden the meaning of § 18-3-412.5
    (1)(g), it could have amended that provision to explicitly
    include the situation of a sex offender who lacks a fixed
    residence. People v. Jones, 2017 COA 116, 405 P.3d

    <B>The intent of the Colorado Sex Offender Registration Act
    (SORA) registration requirements is nonpunitive.</B>Millard v.
    Rankin, 265 F. Supp. 3d 1211 (D. Colo. 2017), aff'd sub nom.
    Millard v. Camper, 971 F.3d 1174 (10th Cir. 2020); Melnick v.
    Camper, 487 F. Supp. 3d 1039 (D. Colo. 2020). 
    <P>
    <B>The effects of SORA as applied to registered sex offenders
    do not constitute punishment under the eighth
    amendment.</B>First, SORA does not resemble public shaming.
    Second, SORA does not resemble banishment. Finally, the
    application of SORA to the offenders does not amount to
    probation. Millard v. Camper, 971 F.3d 1174 (10th Cir. 2020);
    Melnick v. Camper, 487 F. Supp. 3d 1039 (D. Colo. 2020).</P>
    <P>
    <B>SORA does not promote the traditional aims of
    punishment.</B>Deterrent purpose alone is not enough to render
    a regulatory scheme criminal in nature. Tying the length of the
    reporting requirement to the nature of the offense, rather than
    individual risk, does not render the registration obligation
    retributive. Millard v. Camper, 971 F.3d 1174 (10th Cir.
    2020).</P>
    <P>
    <B>SORA is rationally connected to the state's avowed
    regulatory purpose of public safety.</B>Its requirements are
    keyed to the seriousness of the underlying sex-offense
    conviction, and are thus consistent with the regulatory
    objective of protecting public safety. Millard v. Camper, 971
    F.3d 1174 (10th Cir. 2020).</P>
    <P>
    <B>SORA is not excessive in relation to its nonpunitive
    purpose.</B>Millard v. Camper, 971 F.3d 1174 (10th Cir.
    2020).</P>
    <P>
    <B>SORA does not violate substantive due process.</B>There is a
    rational connection between it and the government's interest in
    public safety. The touchstone of due process is protection of
    the individual against arbitrary action of government, not the
    public. Millard v. Camper, 971 F.3d 1174 (10th Cir. 2020).</P>
    <P>Unless registered sex offenders challenging its
    constitutionality connect SORA's alleged irrebuttable
    presumption of re-offense to a recognized fundamental
    constitutional right or explain why the presumption would be
    unconstitutional, the presumption does not offend substantive
    due process. Millard v. Camper, 971 F.3d 1174 (10th Cir.
    2020).</P>
    <P>
    <B>The procedural protections attendant to a conviction for a
    criminal sex offense are sufficient to protect an offender's
    right to due process</B>before being placed on a sex offender
    registry. Melnick v. Camper, 487 F. Supp. 3d 1039 (D. Colo.
    2020).</P>
    <P>
    <B>The requirement for mandatory lifetime registration on the
    sex offender registry for twice-adjudicated juveniles, without
    the opportunity for individual assessment or the ability to
    deregister upon demonstrating rehabilitation, constitutes cruel
    and unusual punishment in violation of the eighth
    amendment.</B>People in Interest of T.B., 2021 CO 59, 489 P.3d
    752.</P>
    <P>Analyzing any statute under the eighth amendment involves a
    two-part inquiry: (1) Is the registration requirement a
    "punishment", and, if so, (2) is it "cruel and unusual"? People
    in Interest of T.B., 2019 COA 89, 490 P.3d 455, aff'd in part
    and rev'd in part on other grounds, 2021 CO 59, 489 P.3d
    752.</P>
    <P>With regard to the first inquiry, requiring a juvenile, even
    one who has been twice adjudicated for offenses involving
    unlawful sexual behavior, to register as a sex offender for
    life without regard for whether he or she poses a risk to
    public safety is an overly inclusive -- and therefore excessive
    -- means of protecting public safety. Because the lifetime
    registration requirement is not adequately tethered to the
    statute's stated nonpunitive purpose, the automatic lifetime
    registration requirement for juvenile offenders is excessive.
    And because the lifetime registration requirement is excessive
    in relation to its nonpunitive purpose when applied to
    juveniles, it operates more like a punishment. People in
    Interest of T.B., 2019 COA 89, 490 P.3d 455, aff'd in part and
    rev'd in part on other grounds, 2021 CO 59, 489 P.3d 752.</P>
    <P>
    <B>SORA's forced signed statement requirement and being
    compelled to provide information under threat of a crime do not
    violate the fifth amendment.</B>The required information does
    not implicate a substantial risk of self-incrimination. The
    registration requirement does not subject the offender to any
    additional criminal exposure or liability. Rather, it requires
    only an acknowledgment that the offender has been previously
    adjudicated or convicted of a crime. Melnick v. Camper, 487 F.
    Supp. 3d 1039 (D. Colo. 2020).</P>
    <P>
    <B>SORA does not violate the ex post facto clause.</B>The
    general assembly did not intend SORA to be punitive or anything
    other than a civil proceeding. SORA's effects are not punitive
    enough to negate the legislature's civil intent. Melnick v.
    Camper, 487 F. Supp. 3d 1039 (D. Colo. 2020).</P>
    <P>
    <B>Residency of sex offenders.</B>A municipal ordinance that
    effectively bans all felony and many misdemeanor sex offenders
    from living within its boundaries, but draws no distinctions
    based upon the nature of the offense, the treatment the
    offender has received, the risk that he or she will reoffend
    against children, and the evaluation and recommendations of
    qualified state officials, is preempted by state law. Ryals v.
    City of Englewood, 962 F. Supp. 2d 1236 (D. Colo. 2013). But
    see Ryals v. City of Englewood, 2016 CO 8, 364 P.3d 900.</P>
    <P>City ordinance that effectively bars certain sex offenders
    from residing within the city is not preempted by state law.
    Ryals v. City of Englewood, 2016 CO 8, 364 P.3d 900.</P>
    <P>The regulation of sex offender residency is, under the
    present pattern of state laws, a matter of mixed state and
    local concern. Ryals v. City of Englewood, 962 F. Supp. 2d 1236
    (D. Colo. 2013); Ryals v. City of Englewood, 2016 CO 8, 364
    P.3d 900.</P>
    <P>The operational effect of the municipal ordinance
    impermissibly conflicts with the application and effectuation
    of the state interest in the uniform treatment, management,
    rehabilitation, and reintegration of sex offenders during and
    after state supervision. The ordinance not only undermines the
    underlying policy interests that envelop the existing state
    regulations, but it also operationally forbids what the state
    scheme allows. Ryals v. City of Englewood, 962 F. Supp. 2d 1236
    (D. Colo. 2013). But see Ryals v. City of Englewood, 2016 CO 8,

    <B>The intent of the Colorado Sex Offender Registration Act
    (SORA) registration requirements is nonpunitive.</B>Millard v.
    Rankin, 265 F. Supp. 3d 1211 (D. Colo. 2017), aff'd sub nom.
    Millard v. Camper, 971 F.3d 1174 (10th Cir. 2020); Melnick v.
    Camper, 487 F. Supp. 3d 1039 (D. Colo. 2020). 
    <P>
    <B>The effects of SORA as applied to registered sex offenders
    do not constitute punishment under the eighth
    amendment.</B>First, SORA does not resemble public shaming.
    Second, SORA does not resemble banishment. Finally, the
    application of SORA to the offenders does not amount to
    probation. Millard v. Camper, 971 F.3d 1174 (10th Cir. 2020);
    Melnick v. Camper, 487 F. Supp. 3d 1039 (D. Colo. 2020).</P>
    <P>
    <B>SORA does not promote the traditional aims of
    punishment.</B>Deterrent purpose alone is not enough to render
    a regulatory scheme criminal in nature. Tying the length of the
    reporting requirement to the nature of the offense, rather than
    individual risk, does not render the registration obligation
    retributive. Millard v. Camper, 971 F.3d 1174 (10th Cir.
    2020).</P>
    <P>
    <B>SORA is rationally connected to the state's avowed
    regulatory purpose of public safety.</B>Its requirements are
    keyed to the seriousness of the underlying sex-offense
    conviction, and are thus consistent with the regulatory
    objective of protecting public safety. Millard v. Camper, 971
    F.3d 1174 (10th Cir. 2020).</P>
    <P>
    <B>SORA is not excessive in relation to its nonpunitive
    purpose.</B>Millard v. Camper, 971 F.3d 1174 (10th Cir.
    2020).</P>
    <P>
    <B>SORA does not violate substantive due process.</B>There is a
    rational connection between it and the government's interest in
    public safety. The touchstone of due process is protection of
    the individual against arbitrary action of government, not the
    public. Millard v. Camper, 971 F.3d 1174 (10th Cir. 2020);
    Melnick v. Camper, 487 F. Supp. 3d 1039 (D. Colo. 2020).</P>
    <P>Unless registered sex offenders challenging its
    constitutionality connect SORA's alleged irrebuttable
    presumption of re-offense to a recognized fundamental
    constitutional right or explain why the presumption would be
    unconstitutional, the presumption does not offend substantive
    due process. Millard v. Camper, 971 F.3d 1174 (10th Cir.
    2020).</P>
    <P>
    <B>The requirement for mandatory lifetime registration on the
    sex offender registry for twice-adjudicated juveniles, without
    the opportunity for individual assessment or the ability to
    deregister upon demonstrating rehabilitation, constitutes cruel
    and unusual punishment in violation of the eighth
    amendment.</B>People in Interest of T.B., 2021 CO 59, 489 P.3d
    752.</P>
    <P>Analyzing any statute under the eighth amendment involves a
    two-part inquiry: (1) Is the registration requirement a
    "punishment", and, if so, (2) is it "cruel and unusual"? People
    in Interest of T.B., 2019 COA 89, 490 P.3d 455, aff'd in part
    and rev'd in part on other grounds, 2021 CO 59, 489 P.3d
    752.</P>
    <P>With regard to the first inquiry, requiring a juvenile, even
    one who has been twice adjudicated for offenses involving
    unlawful sexual behavior, to register as a sex offender for
    life without regard for whether he or she poses a risk to
    public safety is an overly inclusive -- and therefore excessive
    -- means of protecting public safety. Because the lifetime
    registration requirement is not adequately tethered to the
    statute's stated nonpunitive purpose, the automatic lifetime
    registration requirement for juvenile offenders is excessive.
    And because the lifetime registration requirement is excessive
    in relation to its nonpunitive purpose when applied to
    juveniles, it operates more like a punishment. People in
    Interest of T.B., 2019 COA 89, 490 P.3d 455, aff'd in part and
    rev'd in part on other grounds, 2021 CO 59, 489 P.3d 752.</P>
    <P>
    <B>SORA does not impact registered sex offender's free speech
    under the first amendment because it does not prohibit him from
    visiting social-media-related websites or communicating with
    his family.</B>Melnick v. Camper, 487 F. Supp. 3d 1039 (D.
    Colo. 2020).</P>
    <P>
    <B>Nor does SORA impact the offender's free speech when social
    media related websites terminated him from the sites.</B>SORA
    does not prohibit an offender from visiting
    social-media-related websites. And to the extent the offender
    asserts limitations on internet use because of the requirement
    that e-mail addresses, instant-messaging identities, or
    chatroom identities be registered, that requirement does not
    apply to him because he was not convicted of a child sex crime.
    Melnick v. Camper, 487 F. Supp. 3d 1039 (D. Colo. 2020).</P>
    <P>To the extent that social-media-related websites terminated
    registered sex offender's ability to access their sites, such
    decisions by private actors are not covered by the first
    amendment. Melnick v. Camper, 487 F. Supp. 3d 1039 (D. Colo.
    2020).</P>
    <P>
    <B>SORA does not violate offender's right to familial
    association.</B>The fact that he alleges that he cannot use
    social-media-related websites does not prevent him from
    communicating with his family in other ways, including the
    traditional methods of telephone calls, mail, e-mail, or
    visits. Melnick v. Camper, 487 F. Supp. 3d 1039 (D. Colo.

    <B>The requirement for mandatory lifetime registration on the
    sex offender registry for twice-adjudicated juveniles, without
    the opportunity for individual assessment or the ability to
    deregister upon demonstrating rehabilitation, constitutes cruel
    and unusual punishment in violation of the eighth
    amendment.</B>People in Interest of T.B., 2021 CO 59, 489 P.3d
    752. 
    <P>Analyzing any statute under the eighth amendment involves a
    two-part inquiry: (1) Is the registration requirement a
    "punishment", and, if so, (2) is it "cruel and unusual"? People
    in Interest of T.B., 2019 COA 89, 490 P.3d 455, aff'd in part
    and rev'd in part on other grounds, 2021 CO 59, 489 P.3d
    752.</P>
    <P>With regard to the first inquiry, requiring a juvenile, even
    one who has been twice adjudicated for offenses involving
    unlawful sexual behavior, to register as a sex offender for
    life without regard for whether he or she poses a risk to
    public safety is an overly inclusive -- and therefore excessive
    -- means of protecting public safety. Because the lifetime
    registration requirement is not adequately tethered to the
    statute's stated nonpunitive purpose, the automatic lifetime
    registration requirement for juvenile offenders is excessive.
    And because the lifetime registration requirement is excessive
    in relation to its nonpunitive purpose when applied to
    juveniles, it operates more like a punishment. People in
    Interest of T.B., 2019 COA 89, 490 P.3d 455, aff'd in part and
    rev'd in part on other grounds, 2021 CO 59, 489 P.3d 752.</P>
    <P>
    <B>The reference to "successful completion of and discharge
    from a juvenile sentence or disposition" does not mean</B>that
    the person must have successfully completed the person's
    original sentence or disposition. People in Interest of J.M.M.,
    2021 COA 88, 496 P.3d 833.</P>
    <P>
    <B>Individual who successfully completes a deferred judgment
    and sentence for sexual assault on a child is eligible to
    petition the court for removal from the sex offender
    registry.</B>People v. Perry, 252 P.3d 45 (Colo. App.
    2010).</P>
    <P>
    <B>A "conviction" for purposes of the bar in subsection (3)(c)
    does not include a successfully completed deferred
    judgment.</B>McCulley v. People, 2020 CO 40, 463 P.3d 254.</P>
    <P>
    <B>Conviction on more than one charge of unlawful sexual
    behavior,</B>whether adjudicated in the same case or in
    separate cases, renders defendant ineligible for relief from
    status as a sex offender and for removal from sex offender
    registry. Statute contains no explicit limiting language that
    would require "multiple convictions" to be the result of more
    than one proceeding. People v. Atencio, 219 P.3d 1080 (Colo.
    App. 2009).</P>
    <P>
    <B>A person with an out-of-state conviction for an offense
    comparable to sexual assault on a child in this state is not
    eligible to discontinue registration with this state's sex
    offender registry</B>because a person who is convicted in this
    state of the same offense is not eligible to discontinue
    registration. Curtiss v. People, 2014 COA 107, 410 P.3d
    539.</P>
    <P>
    <B>A person convicted of an offense outside this state that is
    comparable to the offenses listed in subsection (3) is not
    eligible to petition for discontinuation of sex offender
    registration.</B>Because defendant was convicted in another
    state of an offense comparable to § 18-3-402 (1)(e), he is not
    eligible to discontinue his registration requirement. Stanley
    v. Dist. Attorney, 2017 COA 33, 395 P.3d 1198.</P>
    <P>
    <B>The language "or to the comparable requirements of any other
    jurisdictions in which they may reside" in subsection (3) does
    not allow</B>a person required to register here as a sex
    offender because of an out-of-state conviction to discontinue
    registration if the person is no longer required to register in
    the state of the conviction. Stanley v. Dist. Attorney, 2017
    COA 33, 395 P.3d 1198.</P>
    <P>
    <B>No exception to 10-year waiting period in subsection
    (1)(b).</B>The fact that the court made sex offender
    registration part of defendant's probation sentence does not
    change the fact that defendant was also statutorily required to
    register as a sex offender and thus is subject to the statutory
    waiting period before seeking to discontinue his registration
    duties. People v. Sheth, 2013 COA 33, 318 P.3d
