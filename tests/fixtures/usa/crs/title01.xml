    <ANNO-TEXT>
    <B>Annotator's note.</B>The following annotations include cases
    decided under former provisions similar to this section. 
    <P>
    <B>Distinction made between "political party" and "political
    organization".</B>In common use the phrase "political party" is
    synonymous with "political organization", but the general
    assembly by this section has made a marked distinction between
    them. Clements v. People ex rel. Lee, 58 Colo. 105, 143 P. 834
    (1914).</P>
    <P>
    <B>"Political organization" defined.</B>An association of
    qualified electors who, by petition, place upon an official
    ballot individual nominees for public office constitute a
    "political organization". Clements v. People ex rel. Lee, 58
    Colo. 105, 143 P. 834 (1914).</P>
    <P>
    <B>As a condition precedent for such a "political organization"
    to become a "political party"</B>within the statutory
    definition, it shall participate in an election, and, in
    addition thereto, cast for its candidate for governor at least
    ten percent of the total vote cast at such election. When these
    things occur, the "political organization" becomes a "political
    party". Clements v. People ex rel. Lee, 58 Colo. 105, 143 P.
    834 (1914).</P>
    <P>
    <B>If a person is the candidate solely of one "political party"
    or a single "political organization",</B>the votes which he
    receives at a given election are conclusively presumed to have
    been cast by the particular party or organization whose
    candidate he is. Clements v. People ex rel. Lee, 58 Colo. 105,
    143 P. 834 (1914).</P>
    <P>
    <B>But if a person is the candidate of two or more "political
    parties" or "political organizations",</B>no such presumption
    can exist. Clements v. People ex rel. Lee, 58 Colo. 105, 143 P.
    834 (1914).</P>
    <P>
    <B>Thus, where distinct political organizations, under
    different names, present the same individual as their
    candidate</B>for governor, the votes cast by all these several
    organizations for the same candidate are not to be considered
    as cast by any one "party", as such is not conditioned upon the
    number of votes which the candidate received, but upon the
    number an organization itself cast. Clements v. People ex rel.
    Lee, 58 Colo. 105, 143 P. 834 (1914).</P>
    <P>
    <B>For a political organization is a distinct entity</B>which
    can neither coalesce with another, nor lose its identity
    therein by the mere fact that its candidates, principles, and
    management are the same. Clements v. People ex rel. Lee, 58
    Colo. 105, 143 P. 834 (1914).</P>
    <P>
    <B>Evidence that organizations voting for same person were but
    one organization under different names held
    inadmissible.</B>Clements v. People ex rel. Lee, 58 Colo. 105,
    143 P. 834 (1914).</P></ANNO-TEXT>
    <AN-DIV>II. TAXPAYING ELECTOR.</AN-DIV>
    <ANNO-TEXT>
    <B>The phrases "taxpaying elector" and "qualified taxpaying
    elector" describe situations in which payment of a property tax
    is an additional qualification</B>for voting. Sheldon v. Moffat
    Tunnel Comm'n, 335 F. Supp. 251 (D. Colo. 1971). 
    <P>
    <B>However, these phrases are not used in connection with
    general elections.</B>Sheldon v. Moffat Tunnel Comm'n, 335 F.
    Supp. 251 (D. Colo. 1971).</P>
    <P>
    <B>Only taxpaying electors entitled to vote on municipal bond
    issue.</B>In an election on a municipal bond issue, it is clear
    that under this subsection only those electors who paid, or
    were obligated to pay, taxes on real or personal property
    subject to the mill levy of the municipality are eligible to
    vote. City of Montrose v. Niles, 124 Colo. 535, 238 P.2d 875
    (1951).</P>
    <P>
    <B>And in such a case, the tax on real or personal property
    unquestionably means</B>a tax on property which is subject to
    the mill levy of the city. City of Montrose v. Niles, 124 Colo.
    535, 238 P.2d 875 (1951).</P>
    <P>
    <B>Hence, county taxpayers cannot vote in municipal
    elections.</B>Registered electors of the city who paid taxes in
    the county, but who did not pay taxes on property in the city,
    do not have the right to vote on the question of the erection
    of a municipal electric light plant. City of Loveland v. W.
    Light &amp; Power Co., 65 Colo. 55, 173 P. 717 (1918).</P>
    <P>
    <B>Moreover, a person who owns property which is assessed in
    the name of another is not a "taxpaying elector"</B>qualified
    to vote in a municipal bond election. City of Montrose v.
    Niles, 124 Colo. 535, 238 P.2d 875 (1951).</P>
    <P>
    <B>Nor is a purchaser of realty under contract of sale.</B>City
    of Montrose v. Niles, 124 Colo. 535, 238 P.2d 875 (1951).</P>
    <P>
    <B>As ownership of property in and of itself is insufficient to
    qualify</B>a citizen to vote, the property owned must in fact
    be "assessed to" him upon the assessment rolls of the county.
    City of Montrose v. Niles, 124 Colo. 535, 238 P.2d 875
    (1951).</P>
    <P>
    <B>"Taxpaying elector" also must be registered.</B>In a
    municipal bond election a person who possesses all
    qualifications as to ownership and assessment of property is
    nevertheless not entitled to vote over the objection that he is
    not registered. City of Montrose v. Niles, 124 Colo. 535, 238
    P.2d 875 (1951).</P></ANNO-TEXT>

    <B>Secretary of state's power to promulgate rules regarding
    elections is not without limits.</B>Under this section, the
    secretary of state has the authority to promulgate rules
    necessary to ensure the proper administration of elections. But
    the secretary lacks authority to promulgate rules that conflict
    with statutory provisions. Hanlen v. Gessler, 2014 CO 24, 333

    <P>
    <B>Adoption of 8 Colo. Code Regs. 1505-1, § 10.7.5, of the
    secretary of state's rules regarding the treatment of votes
    cast for ineligible candidates exceeded the secretary's
    rulemaking authority.</B>As a rule of general applicability,
    the rule specifically contravenes § 1-4-1002. The rule also
    contravenes the election code by permitting a designated
    election official to usurp the courts' express authority to
    determine issues regarding a candidate's eligibility that arise
    following certification to the ballot. The rule thus conflicts
    with the election code and is therefore void. Hanlen v.

    <ANNO-TEXT>
    <B>Annotator's note.</B>The following annotations include cases
    decided under former provisions similar to this section. 
    <P>
    <B>Authority of courts to determine election controversies when
    no candidate declared duly elected.</B>State constitutional
    provisions and statutes permitting general assembly to judge
    election of members does not limit subject matter jurisdiction
    of district court to hear controversies related to elections
    where no candidate is yet declared duly elected by secretary of
    state. Meyer v. Lamm, 846 P.2d 862 (Colo. 1993) (decided under
    former § 1-1-112).</P>
    <P>
    <B>This section does not purport to impose any duty or function
    upon any election official, but rather provides a procedural
    vehicle for the adjudication of controversies arising from a
    breach or neglect of duty or other wrongful act that occurs
    prior to the day of an election.</B>More particularly, it
    requires the district court, upon a finding of good cause, to
    issue an order requiring substantial compliance with the
    provisions of the election code whenever any eligible elector
    files a verified petition alleging that a person charged with a
    duty under the code has committed a breach or neglect of that
    duty or other wrongful act. Carson v. Reiner, 2016 CO 38, 370
    P.3d 1137.</P>
    <P>
    <B>Conflict with § 1-4-501 (3).</B>Because this section permits
    the adjudication of controversies arising from any wrongful act
    that occurs prior to the day of an election, without further
    limitation, while § 1-4-501 (3) provides a specific challenge
    to the qualification of a candidate if made by filing a
    verified petition with the district court within five days of
    his or her certification to the ballot, the two provisions very
    much appear to be in conflict. Because effect can reasonably be
    given to both provisions and because this section is not the
    later adopted of the two, the legislative prescription for this
    conflict is to give effect to § 1-4-501 (3) as the special, or
    more specific, provision. Carson v. Reiner, 2016 CO 38, 370
    P.3d 1137.</P>
    <P>
    <B>This section stands in relation to § 1-4-501 (3) as a
    general to a special, or specific, provision.</B>Carson v.
    Reiner, 2016 CO 38, 370 P.3d 1137.</P>
    <P>
    <B>This section does not permit a challenge to an election
    official's certification of a candidate to the
    ballot,</B>solely on the basis of the certified candidate's
    qualification, once the § 1-4-501 (3) period for challenging
    the qualification of the candidate directly has expired. Carson
    v. Reiner, 2016 CO 38, 370 P.3d 1137.</P>
    <P>
    <B>Claims brought pursuant to this section are limited to those
    alleging a breach or neglect of duty or other wrongful act
    under the Uniform Election Code of 1992 (Code).</B>Thus, claims
    brought under 42 U.S.C. § 1983 cannot be brought in proceedings
    under this section. Where subsection (1) allows a claim to be
    brought against an election official who has allegedly
    committed a "breach or neglect of duty or other wrongful act"
    under "this code", it is referring to a breach of duty or other
    wrongful action under the Code, not a § 1983 claim. Colorado
    courts remain entirely open for the adjudication of § 1983
    claims, including on an expedited basis if a preliminary
    injunction is sought, and therefore § 1-1-113 does not run
    afoul of the supremacy clause. Frazier v. Williams, 2017 CO 85,
    401 P.3d 541 (overruling Brown v. Davidson, 192 P.3d 415 (Colo.
    App. 2006)); Williams v. Libertarian Party of Colo., 2017 CO
    86, 401 P.3d 558 (overruling Brown v. Davidson, 192 P.3d 415
    (Colo. App. 2006)).</P>
    <P>When a § 1983 claim is brought in a proceeding under this
    section, the district court should dismiss the claim without
    prejudice with leave to refile it in a separate action, which
    should then be assigned, where possible, to the same judge.
    Frazier v. Williams, 2017 CO 85, 401 P.3d 541 (overruling Brown
    v. Davidson, 192 P.3d 415 (Colo. App. 2006)).</P>
    <P>
    <B>A 42 U.S.C. § 1983 claim of deprivation of rights,
    privileges, or immunities secured by the federal constitution
    or federal law may be litigated under this section</B>if the
    claim arises out of a common nucleus of operative facts as the
    state law claims. Brown v. Davidson, 192 P.3d 415 (Colo. App.
    2006), overruled in Frazier v. Williams, 2017 CO 85, 401 P.3d
    541.</P>
    <P>
    <B>Colorado law permits the joinder of a 42 U.S.C. § 1983 claim
    with a claim under this section.</B>Brown v. Davidson, 192 P.3d
    415 (Colo. App. 2006), overruled in Frazier v. Williams, 2017
    CO 85, 401 P.3d 541.</P>
    <P>
    <B>Attorney fees should be awarded to a plaintiff pursuant to
    42 U.S.C. § 1988</B>if the plaintiff's victory on a
    nonconstitutional claim prevents the court from reaching a
    substantial constitutional claim that arises out of a common
    nucleus of operative facts. Brown v. Davidson, 192 P.3d 415
    (Colo. App. 2006), overruled on other grounds in Frazier v.
    Williams, 2017 CO 85, 401 P.3d 541.</P>
    <P>
    <B>Plaintiffs made a substantial constitutional claim,</B>which
    is a claim that is not wholly frivolous and does not conflict
    with any U.S. supreme court decisions, when they alleged that a
    state statute that requires unaffiliated candidates for the
    office of president and vice president of the United States to
    file candidate statements of intent nearly two months before
    statutory filing deadlines for affiliated candidates placed
    unequal burdens on unaffiliated candidates in violation of the
    first and fourteenth amendments to the U.S. constitution. Brown
    v. Davidson, 192 P.3d 415 (Colo. App. 2006), overruled on other
    grounds in Frazier v. Williams, 2017 CO 85, 401 P.3d
    541.</P></ANNO-TEXT>

    <B>The court is given jurisdiction</B>for the purpose of
    enforcing a substantial compliance with the provisions of
    election act by the parties to such controversy. People ex rel.
    McGaffey v. Dist. Court, 23 Colo. 150, 46 P. 681 (1896). 
    <P>
    <B>And provision for adjudication of controversies, being

    <P>
    <B>The district court has jurisdiction to order the recognition

    State Cent. Comm., 75 Colo. 312, 226 P. 656 (1924).</P>
    <P>
    <B>And it has jurisdiction to determine authority of the

    applies to the district court for relief, challenging the
    authority of the secretary to determine the controversy as well
    as the correctness of his decision upon the merits, the
    district court has jurisdiction to entertain the cause and
    determine the matter. People ex rel. McGaffey v. Dist. Court,
    23 Colo. 150, 46 P. 681 (1896).</P>
    <P>
    <B>The provision for adjudication of controversies contemplates

    <NL></NL>COURT OF APPEALS.</AN-DIV>
    <ANNO-TEXT>
    <B>The provision for adjudication of controversies does not
    confer original jurisdiction on the supreme court.</B>Leighton
    v. Bates, 24 Colo. 303, 50 P. 856, 50 P. 858 (1897). 
    <P>
    <B>Supreme court may in its discretion accept or reject an
    appeal</B>with respect to nominations of candidates, and if it
    elects to accept the appeal, it may proceed in a summary way to
    dispose of it. In re Weber, 186 Colo. 61, 525 P.2d 465
    (1974).</P>
    <P>
    <B>Court of appeals has jurisdiction to hear an appeal of a
    district court's denial of attorney fees under 42 U.S.C. §
    1988.</B>A judgment on the substantive merits of an action is
    separate from a judgment resolving a request for attorney fees.
    In addition, the § 1988 claim was not part of the summary
    proceedings pursuant to this section. The exceptions to the
    court of appeal's jurisdiction contained in this section and §
    13-4-102 (1)(g) therefore are not applicable to the appeal.
    Brown v. Davidson, 192 P.3d 415 (Colo. App. 2006), overruled on
    other grounds in Frazier v. Williams, 2017 CO 85, 401 P.3d
    541.</P>
    <P>In expedited appeal under subsection (3), the supreme court
    concluded that the secretary of state may not certify incumbent
    U.S. representative to the 2018 Republican primary ballot. Kuhn
    v. Williams, 2018 CO 30M, 418 P.3d 478.</P>
    <P>
    <B>Section allows a protestor to challenge the underlying
    validity of the information on which the secretary of state
    legitimately relied in verifying a major-party candidate
    petition.</B>In a proceeding brought under this section, a
    protestor may present additional evidence as to a circulator's
    compliance with the strictures of § 1-4-905. In other words,
    the protestors had a narrow opportunity to probe whether a
    particular circulator really was a Colorado resident when he
    acted as a circulator for the campaign of an incumbent U.S.
    representative. Kuhn v. Williams, 2018 CO 30M, 418 P.3d
    478.</P></ANNO-TEXT>

  <M>Legislative declaration.</M></CATCH-LINE>(1)
  <M>The general assembly hereby finds, determines, and declares
  that:</M>
  <P N="(1)(a)">(a)
  <M>The "Help America Vote Act of 2002", Pub.L. 107-252, was
  passed by the United States congress and signed into law by
  president George W. Bush on October 29, 2002.</M></P>
  <P N="(1)(b)">(b)
  <M>HAVA resulted from a national consensus that the nation's
  electoral system needs improvements to ensure that every eligible
  voter has the opportunity to vote, that every vote that should be
  counted will be counted, and that no legal vote will be canceled
  by a fraudulent vote.</M></P>
  <P N="(1)(c)">(c)
  <M>HAVA clearly defines the rights and privileges of those
  eligible individuals who seek to vote, including all overseas and
  military service voters, and seeks to prevent disenfranchisement
  resulting from mistaken determinations of ineligibility to vote,
  the use of outdated voting systems that are unreliable or
  insufficiently accessible for disabled voters, or unnecessary
  administrative obstacles.</M></P>
  <P N="(1)(d)">(d)
  <M>To achieve these purposes, HAVA authorizes significant amounts
  of federal financial assistance to the states to finance the
  purchase of more reliable voting systems and mandates changes in
  the conduct of federal elections in all states for the purposes
  of ensuring greater access to the polls by individuals with
  disabilities, providing more information to individuals who wish
  to vote, improving the training of poll workers, and reducing the
  possibility of fraud in the electoral process.</M></P>
  <P N="(1)(e)">(e)
  <M>As a condition of the receipt of certain funds from the
  federal government under HAVA, section 253 (b)(5) of HAVA
  requires the states to appropriate funds for carrying out the
  activities for which such payments are made in an amount equal to
  five percent of the total amount to be spent for such
  activities.</M></P>
  <P N="(1)(f)">(f)
  <M>HAVA empowers the United States department of justice to bring
  civil actions seeking such declaratory and injunctive relief as
  may be necessary to carry out uniform and nondiscriminatory
  election technology and administration requirements. Accordingly,
  failure to satisfy the requirements of HAVA may subject election
  laws and procedures of this state to stringent review and
  approval by the United States department of justice.</M></P>
  <P N="(1)(g)">(g)
  <M>In order that its requirements may be effectively and
  uniformly implemented, HAVA mandates a greater role for the state
  governments and, in particular, the chief election official of
  each state, in overseeing and coordinating elections and in
  enforcing and implementing uniform standards in
  elections.</M></P>
  <P N="(1)(h)">(h)
  <M>In Colorado, the secretary of state is the chief state
  election official and, in that capacity, is charged by HAVA and
  existing state statutory provisions with responsibility for
  supervising the conduct of elections and for enforcing and
  implementing the provisions of HAVA and of this code.</M></P>
  <P N="(2)">(2)
  <M>Now, therefore, by enacting this article, the general assembly
  intends to:</M></P>
  <P N="(2)(a)">(a)
  <M>Begin the process of implementing the changes in this code
  that are required by HAVA;</M></P>
  <P N="(2)(b)">(b)
  <M>Ensure the timely fulfillment by the state of all requirements
  for eligibility under HAVA to be able to receive appropriated
  federal funds under HAVA; and</M></P>
  <P N="(2)(c)">(c)
  <M>Provide the secretary of state with sufficient authority to
  ensure that the state of Colorado is fully compliant with all
  requirements imposed upon it pursuant to HAVA.</M></P>
  <P N="(3)">(3)

  liberally construed to effectuate its purposes as expressed in

    <B>Federal and state provisions regarding who is authorized to
    file an administrative complaint under the federal Help America
    Vote Act (HAVA) are in conflict because the rule of standing
    under subsection (2)(b) is narrower than, and inconsistent
    with, the federal provision under 42 U.S.C. § 15512(a)(1) and
    (a)(2)(B).</B>Therefore, according to § 1-1.5-103 and 42 U.S.C.
    § 15512 (a)(1), the federal statute must control. Marks v.
    Gessler, 2013 COA 115, 350 P.3d 883. 
    <P>
    <B>Secretary of state's dismissal of complaint for lack of
    standing constituted a final determination on the complaint
    pursuant to subsection (2)(i) and, therefore, the decision was
    appealable to the district court under the appeal clause in
    subsection (4).</B>Marks v. Gessler, 2013 COA 115, 350 P.3d
    883.</P>
    <P>
    <B>The district court did not err in considering complainant's
    state HAVA claims under the judicial review principles of the
    State Administrative Procedure Act (APA) and in remanding the
    case for further administrative proceedings.</B>When considered
    in conjunction with § 24-4-105, the purpose of subsection
    (3)(b) of this section, the so-called "adjudication clause" of
    the state version of the federal HAVA, is to spare the
    secretary and persons filing administrative complaints under
    the state HAVA from having to observe the numerous, and
    somewhat complex, procedural requirements contained in §
    24-4-105, and to curtail the administrative rights and
    obligations the parties would ordinarily have in adjudicatory
    proceedings. The court also rejected the secretary of state's
    assertion that, if a statute precludes the application of the
    administrative procedures under this section, it necessarily
    precludes judicial review under the APA. Accordingly, the
    district court had plenary authority under § 24-4-106 (7) to
    review and remand this case for further proceedings if it
    concluded that the agency acted contrary to law. Marks v.
    Gessler, 2013 COA 115, 350 P.3d 883.</P>
    <P>The exclusive administrative remedy clause under subsection
    (3)(c) does not limit an aggrieved party's judicial remedies.
    The clause does not refer to a complainant's available judicial
    remedies; it refers only to the procedures that constitute the
    administrative remedy for a violation of title III of the
    federal HAVA. The plain meaning of "administrative remedy" does
    not include a judicial remedy. This interpretation is further
    supported by the appeals clause in subsection (4), which allows
    a person aggrieved by a final determination of the secretary to
    appeal the decision to the district court, and thus,
    potentially obtain a judicial remedy. Marks v. Gessler, 2013
    COA 115, 350 P.3d 883.</P>
    <P>
    <B>Although the APA rules and procedures do not apply to the
    secretary's resolution of a state HAVA administrative complaint
    at the agency level, the APA does apply to judicial review in
    the district court of the secretary's
    determination.</B>Subsections (3)(b) and (3)(c) exclude only
    the administrative procedure provisions set forth under §
    24-4-105. They do not limit the availability of judicial
    remedies. At the agency level, a person filing a state HAVA
    administrative complaint is only entitled to administrative
    procedures and rights included in the state HAVA statute itself
    and is not entitled to or burdened by the additional
    administrative procedures, rights, and obligations provided
    under the APA. Marks v. Gessler, 2013 COA 115, 350 P.3d
    883.</P>
    <P>
    <B>Complainant satisfied jurisdictional prerequisites for
    standing as well as the standing requirements to obtain
    judicial review of an agency action under the APA and
    HAVA.</B>Complainant had legal standing to maintain her first
    claim for relief in which she sought judicial review under
    subsection (4) and § 24-4-106 of the dismissal of her state
    HAVA complaint. Because complainant alleged that defendants
    deprived her of her legally protected interests in using the
    administrative complaint procedure to remedy violations of the
    federal HAVA and a hearing on the record in connection with her
    state HAVA administrative complaint, she alleged a sufficient
    injury in fact. Injury in fact is also supported by
    complainant's allegations in her administrative complaint that
    she believed violations of title III of the federal HAVA
    occurred during the 2010 general election. Marks v. Gessler,
    2013 COA 115, 350 P.3d 883.</P>
    <P>Complainant also suffered an injury to a legally protected
    interest. Subsection (2)(b) provides complainant with a right
    to file a state HAVA complaint and subsection (2)(g) states
    that a complainant is entitled to a hearing on the record. In
    addition, complainant has a right under § 24-4-106 (2) of the
    APA to seek judicial review of the agency action. Defendants'
    dismissal of her complaint for lack of standing violated her
    right to file a state HAVA complaint, and, therefore, she was
    adversely affected by the decision. Likewise, subsection (4)
    also provides complainant with a right to seek judicial review
    of the decision. Marks v. Gessler, 2013 COA 115, 350 P.3d
    883.</P></ANNO-TEXT>

  <M>Interest earned on deposits made to the fund.</M></P>
  <P N="(1)(b)">(b)
  <M>All moneys specified in paragraph (a) of this subsection (1)

  <N></N>(a)
  <M>Any moneys received by the state from the federal government
  pursuant to HAVA shall be used by the state only for the purposes
  specified by the provisions of HAVA under which the moneys were
  provided.</M></P>
  <P N="(2)(b)">(b)
  <M>All moneys in the fund are continuously appropriated to the
  department for the proper administration, implementation, and
  enforcement of HAVA in accordance with the requirements of this
  article. All moneys in the fund at the end of each fiscal year
  shall be retained in the fund and shall not revert to the general
  fund or any other fund.</M></P>
  <P N="(3)">(3)
  <M>Subject to available appropriations, the secretary may direct
  that moneys in the department of state cash fund created in
  section 24-21-104 (3)(b), C.R.S., as of July 1, 2003, be used to
  satisfy in whole or in part the requirement of section 253 (b)(5)
  of HAVA that the state appropriate funds for carrying out the
  activities for which federal payments are being made in an amount
  equal to five percent of the total amount to be spent for such
  activities. In order to assist the state in satisfying this
  requirement of HAVA, the secretary may assess the counties for a
  share of the financial requirement assessed against the state
  under HAVA as specified in this subsection (3) and may establish
  by rule a plan to fairly and reasonably allocate the financial
  obligation among the counties pursuant to this subsection
  (3).</M></P>
  <P N="(4)">(4)
  <M>For the 2002-03 fiscal year, and for each fiscal year

  available appropriations, the general assembly shall make an
  annual appropriation to the department out of moneys in the
  department of state cash fund for election-related purposes that
  is not less than the level of expenditures for such purposes
  maintained by the state for the 2001-02 fiscal year.</M></P>
  <P N="(5)">(5)
  <M>For the 2002-03 fiscal year, and for each fiscal year
  thereafter in which the state receives payments from the federal
  government in accordance with Title I of HAVA, and subject to
  available appropriations, the secretary shall maintain out of
  moneys in the department of state cash fund a level of
  expenditures in support of the statewide voter registration
  system created in section 1-2-301 that is not less than the level
  of expenditures for such purposes maintained by the secretary for
  the 2001-02 fiscal year.</M></P>
  <P N="(6)">(6)
  <M>For the county fiscal year that ends prior to November 1,
  2003, and for each county fiscal year thereafter in which the
  state receives payments from the federal government in accordance
  with Title I of HAVA, each county shall maintain not less than
  the same amount of expenditures on activities arising under Title
  III of HAVA that it expended on such activities for its fiscal
  year ending prior to November 2002, excluding moneys expended
  during that period for capital expenditures on new voting
  equipment or any other one-time capital expenditure as determined
  by the secretary.</M></P>
  <P N="(7)">(7)
  <M>The secretary may establish a program pursuant to which the
  secretary may award grants or loans to the counties for the
  purpose of assisting the counties in meeting any of the
  requirements imposed upon them pursuant to HAVA or by this
  article. In connection with the establishment of any such program
  created pursuant to this subsection (7), the secretary shall
  specify, without limitation, qualification requirements for
  eligibility to receive a grant or loan, administration of the
  grant or loan program, criteria for awarding a grant or loan, any
  limit on the total amount of moneys to be awarded in a grant or
  loan pursuant to the requirements of this subsection (7), any
  limit on the amount to be awarded to any one grant or loan
  recipient, auditing or reporting requirements for grant or loan
  recipients, penalty provisions where grant or loan moneys are
  expended improperly, and, in the case of loans, repayment terms.
  Notwithstanding any other provision of law, each loan awarded
  pursuant to this subsection (7) shall bear interest at a
  specified rate.</M></P>
  <P N="(8)">(8)
  <M>In response to the failure by a county to satisfy any of the
  requirements imposed upon it pursuant to this section, the
  secretary may deduct from the reimbursement to which the county
  would ordinarily be entitled pursuant to section 1-5-505.5 the
  amount of moneys owed by the county pursuant to this
  section.</M></P>
  <P N="(9)">(9)
  <M>Any county may donate to the state equipment for voter
  registration purposes in accordance with part 3 of article 2 of
  this title, which equipment is determined to be usable by the
  secretary. In exchange for such donation, the county shall
  receive a credit in the amount of the fair market value of the
  item donated against the financial obligation assessed against
  the county pursuant to subsection (3) of this
  section.</M></P></SECTION-TEXT>

  <M>Rules for determining residence.</M></CATCH-LINE>(1)
  <M>The following rules shall be used to determine the residence
  of a person intending to register or to vote in any precinct in
  this state and shall be used by election judges in challenge
  procedures:</M>
  <P N="(1)(a)(I)">(a)
  <N></N>(I)
  <M>The residence of a person is the principal or primary home or
  place of abode of a person. A principal or primary home or place
  of abode is that home or place in which a person's habitation is
  fixed and to which that person, whenever absent, has the present
  intention of returning after a departure or absence, regardless
  of the duration of the absence. Except as otherwise provided in
  this section, a residence is a permanent building or part of a
  building and may include a house, condominium, apartment, room in
  a house, or mobile home. No vacant lot or business address shall
  be considered a residence.</M></P>
  <P N="(1)(a)(I.5)">(I.5)
  <M>If the residence of an elector is destroyed or becomes
  uninhabitable, due to a natural disaster or for any other reason,
  and the elector has the present intention of returning to the
  residence once it is habitable or returning to a newly
  constructed residence at the same address, the elector may
  continue to use the address of the destroyed or uninhabitable
  residence as the elector's residence.</M></P>
  <P N="(1)(a)(II)">(II)
  <M>For the purpose of voter registration residence, a homeless
  elector shall identify a specific location within a county where
  the elector returns to regularly. This location may include a
  homeless shelter, a homeless services provider, a park, a
  campground, a vacant lot, a business address, or any other
  physical location. If the homeless elector's registration
  residence does not include a mailing address, the elector shall
  also provide a mailing address.</M></P>
  <P N="(1)(b)">(b)
  <M>In determining what is the principal or primary place of abode
  of a person, the following circumstances relating to the person
  shall be taken into account: Business pursuits, employment,
  income sources, residence for income or other tax purposes, age,
  marital status, residence of parents, spouse or civil union
  partner, and children, if any, leaseholds, situs of personal and
  real property, existence of any other residences and the amount
  of time spent at each residence, and motor vehicle
  registration.</M></P>
  <P N="(1)(c)">(c)
  <M>The residence given for voting purposes shall be the same as
  the residence given for motor vehicle registration and for state
  income tax purposes; except that this subsection (1)(c) does not
  apply to an elector using the address of a destroyed or
  uninhabitable residence as the elector's residence pursuant to
  subsection (1)(a)(I.5) of this section.</M></P>
  <P N="(1)(d)">(d)
  <M>A person shall not be considered to have gained a residence in
  this state, or in any county or municipality in this state, while
  retaining a home or domicile elsewhere.</M></P>
  <P N="(1)(e)">(e)
  <M>If a person moves to any other state with the intention of
  making it a permanent residence, that person is considered to
  have lost Colorado residence after twenty-two days' absence from
  this state unless the person has evidenced an intent to retain a
  residence in this state by a self-affirmation executed pursuant
  to section 1-7.5-107 (3)(b.5).</M></P>
  <P N="(1)(f)">(f)
  <M>After a person moves from one residence to another and has
  made the new residence his or her sole legal place of residence,
  the person is considered to have residence at the residence in
  this state to which the person moved.</M></P></SECTION-TEXT>

    <ANNO-TEXT>
    <B>A person is not entitled to vote unless he has adopted the
    state</B>as a fixed and permanent habitation. Merrill v.
    Shearston, 73 Colo. 230, 214 P. 540 (1923). 
    <P>
    <B>And there must not only be a personal presence, but an
    intent</B>to make the place his true home. Merrill v.
    Shearston, 73 Colo. 230, 214 P. 540 (1923).</P>
    <P>
    <B>And a change of voting place is compelling evidence of an
    intention</B>to make a change in residence. Kellner v. Dist.
    Court, 127 Colo. 320, 256 P.2d 887 (1953).</P>
    <P>
    <B>But residence is not acquired by mere intention.</B>People
    v. Turpin, 49 Colo. 234, 112 P. 539 (1910).</P>
    <P>The mere intention to return to a former abode at some more
    or less indefinite time, with no other indicia of a home or
    domicile, may not fulfill the usual requirements of legal
    residence for voting purposes. Gordon v. Blackburn, 618 P.2d
    668 (Colo. 1980).</P>
    <P>
    <B>As the residence contemplated is synonymous with home or
    domicile</B>and means actual settlement within the state. Sharp
    v. McIntire, 23 Colo. 99, 46 P. 115 (1896); People v. Turpin,
    49 Colo. 234, 112 P. 539 (1910).</P>
    <P>
    <B>Hence, mere purchase of home in the state is not
    sufficient.</B>The purchase by a citizen of another state of a
    plantation in this state with a bona fide purpose to remove to
    it, and make it his home as soon as possession can be acquired,
    but in the meantime retaining his former home, does not
    constitute him a resident of this state, though he afterwards,
    pursuing his original purpose, removes to this state and
    establishes himself here. People v. Turpin, 49 Colo. 234, 112
    P. 539 (1910).</P>
    <P>
    <B>For residence and capacity as an elector relate to the day
    of actual settlement</B>in this state, and not to the day when
    the purpose was formed. People v. Turpin, 49 Colo. 234, 112 P.
    539 (1910).</P>
    <P>
    <B>Moreover, one who has a home or domicile in another state
    cannot by a sojourn</B>here, however long, acquire a residence
    in this state, within the meaning of this section, without
    abandoning his former domicile. Sharp v. McIntire, 23 Colo. 99,
    46 P. 115 (1896).</P>
    <P>
    <B>Thus, to effect a change of residence from one state to
    another,</B>there must be an actual removal, an actual change
    of domicile, and a bona fide intention of abandoning the former
    place of residence and establishing a new one. People v.
    Turpin, 49 Colo. 234, 112 P. 539 (1910).</P>
    <P>
    <B>Test of residency after elector moves from precinct.</B>The
    following inquiry is required to be undertaken if an elector
    has moved outside the boundaries of his voting precinct and
    wishes to retain his right to vote there:
    <M>(1)</M>
    <M>Had the party established his principal or primary home or
    place of abode within the election precinct? and (2)</M>
    <M>was the individual's departure taken or does his absence
    continue with a present intention of returning to the precinct
    in the future? Gordon v. Blackburn, 618 P.2d 668 (Colo.
    1980).</M></P>
    <P>
    <B>Intent to keep legal residency central factor.</B>Once a
    person's legal residence has been established, his intent to
    keep it becomes the central factor in determining whether it
    continues. Gordon v. Blackburn, 618 P.2d 668 (Colo. 1980).</P>
    <P>
    <B>Some time limit must be set for determining who is and who
    is not a resident</B>for the purpose of voting, not only to
    preserve the purity of the election but also for administrative
    reasons. Hall v. Beals, 292 F. Supp. 610 (D. Colo. 1968),
    appeal dismissed as moot, 396 U.S. 45, 90 S. Ct. 200, 24 L. Ed.
    2d 214 (1969).</P>
    <P>
    <B>Temporary move for work purposes does not constitute
    abandonment of domicile.</B>Where a man and his wife had
    acquired a domicile in a town and a short while before an
    election they moved to another place where the man had a
    contract to work with the intention of residing there till the
    contract was finished and during the time left their home in
    the town with part of their furniture in the care of another,
    they had not abandoned their domicile and were legally entitled
    to vote at an election in the town of their domicile occurring
    during the time of their residence at the place of the work.
    Jain v. Bossen, 27 Colo. 423, 62 P. 194 (1900).</P>
    <P>
    <B>One does not lose voting rights by reason of departure or
    absence from primary home,</B>once it has been established.
    Gordon v. Blackburn, 618 P.2d 668 (Colo. 1980).</P>
    <P>
    <B>But where a person registers in another state</B>and makes
    declarations to that end, that person cannot legally vote in
    Colorado. Kellner v. Dist. Court, 127 Colo. 320, 256 P.2d 887
    (1953).</P>
    <P>
    <B>The factors listed in subsection (1)(b) for determining an
    elector's residency for voter registration purposes also
    control in determining a circulator's residency under § 1-4-905
    (1).</B>Kuhn v. Williams, 2018 CO 30M, 418 P.3d 478.</P>
    <P>The district court erred as a matter of law by relying
    exclusively on the stated subjective intent of a circulator for
    the campaign of an incumbent U.S. representative, without
    considering the objective indicia of his principal or primary
    place of abode under subsection (1)(b) to determine his
    residency. Because each of the objective factors delineated in
    subsection (1)(b) indicates that another state and not this
    state was the circulator's "primary or principal place of
    abode" as a matter of law, he was not a resident of this state
    during the time he served as a circulator for the campaign.
    Because he did not meet the statutory requirements to be a
    circulator, the signatures he collected must be struck from the
    campaign's candidate-nomination petition. Kuhn v. Williams,
    2018 CO 30M, 418 P.3d 478.</P></ANNO-TEXT>

  <M>Changing or withdrawing declaration of
  affiliation.</M></CATCH-LINE>(1)
  <M>Any eligible elector desiring to change or withdraw the
  elector's affiliation may do so by completing and signing a
  prescribed request for the change or withdrawal and filing it
  with the county clerk and recorder or by submitting a personal
  letter written by the elector to the county clerk and recorder at
  any time up to and including the twenty-second day preceding a
  primary election; except that, if the twenty-second day before
  the primary election is a Saturday, Sunday, or legal holiday, the
  change or withdrawal applies if made by the next day that is not
  a Saturday, Sunday, or legal holiday. The prescribed form or
  personal letter for the change must include the elector's printed
  name, address within the county, birth date, the last four digits
  of the elector's social security number, if the elector wishes to
  state it, and signature, the date, the elector's previous
  affiliation status, and the requested change in affiliation
  status. A prescribed form must be furnished by the county clerk
  and recorder upon the elector's oral or written request. Upon
  receiving the request, the county clerk and recorder shall change
  the elector's affiliation on his or her registration record. If
  the affiliation is withdrawn, the designation on the elector's
  registration record must be changed to "unaffiliated". If an
  elector changes affiliation, the elector is entitled to vote, at
  any primary election, only the ballot of the political party to
  which the elector is currently affiliated. A change or withdrawal
  of affiliation may not be made by anyone other than the elector.
  Notwithstanding any other provision of law, a declaration or
  change of affiliation made by an unaffiliated elector in
  accordance with this section must be deferred if the elector has
  already been mailed a primary election ballot packet. The
  deadline by which the elector must declare, change, or withdraw
  an affiliation as specified in this subsection (1) only applies
  to a primary election and does not apply to a general or
  coordinated election.</M>
  <P N="(2)">(2)
  <M>Any declaration, change, or withdrawal of affiliation made on
  the same form or personal letter as an address or name change
  shall be accepted by the county clerk and recorder if the form or
  personal letter is dated and signed so that it is clearly
  indicated that the elector intended to make the change or
  withdrawal indicated on the form or in the personal letter. An
  elector who is unable to write may request assistance from the
  county clerk and recorder, and the county clerk and recorder
  shall sign the form, witnessing the elector's mark or, on a
  personal letter, the elector shall have his or her signature
  attested to by a notary public.</M></P></SECTION-TEXT>

  <M>Except as provided in section 1-4-104.5, a primary election
  shall be held on the last Tuesday in June of even-numbered years
  to nominate candidates of political parties to be voted for at
  the succeeding general election. Except as provided by section
  1-4-1304 (1.5), only a major political party, as defined in
  section 1-1-104 (22), is entitled to nominate candidates in a
  primary election.</M>
  <P N="(2)(a)">(2)
  <N></N>(a)
  <M>Each political party that is entitled to participate in the
  primary election must have a separate party ballot for use by
  electors affiliated with that political party. An elector is not
  required to vote in the same party primary as the elector voted
  in as part of a presidential primary election occurring in that
  same year, if such an election is held.</M></P>
  <P N="(2)(b)">(b)
  <M>The county clerk and recorder shall send to all active
  electors in the county who have not declared an affiliation or
  provided a ballot preference with a political party a mailing
  that contains the ballots of all of the major political parties.
  In this mailing, the clerk shall also provide written
  instructions advising the elector of the manner in which the
  elector will be in compliance with the requirements of this code
  in selecting and casting the ballot of a major political party.
  An elector may cast the ballot of only one major political party.
  After selecting and casting a ballot of a single major political
  party, the elector shall return the ballot to the clerk. If an
  elector casts and returns to the clerk the ballot of more than
  one major political party, all such ballots returned will be
  rejected and will not be counted.</M></P>
  <P N="(2)(c)">(c)
  <M>The secretary of state may by rule adopt additional ballot
  requirements necessary to avoid voter confusion in voting in
  primary elections.</M></P>
  <P N="(2)(d)">(d)
  <M>The primary election of all political parties shall be held at
  the same time and shall be conducted by the same election
  officials.</M></P>
  <P N="(3)">(3)
  <M>All nominations by major political parties for candidates for
  United States senator, representative in congress, all elective
  state, district, and county officers, and members of the general
  assembly shall be made by primary elections; except that, for
  general elections occurring after January 1, 2001, nominations by
  major political parties for candidates for lieutenant governor
  shall not be made by primary elections and shall be made pursuant
  to section 1-4-502 (3). Neither the secretary of state nor any
  county clerk and recorder shall place on the official general
  election ballot the name of any person as a candidate of any
  major political party who has not been nominated in accordance
  with the provisions of this article, or who has not been
  affiliated with the major political party for the period of time
  required by section 1-4-601, or who does not meet residency
  requirements for the office, if any. The information found on the
  voter registration record of the county of current or previous
  residence of the person seeking to be placed on the ballot is
  admissible as prima facie evidence of compliance with this
  article.</M></P>
  <P N="(4)">(4)
  <M>Except as otherwise provided in this code, all primary
  elections shall be conducted in the same manner as general
  elections insofar as the general election provisions are
  applicable, and the election officers for primary elections have
  the same powers and shall perform the same duties as those
  provided by law for general elections.</M></P>
  <P N="(5)">(5)
  <M>All expenses incurred in the preparation or conduct of the
  primary election shall be paid out of the treasury of the county
  or state, as the case may be, in the same manner as for general
  elections.</M></P></SECTION-TEXT>

  <M>No person except an eligible elector who is at least eighteen
  years of age, unless another age is required by law, is eligible
  to hold any office in this state. No person is eligible to be a
  designee or candidate for office unless that person fully meets
  the qualifications of that office as stated in the constitution
  and statutes of this state on or before the date the term of that
  office begins. The designated election official shall not certify
  the name of any designee or candidate who fails to swear or
  affirm under oath that he or she will fully meet the
  qualifications of the office if elected; or who is unable to
  provide proof that he or she meets any requirements of the office
  relating to registration, residence, or property ownership; or
  who the designated election official determines is not qualified
  to hold the office that he or she seeks based on residency
  requirements. The information found on the person's voter
  registration record is admissible as prima facie evidence of
  compliance with this section.</M>
  <P N="(2)">(2)
  <M>No person is eligible to be a candidate for more than one
  office at one time; except that this subsection (2) does not
  apply to memberships on different special district boards. This
  subsection (2) shall not prohibit a candidate or elected official
  of any political subdivision from being a candidate or member of
  the board of directors of any special district or districts in
  which he or she is an eligible elector, unless otherwise
  prohibited by law.</M></P>
  <P N="(3)">(3)
  <M>The qualification of any candidate may be challenged by an
  eligible elector of the political subdivision within five days
  after the designated election official's statement is issued that
  certifies the candidate to the ballot. The challenge shall be
  made by verified petition setting forth the facts alleged
  concerning the qualification of the candidate and shall be filed
  in the district court in the county in which the political
  subdivision is located. The hearing on the qualification of the
  candidate shall be held in not less than five nor more than ten
  days after the date the election official's statement is issued
  that certifies the candidate to the ballot. The court shall hear
  the testimony and other evidence and, within forty-eight hours
  after the close of the hearing, determine whether the candidate
  meets the qualifications for the office for which the candidate
  has declared. Provisions of section 13-17-101, C.R.S., regarding
  frivolous, groundless, or vexatious actions shall apply to this
  section.</M></P></SECTION-TEXT>

    specific challenge to the qualification of a candidate if made
    by filing a verified petition with the district court within
    five days of his or her certification to the ballot, the two
    provisions very much appear to be in conflict. Because effect
    can reasonably be given to both provisions and because this
    section is the later adopted of the two, the legislative
    prescription for this conflict is to give effect to subsection
    (3) of this section as the special, or more specific,

  before the assembly, unless otherwise provided by party
  rules:</M></P>
  <P N="(1.5)(a)">(a)

  <N></N>(a)
  <M>An assembly must take no more than two ballots for party
  candidates for each office to be filled at the next general
  election. Every candidate receiving thirty percent or more of the
  votes of all duly accredited assembly delegates who are present
  and voting on that office must be certified by affidavit of the
  presiding officer and secretary of the assembly. If no candidate
  receives thirty percent or more of the votes of all duly
  accredited assembly delegates who are present and voting, a
  second ballot must be cast on all the candidates for that office.
  If on the second ballot no candidate receives thirty percent or
  more of the votes cast, the two candidates receiving the highest
  number of votes must be certified as candidates for that office
  by the assembly. The certificate of designation by assembly must
  state the name of the office for which each person is a candidate
  and the candidate's name and address, must designate in not more
  than three words the name of the political party which the
  candidate represents, and must certify that the candidate has
  been a member of the political party for the period of time
  required by party rule or by subsection (4) of this section if
  the party has no such rule. The candidate's affiliation, as shown
  in the statewide voter registration system, is prima facie
  evidence of political party membership. The certificate of
  designation must indicate the order of the vote received at the
  assembly by candidates for each office, but no assembly shall
  declare that any one candidate has received the nomination of the
  assembly. The certificate of designation must be filed in
  accordance with section 1-4-604. If two or more candidates
  receiving designation under this subsection (2) have received an
  equal number of votes, the order of certification of designation
  is determined by lot by the candidates. The assembly shall select
  a vacancy committee for vacancies in designation or nomination
  only.</M></P>

  transmission. If the acceptance is transmitted by facsimile
  transmission, the original acceptance must also be filed and
  postmarked no later than ten days after the adjournment of the
  assembly. The acceptance shall state the candidate's name in the
  form in which it is to appear on the ballot. The name may include
  one nickname, if the candidate regularly uses the nickname and
  the nickname does not include any part of a political party name.
  If an acceptance is not filed within the specified time, the
  candidate shall be deemed to have declined the designation;
  except that the candidate shall not be deemed to have declined
  the designation and shall be included on the primary ballot if
  late filing of an acceptance is caused by the failure to timely
  file a certificate of designation or the failure to file such
  acceptance with such certificate of designation, as required by
  section 1-4-604 (1)(a).</M></P>
  <P N="(3)(b)">(b)
  <M>The written acceptance of a candidate nominated by assembly

  such assembly, as required by section 1-4-604 (1)(a). Nothing in
  this paragraph (b) shall prohibit a candidate from filing an

    <B>In addition to nominees designated by party assembly,</B>a
    party member desirous of the party's nomination at the primary
    election may become a candidate by filing a petition signed by
    the requisite number of the electors of his party residing

    Colo. 533, 444 P.2d 878 (1968).</P>
    <P>
    <B>The purpose in allowing nominations by individuals</B>is to
    confer upon electors the right to place candidates in
    nomination under some party name which they might choose,

    nominating candidates for the legislative and senatorial

    <P>
    <B>The oath required is a matter of substance, as affording
    prima facie proof</B>that the persons so subscribing the

  further finds that prescribing certain additional review
  processes for the documentation evidencing designations and
  nominations of candidates that are not onerous will serve to
  minimize the likelihood of a candidate being deprived of his or
  her candidacy and of an erroneous primary election ballot. The
  general assembly further encourages the responsible officials to
  engage in the enhanced communication and review described in this
  subsection (6) well in advance of statutorily prescribed
  deadlines or ballot certification dates, if possible, in order to
  maximize the time for giving notice and resolving any issues that
  may arise from the primary ballot nomination

    <AN-DIV>II.
    <M>PURPOSE.</M></AN-DIV>
    <ANNO-TEXT>
    <B>The purpose of providing for nomination by petition</B>is to
    permit electors to make independent nominations for public
    offices by petition under a name they may lawfully choose, and
    to vote for such nominees by that designation. Pease v. Wilkin,
    53 Colo. 404, 127 P. 230 (1912). 
    <P>
    <B>In order to give the electors the widest possible latitude
    in naming candidates,</B>candidates can be nominated by
    petition direct, without submitting their candidacy to a vote
    at the primary election. Pease v. Wilkin, 53 Colo. 404, 127 P.
    230 (1912).</P></ANNO-TEXT>
    <AN-DIV>III.
    <M>REQUISITES FOR NOMINATION.</M></AN-DIV>
    <ANNO-TEXT>
    <B>No violation of equal protection.</B>Requirement that each
    nominating petition circulated by an individual or political
    organization contain the name of a single candidate only does
    not violate equal protection. Nat'l Prohibition Party v. State
    of Colo., 752 P.2d 80 (Colo. 1988); Colo. Libertarian Party v.
    Sec'y of State, 817 P.2d 998 (Colo. 1991), cert. denied, 503
    U.S. 985, 112 S. Ct. 1670, 118 L. Ed. 2d 390 (1992). 
    <P>
    <B>Application of that portion of subsection (1)(g) requiring a
    congressional candidate to be an eligible elector of the
    congressional district in which he seeks election violates the
    qualifications clause of the U.S. constitution.</B>Campbell v.
    Buckley, 46 F. Supp. 2d 1115 (D. Colo. 1999), aff'd, 233 F.3d
    1229 (10th Cir. 2000), cert. denied, 532 U.S. 973, 121 S. Ct.
    1605, 149 L. Ed. 2d 471 (2001).</P>
    <P>
    <B>The requirement of subsection (1)(i) (now (1)(g)) that a
    person be registered as "unaffiliated" for a period of one
    year</B>as a prerequisite for running for public office is
    constitutional. Thournir v. Meyer, 708 F. Supp. 1183 (D. Colo.
    1989).</P>
    <P>
    <B>Legislative intent of subsection (1)(g) is clear:</B>No
    unaffiliated candidate may be on the ballot unless registered
    as an unaffiliated voter at least 12 months prior to last date
    for filing applications. Conte v. Meyer, 882 P.2d 962 (Colo.
    1994).</P>
    <P>
    <B>In order to make nominations by individuals two things are
    necessary:</B>(1) The filing of a certificate with the proper
    officer substantially in the form required by law containing
    the requisite number of signatures of persons entitled to sign;
    and (2) an acceptance on the part of the candidates so named.
    O'Connor v. Smithers, 45 Colo. 23, 99 P. 46 (1908).</P>
    <P>
    <B>Unless the latter accept, they are not nominees,</B>and are
    no more candidates, or affected by the petitions filed, than if
    none had ever been filed. O'Connor v. Smithers, 45 Colo. 23, 99
    P. 46 (1908).</P></ANNO-TEXT>
    <AN-DIV>IV.
    <M>REQUIREMENTS OF SECTION.</M></AN-DIV>
    <ANNO-TEXT>
    <B>The electors are not required to state</B>anything in the
    petition regarding the political affiliation of the nominees.
    Pease v. Wilkin, 53 Colo. 404, 127 P. 230 (1912). 
    <P>
    <B>The subscriber's character as a voter is established by
    affidavit;</B>no more can be required. Benson v. Gillespie, 62
    Colo. 206, 161 P. 295 (1916).</P>
    <P>
    <B>One who has accepted the nomination of a political party may
    be nominated by petition</B>of independent voters, assuming a
    different party designation. Pease v. Wilkin, 53 Colo. 404, 127
    P. 230 (1912).</P>
    <P>
    <B>The unaffiliation requirement of subsection (1)(i) (now
    (1)(g)) is not unconstitutional</B>because it serves the
    compelling state interest of protecting the integrity of
    Colorado's balloting process and it does not unnecessarily or
    unfairly impinge on a prospective candidate's right of access
    to the ballot. Colo. Libertarian Party v. Sec'y of State, 817
    P.2d 998 (Colo. 1991), cert. denied, 503 U.S. 985, 112 S. Ct.

    <AN-DIV>V.
    <M>FILING.</M></AN-DIV>
    <ANNO-TEXT>
    <B>The words "not less than" do not require full clear
    days.</B>The words "not less than" prefixed to the number of
    days specified in the provision for nomination by petition do
    not require full clear days. The time limitation is to be
    interpreted as if the words had been omitted. Luedke v. Todd,
    109 Colo. 326, 124 P.2d 932 (1942). 
    <P>
    <B>Thus a certificate of nomination filed with the town
    clerk</B>on February 21st would still be in time for a town
    election to be held on April 7th. Luedke v. Todd, 109 Colo.
    326, 142 P.2d 932 (1942).</P>
    <P>
    <B>Secretary of state or deputy may pass on validity of
    petition.</B>Although petitions for nominating independent
    candidates for offices to be voted on by the entire state are
    properly filed with the secretary of state, the secretary of
    state is not vested solely with the decision-making power in
    passing upon the validity of objections to such petition
    because the secretary of state has the power to appoint a
    deputy to act for the secretary if the secretary deems it
    necessary, and the deputy shall have full authority to act in
    all things relating to the office. Olshaw v. Buchanan, 186
    Colo. 362, 527 P.2d 545 (1974).</P></ANNO-TEXT>
    <AN-DIV>VI.
    <M>PROTECTION OF NAME OF PARTY.</M></AN-DIV>
    <ANNO-TEXT>
    <B>Nominations by petitions protected in same manner as
    nominations by convention.</B>The nomination, by petition, of
    the candidates of an organized party, authorized by such party,
    are to be protected to the same extent, and in the same manner,
    as nominations made by convention, even though such party have
    not sufficient strength to make nominations by convention.
    Philips v. Smith, 25 Colo. 456, 55 P. 184 (1898); McBroom v.
    Brown, 53 Colo. 412, 127 P. 957 (1912). 
    <P>
    <B>The authorized use by others of the name of such
    party,</B>in a petition making nominations for an approaching
    election, even though prior in point of time to a certificate
    presented by the proper authorities of the party, will not
    prevent the filing of the latter. Philips v. Smith, 25 Colo.
    456, 55 P. 184 (1898); McBroom v. Brown, 53 Colo. 412, 127 P.
    957 (1912).</P>
    <P>
    <B>Name may not be appropriated by others.</B>The name adopted
    by a new political party placed on a ballot by petition is not
    subject to appropriation by other petitioners. McBroom v.
    Brown, 53 Colo. 412, 127 P. 957 (1912).</P>
    <P>
    <B>Section unenforceable.</B>In light of the Colorado Supreme
    Court decision in McBroom v. Brown, 53 Colo. 412, 127 P. 957
    (1912), this section which distinguishes between political
    parties and political organizations by only allowing parties to
    prevent unendorsed candidates from running under the party name
    is unenforceable. Baer v. Meyer, 577 F. Supp. 838 (D. Colo.
    1984), aff'd in part and rev'd in part on other grounds, 728
    F.2d 471 (10th Cir. 1984).</P></ANNO-TEXT>

    <ANNO-TEXT>
    <B>Annotator's note.</B>The following annotations are taken
    from cases decided under former provisions similar to this
    section. 
    <P>
    <B>Failure to pursue remedies under the objection provision
    does not constitute waiver</B>of the right of an elector to
    contest the eligibility of one to be a candidate of his
    political party. Ray v. Mickelson, 196 Colo. 325, 584 P.2d 1215
    (1978).</P></ANNO-TEXT>
    <AN-DIV>II. APPARENT CONFORMITY.</AN-DIV>
    <ANNO-TEXT>
    <B>The secretary of state, in the absence of objection, is not
    vested with authority</B>to refuse to certify a nomination
    because he has some objection to it for some substantial
    reason. Mills v. Newell, 30 Colo. 377, 70 P. 405 (1902). 
    <P>
    <B>He may, on his own motion, refuse to file a
    certificate,</B>based on some formal ground. Mills v. Newell,
    30 Colo. 377, 70 P. 405 (1902).</P>
    <P>
    <B>But if it is "in apparent conformity" with the applicable
    provisions</B>the secretary may not, of his own motion, and in
    the absence of some objection based upon matters of substance,
    refuse to certify the nomination. Mills v. Newell, 30 Colo.
    377, 70 P. 405 (1902).</P>
    <P>
    <B>The law regards certificates of nomination as having been
    filed</B>where the parties presenting them did all that was
    possible in complying with the designation and nomination
    provision even though the secretary of state refused to file
    the certificate. Mills v. Newell, 30 Colo. 377, 70 P. 405
    (1902).</P>
    <P>
    <B>The objection provision does not contemplate that void
    certificates of nomination can be cured</B>or amended so as to
    make them valid after the time for filing such certificates of
    nomination has expired. O'Connor v. Smithers, 45 Colo. 23, 99
    P. 46 (1908).</P></ANNO-TEXT>
    <AN-DIV>III. PROCEEDINGS SUMMARY.</AN-DIV>
    <ANNO-TEXT>
    <B>The formalities which are required in ordinary civil
    actions</B>need not be strictly observed in proceedings based
    on objections to designations and nominations. Phillips v.
    Curley, 28 Colo. 34, 62 P. 837 (1900).</ANNO-TEXT>
    <AN-DIV>IV. JURISDICTION.</AN-DIV>
    <ANNO-TEXT>
    <B>The filing officers in the first instance and the courts
    upon review have jurisdiction</B>to determine the regularity of
    party conventions and the claims of rival factions of the same
    political party to have their nominees placed on the official
    ballot. Leighton v. Bates, 24 Colo. 303, 50 P. 856, 50 P. 858
    (1897); Liggett v. Bates, 24 Colo. 314, 50 P. 860 (1897);
    Whipple v. Owen, 24 Colo. 319, 50 P. 861 (1897); McCoach v.
    Whipple, 24 Colo. 379, 51 P. 164 (1897); Whipple v. Broad, 25
    Colo. 407, 55 P. 172 (1898); Whipple v. Wheeler, 25 Colo. 421,
    55 P. 188 (1898); Spencer v. Maloney, 28 Colo. 38, 62 P. 850
    (1900). 
    <P>
    <B>The decision of the filing officer as to formal matters in a
    certificate of nomination is final.</B>Leighton v. Bates, 24
    Colo. 303, 50 P. 856 (1897).</P>
    <P>
    <B>But his decisions of matters of substance are reviewable by
    lower courts.</B>Leighton v. Bates, 24 Colo. 303, 50 P. 856
    (1897).</P>
    <P>
    <B>And when reviewed by a lower court</B>in the manner
    prescribed, the decision of such lower court is final. Leighton
    v. Bates, 24 Colo. 303, 50 P. 856 (1897).</P>
    <P>
    <B>Subject only to the power of the supreme court,</B>in its
    discretion, to review summarily the judicial proceeding below.
    Leighton v. Bates, 24 Colo. 303, 50 P. 856
    (1897).</P></ANNO-TEXT>
    <AN-DIV>V. REVIEW.</AN-DIV>
    <ANNO-TEXT>
    <B>A review is ordinarily had of record only,</B>and as made by
    the lower tribunal. Leighton v. Bates, 24 Colo. 303, 50 P. 856
    (1897). 
    <P>
    <B>Yet the review may not be so limited.</B>Leighton v. Bates,
    24 Colo. 303, 50 P. 856 (1897).</P>
    <P>
    <B>Because of accompanying or explanatory words, the review may
    be enlarged</B>so as to embrace the taking of additional
    evidence, or practically to constitute a trial de novo.
    Leighton v. Bates, 24 Colo. 303, 50 P. 856 (1897).</P>
    <P>
    <B>The review in the trial courts contemplated by the objection
    provision</B>was such as the section on settlement of
    controversies provided. Leighton v. Bates, 24 Colo. 303, 50 P.
    856 (1897).</P>
    <P>
    <B>And it is clear that the provision for settlement of
    controversies contemplates</B>the taking of evidence where the
    issues require it. Leighton v. Bates, 24 Colo. 303, 50 P. 856
    (1897).</P>
    <P>
    <B>The objection provision does not contemplate a review in
    supreme court of the same character</B>as that provided for in
    county or district court. Liggett v. Bates, 24 Colo. 314, 50 P.
    860 (1897).</P>
    <P>
    <B>Review in the supreme court is to be upon the record</B>as
    made in the lower court. Liggett v. Bates, 24 Colo. 314, 50 P.
    860 (1897).</P>
    <P>
    <B>Decision of trial court will not be disturbed except for
    strong and persuasive reasons.</B>Since the decision of the
    trial court is final, that decision should not be disturbed
    except for strong and persuasive reasons. Liggett v. Bates, 24
    Colo. 314, 50 P. 860 (1897).</P>
    <P>
    <B>The supreme court should interfere</B>if the trial court
    acts without jurisdiction, or in excess thereof, or acts
    arbitrarily, or grossly abuses its discretion. Liggett v.
    Bates, 24 Colo. 314, 50 P. 860 (1897).</P>
    <P>
    <B>Supreme court may in its discretion accept or reject an
    appeal</B>with respect to nominations of candidates, and if it
    elects to accept the appeal, it may proceed in a summary way to
    dispose of it. In re Weber, 186 Colo. 61, 525 P.2d 465
    (1974).</P>
    <P>The matter of review by the supreme court, in an action to
    compel a town clerk to accept and file certificate of
    nomination and to certify and have printed on the official
    ballot the names of certain candidates, is entirely
    discretionary with the court. Luedke v. Todd, 109 Colo. 326,
    124 P.2d 932 (1942).</P>
    <P>
      <B>Objection to petition not raised before county clerk
      cannot be raised on review.</B>
      <M>In a proceeding to protest the placing of nominations upon
      the official ballot, an objection that the petition failed to
      show the authority of the petitioner to make the protest, if
      not raised before the county clerk, cannot be raised on
      review. Phillips v. Curley, 28 Colo. 34, 62 P. 837
      (1900).</M>
    </P>
    <P>
    <B>In order to invoke the appellate jurisdiction of the supreme
    court,</B>in the exercise of its discretion to review the
    proceedings of the lower court determining the validity of
    objections to certificates of nomination, a certified copy of
    the record and judgment of the trial court, or the material
    parts thereof, sufficient to present the questions relied upon,
    with a brief petition stating the nature of the controversy,
    the points at issue, and the errors relied upon, should be
    filed in the supreme court. Liggett v. Bates, 24 Colo. 314, 50
    P. 860 (1897).</P>
    <P>
    <B>A motion should then be made,</B>based upon this petition,
    asking the court to exercise its appellate jurisdiction,
    specifying time and place of hearing of the application.
    Liggett v. Bates, 24 Colo. 314, 50 P. 860 (1897).</P>
    <P>
    <B>And notice of the motion should be served</B>upon the
    opposing party. Liggett v. Bates, 24 Colo. 314, 50 P. 860
    (1897).</P>
    <P>
    <B>In an action to compel a county clerk to receive and file
    nominations for county offices</B>which was refused by him on
    the ground that no election for such offices could be held at
    the ensuing election, where in the absence of one of the judges
    of the supreme court the other two disagree as to whether the
    court should exercise its discretion to review the judgment of
    the lower court even if it has jurisdiction to do so, the
    proceeding must be dismissed and it is unnecessary to determine
    whether or not the court has jurisdiction to review the
    judgment of the lower court. Beach v. Berdel, 31 Colo. 505, 74
    P. 1129 (1903).</P>
    <P>
    <B>District judge was interested in the result and disqualified
    to try cause.</B>Where a list of nominations for county
    officers filed with the county clerk was protested on the
    ground that the party name assumed was an infringement on the
    name of another political party and tended to deceive the
    voters, a district judge who had been nominated under the same
    party name and the nomination filed with the secretary of state
    was interested in the result and disqualified to try the cause,
    although the judgment in the cause would not directly affect
    his own nomination, since it involved the determination of a
    question which if raised in the proper tribunal would determine
    the validity of his own nomination on the ticket. Phillips v.
    Curley, 28 Colo. 34, 62 P. 837 (1900).</P></ANNO-TEXT>

  accordance with section 1-4-907, the secretary of state shall
  compare each signature on a candidate petition with the signature

  match, a second review shall be made by an employee of the
  secretary of state's office or a designee trained in signature
  verification. If the employee or designee agrees that the

  three days of determining the signature deficiency, notify the
  candidate of such deficiency.</M></P>
  <P N="(1.5)(b)(II)">(II)
  <M>To cure a signature that failed the signature verification
  process described in subsection (1.5)(b)(I) of this section, a
  candidate must provide the secretary of state with a statement,
  signed by the elector whose signature failed the verification
  process, that states substantially that the elector signed the
  petition. The statement must be accompanied by a copy of the
  elector's identification, as defined in section 1-1-104 (19.5).
  The secretary of state shall prescribe the form for the
  statement. To cure the signature deficiency, the candidate must

  to the secretary of state within three days of the date the
  secretary notifies the candidate of the signature
  deficiency.</M></P>

  petition.</M></P>
  <P N="(3)">(3)
  <M>After review, the official shall notify the candidate of the
  number of valid signatures and whether the petition appears to be
  sufficient or insufficient. In the case of a petition for
  nominating an unaffiliated candidate, the official shall provide
  notification of sufficiency or insufficiency to the candidate no
  later than ninety-six days before the general election. Upon
  determining that the petition is sufficient and after the time
  for protest has passed, the designated election official shall
  certify the candidate to the ballot, and, if the election is a
  coordinated election, so notify the coordinated election
  official.</M></P>

    <B>Annotator's note.</B>The following annotations include cases
    decided under former provisions similar to this section. 
    <P>
    <B>Failure to pursue remedies under the objection provision
    does not constitute waiver</B>of the right of an elector to
    contest the eligibility of one to be a candidate of his
    political party. Ray v. Mickelson, 196 Colo. 325, 584 P.2d 1215
    (1978).</P></ANNO-TEXT>
    <AN-DIV>II.
    <M>APPARENT CONFORMITY.</M></AN-DIV>
    <ANNO-TEXT>
    <B>The secretary of state, in the absence of objection, is not
    vested with authority</B>to refuse to certify a nomination
    because he has some objection to it for some substantive
    reason. Mills v. Newell, 30 Colo. 377, 70 P. 405 (1902). 
    <P>
    <B>He may, on his own motion, refuse to file a
    certificate,</B>based on some formal ground. Mills v. Newell,
    30 Colo. 377, 70 P. 405 (1902).</P>
    <P>
    <B>But if it is "in apparent conformity" with the applicable
    provisions</B>the secretary may not, of his own motion, and in
    the absence of some objection based upon matters of substance,
    refuse to certify the nomination. Mills v. Newell, 30 Colo.
    377, 70 P. 405 (1902).</P>
    <P>
    <B>The law regards certificates of nomination as having been
    filed</B>where the parties presenting them did all that was
    possible in complying with the designation and nomination
    provision even though the secretary of state refused to file
    the certificate. Mills v. Newell, 30 Colo. 377, 70 P. 405
    (1902).</P>
    <P>
    <B>The objection provision does not contemplate that void
    certificates of nomination can be cured</B>or amended so as to
    make them valid after the time for filing such certificates of
    nomination has expired. O'Connor v. Smithers, 45 Colo. 23, 99

    <ANNO-TEXT>
    <B>The filing officers in the first instance and the courts
    upon review have jurisdiction</B>to determine the regularity of
    party conventions and the claims of rival factions of the same
    political party to have their nominees placed on the official
    ballot. Leighton v. Bates, 24 Colo. 303, 50 P. 856, 50 P. 858
    (1897); Liggett v. Bates, 24 Colo. 314, 50 P. 860 (1897);

    <B>The decision of the filing officer as to formal matters in a

    <P>

    <M>REVIEW.</M></AN-DIV>
    <ANNO-TEXT>
    <B>A review is ordinarily had of record only,</B>and as made by
    the lower tribunal. Leighton v. Bates, 24 Colo. 303, 50 P. 856
    (1897). 
    <P>
    <B>Yet the review may not be so limited.</B>Leighton v. Bates,
    24 Colo. 303, 50 P. 856 (1897).</P>
    <P>
    <B>Because of accompanying or explanatory words, the review may
    be enlarged</B>so as to embrace the taking of additional
    evidence, or practically to constitute a trial de novo.
    Leighton v. Bates, 24 Colo. 303, 50 P. 856 (1897).</P>
    <P>
    <B>The review in the trial courts contemplated by the objection
    provision</B>was such as the section on settlement of
    controversies provided. Leighton v. Bates, 24 Colo. 303, 50 P.
    856 (1897).</P>
    <P>
    <B>And it is clear that the provision for settlement of
    controversies contemplates</B>the taking of evidence where the
    issues require it. Leighton v. Bates, 24 Colo. 303, 50 P. 856
    (1897).</P>
    <P>
    <B>The objection provision does not contemplate a review in
    supreme court of the same character</B>as that provided for in
    county or district court. Liggett v. Bates, 24 Colo. 314, 50 P.
    860 (1897).</P>
    <P>
    <B>Review in the supreme court is to be upon the record</B>as
    made in the lower court. Liggett v. Bates, 24 Colo. 314, 50 P.
    860 (1897).</P>
    <P>
    <B>Decision of trial court will not be disturbed except for
    strong and persuasive reasons.</B>Since the decision of the
    trial court is final, that decision should not be disturbed
    except for strong and persuasive reasons. Liggett v. Bates, 24
    Colo. 314, 50 P. 860 (1897).</P>
    <P>
    <B>The supreme court should interfere</B>if the trial court
    acts without jurisdiction, or in excess thereof, or acts
    arbitrarily, or grossly abuses its discretion. Liggett v.
    Bates, 24 Colo. 314, 50 P. 860 (1897).</P>
    <P>
    <B>Supreme court may in its discretion accept or reject an
    appeal</B>with respect to nominations of candidates, and if it
    elects to accept the appeal, it may proceed in a summary way to
    dispose of it. In re Weber, 186 Colo. 61, 525 P.2d 465
    (1974).</P>
    <P>The matter of review by the supreme court, in an action to
    compel a town clerk to accept and file certificate of
    nomination and to certify and have printed on the official
    ballot the names of certain candidates, is entirely
    discretionary with the court. Luedke v. Todd, 109 Colo. 326,
    124 P.2d 932 (1942).</P>
    <P>
      <B>Objection to petition not raised before county clerk
      cannot be raised on review.</B>
      <M>In a proceeding to protest the placing of nominations upon
      the official ballot, an objection that the petition failed to
      show the authority of the petitioner to make the protest, if
      not raised before the county clerk, cannot be raised on
      review. Phillips v. Curley, 28 Colo. 34, 62 P. 837
      (1900).</M>
    </P>
    <P>
    <B>In order to invoke the appellate jurisdiction of the supreme
    court,</B>in the exercise of its discretion to review the
    proceedings of the lower court determining the validity of
    objections to certificates of nomination, a certified copy of
    the record and judgment of the trial court, or the material
    parts thereof, sufficient to present the questions relied upon,
    with a brief petition stating the nature of the controversy,
    the points at issue, and the errors relied upon, should be
    filed in the supreme court. Liggett v. Bates, 24 Colo. 314, 50
    P. 860 (1897).</P>
    <P>
    <B>A motion should then be made,</B>based upon this petition,
    asking the court to exercise its appellate jurisdiction,
    specifying time and place of hearing of the application.
    Liggett v. Bates, 24 Colo. 314, 50 P. 860 (1897).</P>
    <P>
    <B>And notice of the motion should be served</B>upon the
    opposing party. Liggett v. Bates, 24 Colo. 314, 50 P. 860
    (1897).</P>
    <P>
    <B>In an action to compel a county clerk to receive and file
    nominations for county offices</B>which was refused by him on
    the ground that no election for such offices could be held at
    the ensuing election, where in the absence of one of the judges
    of the supreme court the other two disagree as to whether the
    court should exercise its discretion to review the judgment of
    the lower court even if it has jurisdiction to do so, the
    proceeding must be dismissed and it is unnecessary to determine
    whether or not the court has jurisdiction to review the
    judgment of the lower court. Beach v. Berdel, 31 Colo. 505, 74
    P. 1129 (1903).</P>
    <P>
    <B>District judge was interested in the result and disqualified
    to try cause.</B>Where a list of nominations for county
    officers filed with the county clerk was protested on the
    ground that the party name assumed was an infringement on the
    name of another political party and tended to deceive the
    voters, a district judge who had been nominated under the same
    party name and the nomination filed with the secretary of state
    was interested in the result and disqualified to try the cause,
    although the judgment in the cause would not directly affect
    his own nomination, since it involved the determination of a
    question which if raised in the proper tribunal would determine
    the validity of his own nomination on the ticket. Phillips v.
    Curley, 28 Colo. 34, 62 P. 837 (1900).</P>
    <P>
    <B>Subsection (1) affords a narrow opportunity to challenge the
    validity of a candidate's petition before the secretary of
    state certifies the candidate to the ballot,</B>even if it
    appeared to be sufficient in a paper review. Kuhn v. Williams,
    2018 CO 30M, 418 P.3d 478.</P>
    <P>Petitioners properly availed themselves of that opportunity
    and challenged the residency of some of the petition
    circulators for the campaign of an incumbent U.S.
    representative. The district court improperly focused on
    circulator's stated future intent to move to this state rather
    than considering whether he presently has a primary or
    principal place of abode here to which he presently intended to
    return, as confirmed by objective indicia of such residency.
    The circulator was not a state resident when he acted as a
    circulator for the campaign. Kuhn v. Williams, 2018 CO 30M, 418
    P.3d 478.</P></ANNO-TEXT>

    <B>Annotator's note.</B>The following annotations include a
    case decided under former provisions similar to this section. 
    <P>
    <B>The "vacancy" section must be construed in the light of the
    two-pronged framework for the designation and nomination of
    candidates</B>either by the party assembly or by petition.
    Anderson v. Mullaney, 166 Colo. 533, 444 P.2d 878 (1968).</P>
    <P>
    <B>A vacancy comes into being</B>when a party assembly fails to
    designate any candidate for nomination to a particular office.
    Anderson v. Mullaney, 166 Colo. 533, 444 P.2d 878 (1968).</P>
    <P>
    <B>And such "vacancy" continues to exist until it is filled by
    the party central committee</B>or the time for filing it
    expires by the term of the statute. Anderson v. Mullaney, 166
    Colo. 533, 444 P.2d 878 (1968).</P>
    <P>
    <B>The "vacancy" created by the party assembly's failure to
    designate a candidate for nomination may be filled</B>by the
    subsequent action of the appropriate party central committee.
    Anderson v. Mullaney, 166 Colo. 533, 444 P.2d 878 (1968).</P>
    <P>
    <B>This is true even though a candidate for party
    nomination</B>has in the interim between the assembly and the
    action of the central committee been placed on the primary
    ballot by petition. Anderson v. Mullaney, 166 Colo. 533, 444
    P.2d 878 (1968).</P>
    <P>
    <B>8 Colo. Code Regs. 1505-1, § 10.7.5, of the secretary of
    state's rules regarding the treatment of votes cast for
    ineligible candidates conflicts with this section and is
    therefore void.</B>Subsection (2.5)(a) of this section provides
    that, where a vacancy occurs less than eighteen days before an
    election due to a partisan candidate's disqualification, votes
    cast in that election for that disqualified candidate are to be
    counted and recorded. The rule contravenes subsection (2.5)(a)
    by directing that, where a designated election official has
    determined that a person appearing on the ballot is not
    qualified for office, any votes cast for that person are
    invalid and must not be counted. Because the rule conflicts
    with statute, it is therefore void. Hanlen v. Gessler, 2014 CO
    24, 333 P.3d 41.</P></ANNO-TEXT>

  limited to, the failure of any portion of a petition or
  circulator affidavit to meet the requirements of this section. No
  signature may be challenged that is not identified in the protest
  by section and line number. The county clerk and recorder shall
  forthwith mail a copy of such protest to the persons designated
  as representing the petition proponents pursuant to paragraph (b)
  of subsection (2) of this section and to the protester, together
  with a notice fixing a time for hearing such protest that is not
  less than five or more than ten days after such notice is

  officer, and the testimony in every such hearing shall be under
  oath. The hearing officer shall have the power to issue subpoenas
  and compel the attendance of witnesses. The hearing shall be
  summary and not subject to delay and shall be concluded within
  sixty days after the petition is filed. No later than five days
  after the conclusion of the hearing, the hearing officer shall
  issue a written determination of whether the petition is
  sufficient or not sufficient. If the hearing officer determines
  that a petition is not sufficient, the officer shall identify
  those portions of the petition that are not sufficient and the
  reasons therefor. The result of the hearing shall be forthwith
  certified to the protester and to the persons designated as
  representing the petition proponents pursuant to paragraph (b) of
  subsection (2) of this section. The determination as to petition
  sufficiency may be reviewed by the district court for the county
  upon application of the protester, the persons designated as
  representing the petition proponents, or the county, but such
  review shall be had and determined forthwith.</M></P>

    <B>In case of the election of officers for the executive or

    be filled at the election, he must likewise give 30 days'

    <B>The requirement that notice be published</B>and posted for
    10 days before the election is specific, precise and definite.
    People ex rel. Dix v. Kerwin, 10 Colo. App. 472, 51 P. 530
    (1897). 
    <P>
    <B>The theory of elections is that there shall be due notice
    given to the voters,</B>and that they must be advised either by
    a direct notice published by the clerk or by proceedings taken
    by the voters and the people generally in such way as that it
    may be fairly inferred that it was generally and thoroughly
    well understood that a particular office was to be filled at
    the election, so that the voters should act understandingly and
    intelligently in casting their ballots. People ex rel. Dix v.

    notwithstanding lack of notice.</B>See People ex rel. Dix v.

    <P>
    <B>For the notice requirement is not necessarily under all
    circumstances and at all times so far mandatory</B>that a
    failure to observe it will defeat an election otherwise
    regularly held. People ex rel. Dix v. Kerwin, 10 Colo. App.

    <B>The notice requirement is clearly intended for the benefit

    Publ'g Co. v. Hoag, 54 Colo. 542, 131 P. 400 (1913). 
    <P>
    <B>The purpose of requiring that legal notices be published in
    newspapers of general circulation is</B>not to benefit the
    papers but to insure that the public is aware of matters of
    legal importance. Resident Participation of Denver, Inc. v.
    Love, 322 F. Supp. 1100 (D. Colo. 1971).</P>
    <P>
    <B>And since the duty imposed by the notice requirement is a
    public one, its breach does not constitute a private
    wrong</B>for which a publisher can recover in an individual
    action. People ex rel. Lamar Publ'g Co. v. Hoag, 54 Colo. 542,
    131 P. 400 (1913).</P>
    <P>However, a printer who follows the statutory requirements as
    to printing the nomination list cannot be denied compensation
    for such printing by reason of his purported nonobservance of
    the clerk's directions to print in another form. Bd. of Comm'rs
    v. Frederick, 50 Colo. 464, 115 P. 514 (1911).</P>
    <P>
    <B>And for publishing the nomination list, publishers are
    entitled to the reasonable value of the work,</B>as §
    24-70-107, providing for fees for publication of legal notices,
    does not apply. Bd. of Comm'rs v. Price, 10 Colo. App. 519, 51
    P. 1011 (1898).</P>
    <P>
    <B>And a contract of the publisher of a newspaper for the legal
    printing</B>for a county may be so framed as to include the
    printing of such lists, in case the clerk should select such
    newspaper for its publication. Bd. of Comm'rs v. Frederick, 50
    Colo. 464, 115 P. 514 (1911).</P>
    <P>
    <B>But the publication of the list of nominations</B>is county
    printing. Bd. of Comm'rs v. Frederick, 50 Colo. 464, 115 P. 514
    (1911).</P>
    <P>
    <B>But inasmuch as the clerk is to select the newspaper</B>in
    which the list is to be published, a contract in general terms
    to do the "county legal printing", at a specified rate, does
    not include the publication of such lists. Bd. of Comm'rs v.

    <B>Annotator's note.</B>The following annotations include cases
    decided under former provisions similar to this section. 
    <P>
    <B>All provisions for the form of ballots are mandatory</B>in
    the sense that they impose a duty upon those who come within
    their terms. Allen v. Glynn, 17 Colo. 338, 29 P. 670
    (1892).</P>
    <P>
    <B>It does not follow, however, that an election should be
    invalidated because of every departure</B>on the part of public
    officers from the ballot arrangement requirements. Allen v.
    Glynn, 17 Colo. 338, 29 P. 670 (1892).</P>
    <P>
    <B>Rather, a ballot should be admitted if the spirit and
    intention of the requirements are not violated,</B>even though
    the ballot is not literally in accordance with them; for,
    unless a statute declares that a strict compliance with its
    requirements by the voters is essential to have their ballots
    counted, courts will not undertake to disfranchise them if, in
    the attempted exercise of their right, there is manifestly an
    effort to comply in good faith with the statutory requirements.
    Kellogg v. Hickman, 12 Colo. 256, 21 P. 325 (1888); Young v.
    Simpson, 21 Colo. 460, 42 P. 666 (1895); Nicholls v. Barrick,

    <AN-DIV>II.
    <M>USE OF PAPER BALLOTS.</M></AN-DIV>
    <ANNO-TEXT>
    <B>The legislative intent in prescribing the form, size, color
    of paper, etc., of ballots</B>to be used by voters is to guard
    the secrecy of the ballot and secure to the voter the right of
    suffrage, free of restraint. Kellogg v. Hickman, 12 Colo. 256,
    21 P. 325 (1888). 
    <P>
    <B>Thus, a ballot is not illegal merely because printed
    differently.</B>After a ballot has been voted, received, and
    counted, courts are not authorized, in the absence of
    constitutional restrictions as to the manner of exercising the
    right of suffrage, in declaring such ballot illegal merely
    because printed on paper of different quality, color, or
    dimension from that prescribed. Kellogg v. Hickman, 12 Colo.
    256, 21 P. 325 (1888).</P>
    <P>
    <B>Furthermore, objection to irregularities in printing of
    ballots is too late after the vote.</B>When public officers are
    entrusted with the preparation of ballots and ample provision
    is made for the correction of errors before an election, it is
    too late after they have been voted, as a general rule, to
    interpose objections to the ballots for mere irregularities in
    the printing thereof. Allen v. Glynn, 17 Colo. 338, 29 P. 670
    (1892).</P>
    <P>
    <B>And it cannot be held that a printer may not recover because
    of a disregard of the prescribed ballot arrangement,</B>or for
    a supposed nonobservance of the directions of the clerk, where,
    as matter of fact, the ballot list was published in the form
    contemplated, or at least permitted, by statutory requirements.
    Bd. of Comm'rs v. Frederick, 50 Colo. 464, 115 P. 514
    (1911).</P>
    <P>
    <B>But opposing candidate with notice of emblem mistake cannot
    lie by and allow voters to be misled.</B>If the county clerk
    makes a mistake in designating a candidate on the ballot as the
    nominee of a political party represented by an emblem, and the
    opposing candidate having notice of such mistake in time to
    have the mistake corrected, he will not be permitted to lie by
    and allow voters to be misled thereby and afterwards take
    advantage of such defect to defeat the expressed will of a
    majority of the voters. Allen v. Glynn, 17 Colo. 338, 29 P. 670

    <P>
    <B>But separate column for political designations
    required.</B>While the ballot arrangement requirements do not
    in specific terms provide for a separate column for political
    designations, a fair interpretation or construction thereof so
    requires, since opposite the name of each candidate must be
    added the party name, and this, in some cases at least, might

    <P>
    <B>The purpose of allowing the correction of errors</B>is to

    <P>
    <B>But it is the duty of candidates to make such objections in
    seasonable time,</B>since it would not be in the interest of a
    fair expression of the will of the people to allow a candidate
    to lie by and not point out such objections as he may have to

    Allen v. Glynn, 17 Colo. 338, 29 P. 670 (1892).</P>
    <P>
    <B>Moreover, the voter has no control whatever over the
    publication</B>of the names of candidates or the form of the
    ballots. If, for some defect in these particulars, the ballot
    must be rejected, the door would be open to fraud. Allen v.

    <B>Counties are required under subsection (1) of this section
    to assume the cost of providing drop-off boxes for mail-in
    ballots at every polling place on election day in compliance
    with § 1-8-113 (1)(a), notwithstanding that this increase in
    service may create additional costs to the
    county.</B>Subsection (1) and statute requiring state
    reimbursement to counties for costs associated with an
    increased level of service, § 29-1-304.5 (1), are in
    irreconcilable conflict. However, subsection (1), which
    pertains only to election funding, is more specific than the
    other statute, which broadly applies its reimbursement
    requirement to most existing state programs. Although §
    29-1-304.5 (1) was adopted after subsection (1), there is no
    manifest intent that it should prevail in a conflict with the
    other statute. Rather, the intent of the legislature was to
    prioritize citizens' access to free and fair elections over
    convenience or cost savings to counties. Thus, subsection (1)
    should prevail over § 29-1-304.5 (1), rendering § 29-1-304.5
    (1) inapplicable to the requirement that counties provide
    drop-off boxes for mail-in ballots at every polling place on
    election day under § 1-8-113 (1)(a). Gessler v. Doty, 2012 COA

  <N></N>(a)
  <M>The general assembly hereby finds and declares that, over the
  past decade, voting technology used in the state has undergone
  dramatic changes, creating confusion and difficulties for
  election administrators, state government, and the voting public.
  Efforts to address this confusion have been complicated by the
  timing of periodic substantial investments in voting technology
  by county governments necessitated by changes in federal and
  state law.</M>
  <P N="(1)(b)">(b)
  <M>Now, therefore, by enacting this section, the general assembly
  intends that:</M></P>
  <P N="(1)(b)(I)">(I)
  <M>Between May 15, 2009, and the 2014 general election, any
  voting system purchased by a political subdivision shall be a

  (23.5);</M></P>
  <P N="(1)(b)(II)">(II)
  <M>The acquisition of electronic voting systems be suspended in

  <M>Substantial investment by political subdivisions before the
  2014 general election in alternate technologies that will
  frustrate the intent of the general assembly as specified in
  paragraph (a) of this subsection (1) is discouraged and
  disfavored.</M></P>
  <P N="(2)">(2)
  <M>Notwithstanding any other provision of this part 6, any
  existing electronic voting device or any related component of the
  device that was used by a political subdivision in conducting the
  2008 general election may continue to be used by the political
  subdivision on and after May 15, 2009, as long as the device or
  component is used in accordance with either the conditions of use
  under which the device or component was originally certified for
  the 2008 general election or in accordance with alternate
  conditions of use established by the secretary of state.</M></P>
  <P N="(3)(a)">(3)
  <N></N>(a)
  <M>Notwithstanding any other provision of law, on and after May

  or system without obtaining the prior approval of the secretary
  of state for such purchase in accordance with the requirements of
  this subsection (3).</M></P>
  <P N="(3)(b)">(b)
  <M>Subject to the requirements of paragraph (a) of this
  subsection (3), if a political subdivision desires to purchase a
  new electronic voting device or system or any related component
  of such device or system, the political subdivision shall submit
  a written application to the secretary of state for approval of
  the purchase. The application shall be made by means of any forms
  or procedures established by the secretary. Within three business
  days of receiving the application, the secretary shall grant or
  deny the application. In reviewing the application, the secretary
  shall consider, among other relevant factors, the total effect of
  the purchase at issue in light of other purchases by the
  political subdivision on voting systems or components of such
  systems on or after May 15, 2009, and the needs of the political
  subdivision. In making the determination, the secretary shall
  prevent political subdivisions from making substantial
  investments in alternate technologies that will frustrate the
  intent of the general assembly as specified in subsection (1) of
  this section and shall consider, among other relevant
  factors:</M></P>
  <P N="(3)(b)(I)">(I)
  <M>Whether the purchase is intended to replace damaged or
  defective equipment or to accommodate an increase in population
  in the political subdivision;</M></P>
  <P N="(3)(b)(II)">(II)
  <M>Whether the purchase requires a new contract or agreement that
  would be entered into by the political subdivision and one or

  <P N="(3)(b)(III)">(III)
  <M>A comparison of the purchase under review with the average
  capital expenditures by the political subdivision on the
  administration of elections on an annual basis for the four
  consecutive years prior to the year in which the application is
  submitted in order to discourage an investment in technology with
  a limited useful life in accordance with the intent of the
  general assembly as specified in subsection (1) of this
  section.</M></P>
  <P N="(4)">(4)
  <M>The secretary of state shall promulgate rules in accordance
  with article 4 of title 24, C.R.S., as may be necessary to

  <M>The general assembly hereby finds and declares that:</M>
  <P N="(1)(a)">(a)
  <M>Congress enacted the language minority provisions of the
  federal "Voting Rights Act of 1965" because "through the use of
  various practices and procedures, citizens of language minorities
  have been effectively excluded from participation in the
  electoral process...";</M></P>
  <P N="(1)(b)">(b)
  <M>Today, the formula in section 203 of the "Voting Rights Act of
  1965" requires only the Colorado counties of Conejos, Costilla,
  Denver, and Saguache to provide election materials in both
  English and Spanish and requires one other Colorado county to
  provide information in Ute;</M></P>
  <P N="(1)(c)">(c)
  <M>Based on the 2017 five-year estimates specified in the United
  States bureau of the census American community survey, there are
  one hundred three thousand one hundred forty-six eligible
  electors in Colorado who speak English "less than very well". An
  estimated eighty-two thousand ninety-six of those eligible
  electors live in counties where ballots and other election
  materials are not available in languages other than
  English.</M></P>
  <P N="(1)(d)">(d)
  <M>Further compounding the problem of ballot access for minority
  language speakers is the reading level at which Colorado's
  ballots are written. For many minority language speakers the
  ballot is simply incomprehensible even if they speak and read
  some English.</M></P>
  <P N="(1)(e)">(e)
  <M>Section 203 of the "Voting Rights Act of 1965" covers a
  jurisdiction when the number of United States citizens of voting
  age in that jurisdiction has a single language group
  that:</M></P>
  <P N="(1)(e)(I)">(I)
  <M>Is more than ten thousand people of voting age, is more than
  five percent of all voting-age citizens, or is on an American
  Indian reservation and exceeds five percent of all reservation
  residents; and</M></P>
  <P N="(1)(e)(II)">(II)
  <M>The illiteracy rate of the group is higher than the national
  illiteracy rate;</M></P>
  <P N="(1)(f)">(f)
  <M>Colorado does not currently expand minority language ballot
  access beyond federal requirements; and</M></P>
  <P N="(1)(g)">(g)
  <M>Colorado has an opportunity to make the ballot accessible to

  a ballot that they are able to read, understand, and

  <P N="(2)">(2)
  <M>The general assembly further finds and declares that the
  intent of this part 9 is to:</M></P>
  <P N="(2)(a)">(a)
  <M>Provide ballot access to electors throughout the state while
  balancing the reality of limited state and county resources;
  and</M></P>

  <N></N>(a)
  <M>If more than one political subdivision holds an election on
  the same day in November and the eligible electors for each such
  election are the same or the boundaries overlap, the county clerk
  and recorder is the coordinated election official and, pursuant
  to section 1-5-401, shall conduct the elections on behalf of all
  political subdivisions whose elections are part of the
  coordinated election, utilizing the mail ballot procedure set
  forth in article 7.5 of this title. As used in this subsection
  (1), "political subdivision" includes the state, counties,
  municipalities, school districts, and special districts formed
  pursuant to title 32, C.R.S.</M>
  <P N="(1)(b)">(b)
  <M>Paragraph (a) of this subsection (1) does not apply to any
  political subdivision that conducts a mail ballot election or an
  independent mail ballot election, as defined in section
  1-13.5-1102, using mail ballot procedures set forth in article
  7.5 or 13.5 of this title or the "Colorado Municipal Election
  Code of 1965", article 10 of title 31, C.R.S., as appropriate. As
  used in this paragraph (b), "political subdivision" means a
  municipality as defined in section 31-1-101, C.R.S., or a special
  district as defined in section 1-13.5-103.</M></P>
  <P N="(1)(c)">(c)
  <M>A county clerk and recorder is not required to conduct any
  election using the procedures set forth in article 13.5 of this
  title.</M></P>
  <P N="(1)(d)">(d)
  <M>On and after January 1, 2023, a statutory city or town or home
  rule municipality may refer a municipal election using instant
  runoff voting to be conducted as part of a coordinated election
  in accordance with section 1-7-118. If required by section
  1-7-118, a county clerk and recorder shall conduct the election
  on behalf of the municipality as part of the coordinated election
  in accordance with this section and section 1-7-118. Failure to
  receive the notice required by section 1-7-118 in a timely manner

  <M>The political subdivisions for which the county clerk and

  an agreement with the county clerk and recorder for the county or

  election. The agreement shall include but not be limited to the
  following:</M></P>
  <P N="(2)(a)">(a)
  <M>Allocation of the responsibilities between the county clerk

  <M>Provision for a reasonable sharing of the actual cost of the

  maintaining the office of the county clerk and recorder,
  including but not limited to overhead costs and personal services
  costs of permanent employees, except for such costs that are
  shown to be directly attributable to conducting coordinated
  elections on behalf of political subdivisions. Notwithstanding
  any other provision of this section, the state's share of the
  actual costs of the coordinated election shall be governed by the
  provisions of section 1-5-505.5. Where the state's reimbursement
  to a particular county for the costs of conducting a coordinated
  election pursuant to section 1-5-505.5 is less than the costs of
  conducting a coordinated election for which the county is
  entitled to reimbursement by means of a cost-sharing agreement
  entered into pursuant to the provisions of this subsection (2),
  such differential shall be assumed by the county. Where the
  state's reimbursement to a particular county for the costs of
  conducting a coordinated election pursuant to section 1-5-505.5
  is greater than the costs of conducting a coordinated election
  for which the county is entitled to reimbursement by means of a
  cost-sharing agreement entered into pursuant to the provisions of
  this subsection (2), the county shall be entitled to retain such
  differential, with no obligation to return any portion of such
  amount to the state.</M></P>

  <P N="(3)">(3)
  <M>Notwithstanding the provision for independent mail ballot
  elections in subsection (1) of this section, the ballot issue
  notice shall be prepared and mailed in substantial compliance
  with part 9 of this article 7, and the preparation and mailing
  thereof shall be made pursuant to an agreement as provided in

    <P>
    <B>Ballot not rejected if choice can be gathered.</B>Unless the
    statute declares that a strict compliance with its requirements
    by the elector is essential to have his ballot counted, courts
    will not undertake to disfranchise him by rejecting his ballot
    where his choice can be gathered from the ballot viewed in the
    light of the circumstances surrounding the election. Young v.
    Simpson, 21 Colo. 460, 42 P. 666 (1895).</P>
    <P>
    <B>As where cross mark is before candidates's name.</B>Where a
    ballot has no mark opposite any party emblem, but is marked
    with a cross mark to the left and before the candidate's name,
    it should be counted, although the customary and better
    practice is to put the cross mark to the right of the name of
    the candidate intended to be voted for. Young v. Simpson, 21
    Colo. 460, 42 P. 666 (1895).</P>
    <P>
    <B>Or slightly to the right of the appropriate square.</B>Where
    a voter designates his choice by placing a cross mark not in
    the space prepared for the purpose, but slightly to the right
    of the square opposite it, the ballot is properly counted.
    Young v. Simpson, 21 Colo. 460, 42 P. 666 (1895).</P>
    <P>
    <B>Similarly, a ballot should be counted if intent can be
    ascertained with reasonable certainty.</B>A ballot cast by a
    qualified elector, at an election held according to law and at
    the time and place provided by law, should be counted if the
    intent of the voter can be ascertained with reasonable
    certainty, unless this is forbidden by some positive provision
    of statute. Baldwin v. Wade, 50 Colo. 109, 114 P. 399
    (1911).</P>
    <P>
    <B>As where name is written in under printed name.</B>In the
    official ballot of a municipal election the name of A was
    printed as a candidate; below this, and in the same space, the
    voter wrote the name of B; and in the space left for this
    purpose, he placed a cross mark, the intersection of which was
    not directly opposite either name. Considering that the voter,
    if he desired to vote for A, had no occasion to insert the name
    of B, it was held that the ballot must be counted for B.
    Baldwin v. Wade, 50 Colo. 109, 114 P. 399 (1911).</P>
    <P>
    <B>Or above an obliterated printed name.</B>Where a voter
    obliterates a printed name with ink and writes in a name above
    it, placing a cross mark at the right, the ballot should be
    counted. Baldwin v. Wade, 50 Colo. 109, 114 P. 399 (1911).</P>
    <P>
    <B>Nevertheless, an elector, in order to properly express his
    choice, must do so substantially in the manner provided</B>by
    statute. Young v. Simpson, 21 Colo. 460, 42 P. 666 (1895);
    Heiskell v. Landrum, 23 Colo. 65, 46 P. 120 (1896); Rhode v.
    Steinmetz, 25 Colo. 308, 55 P. 814 (1898); Wiley v. McDowell,
    55 Colo. 236, 133 P. 757 (1913); Bromley v. Hallock, 57 Colo.
    148, 140 P. 186 (1914).</P>
    <P>
    <B>Thus a voter must express his choice by making a "X"
    opposite candidate's name.</B>Riley v. Trainor, 57 Colo. 155,
    140 P. 469 (1914).</P>
    <P>
    <B>Likewise, voters must make cross marks when they write in
    more than one name.</B>Where there are several candidates for
    an office and voters write in the spaces left for this purpose,
    under the word indicating the office, the names of those
    persons, among them the name of the contestor but no cross mark
    set opposite the contestor's name upon any of these ballots,
    they are not to be counted for the contestor. Riley v. Trainor,
    57 Colo. 155, 140 P. 469 (1914).</P>
    <P>
    <B>An indelible pencil may be used.</B>Where a ballot is in
    perfect form, but the name of the person voted for and the
    cross marks are written with an indelible pencil, it should be
    counted. Baldwin v. Wade, 50 Colo. 109, 114 P. 399 (1911).</P>
    <P>
    <B>A voter prohibited from marking more names on a ballot than
    there are persons to be elected to an office cannot be
    construed to prohibit only the double marking of eligible
    candidates for such office.</B>Moran v. Carlstrom, 775 P.2d
    1176 (Colo. 1989).</P>
    <P>
    <B>This section and § 1-4-1001 (now § 1-4-1101) do not

    rejects ballots showing more names than persons to be elected
    to an office whereas § 1-4-1001 (now § 1-4-1101) regulates the
    conduct of write-in candidates and prohibits the write-in
    candidate who fails to file an affidavit of intent from

  voting system, and all of the voting system's input, output, and
  communication devices are working properly.</M>
  <P N="(1)(b)">(b)
  <M>The designated election official shall conduct at least three
  tests on all electronic and electromagnetic voting equipment,
  including a hardware test, a public logic and accuracy test
  conducted in accordance with subsection (2) of this section, and
  a postelection test or audit conducted in accordance with rules
  promulgated by the secretary of state. Each type of ballot,
  including mail, provisional, and audio ballots, shall be tested
  in accordance with rules promulgated by the secretary of state.
  The tests must ensure that the equipment will correctly count the
  votes cast for all offices and on all ballot questions and ballot
  issues and that the voting system will accurately count ballots
  of all types.</M></P>

  <N></N>(a)
  <M>A public test of voting equipment shall be conducted prior to
  the commencement of voting in accordance with this section by
  processing a preaudited group of ballots produced so as to record
  a predetermined number of valid votes for each candidate and on
  each ballot question or ballot issue. The test shall ensure that
  the system accurately records votes when the elector has the
  option of voting for more than one candidate in a race. The test
  shall ensure that the voting system properly rejects and does not
  count overvotes and undervotes. If the equipment is to be used in
  an election using instant runoff voting, the test shall ensure
  that the voting system accurately records, counts, and tabulates
  an elector's rankings of multiple candidates in accordance with
  section 1-7-1003 and rules promulgated by the secretary of
  state.</M></P>
  <P N="(2)(b)">(b)
  <M>The public test shall be open to representatives of the

  subsection (6) of this section. Each major political party, minor
  political party, ballot issue committee that has an issue on the
  ballot, and coordinating entity may designate one person, who
  shall be allowed to witness all public tests and the counting of
  pretest votes. If an observer or designee hinders or disturbs the
  test process, the designated election official may remove the
  person from the test area. An observer or designee who has been
  removed from a public test may be barred from future tests. The
  absence of observers or designees shall not delay or stop the
  public test.</M></P>
  <P N="(2)(c)">(c)
  <M>The testing board shall convene and designate at least one
  member to represent the board during the testing, sign the
  necessary reports, and report to the board. The programs and
  ballots used for testing shall be attested to and sealed by the

  test may take place and the manner in which members of the public
  may obtain specific information about the time and place of the
  test. Nothing in this subsection (3) shall preclude the use of
  additional methods of providing information about the public test
  to members of the public.</M></P>
  <P N="(4)(a)">(4)
  <N></N>(a)
  <M>If any tested device is found to have an error in tabulation,
  it shall be deemed unsatisfactory. For each device deemed
  unsatisfactory, the testing board shall attempt to determine the
  cause of the error, attempt to identify and test other devices
  that could reasonably be expected to have the same error, and
  test a number of additional devices sufficient to determine that
  all other devices are satisfactory. The cause of any error
  detected shall be corrected, and an errorless count shall be made
  before the voting equipment is approved. The test shall be
  repeated and errorless results achieved before official ballots
  are counted.</M></P>
  <P N="(4)(b)">(b)
  <M>If an error is detected in the operation or output of an

  error.</M></P>
  <P N="(4)(c)">(c)
  <M>A voting device deemed unsatisfactory shall be recoded,
  repaired, or replaced and shall be made available for retesting
  unless a sufficient number of tested backup devices is available
  to replace the unsatisfactory device. The backup device may not
  be used in the election unless the testing board or its
  representative determines that the device is satisfactory. The
  designated election official shall announce at the conclusion of
  the first testing the date, place, and time that an
  unsatisfactory device will be retested, or, at the option of the
  testing board, the designated election official shall notify by
  telephone each person who was present at the first testing of the
  date, place, and time of the retesting.</M></P>
  <P N="(5)">(5)
  <M>The designated election official shall keep records of all
  previous testing of electronic and electromechanical tabulation
  devices used in any election. Such records shall be available for
  inspection and reference during public testing by any person in
  attendance. The need of the testing board for access to such
  records during the testing shall take precedence over the need of
  other attendees for access so that the work of the testing board
  will not be hindered. Records of testing shall include, for each
  device, the name of the person who tested the device and the
  date, place, time, and results of each test. Records of testing
  shall be retained as part of the official records of the election
  in which the device is used.</M></P>
  <P N="(6)">(6)
  <M>The secretary of state shall promulgate rules in accordance
  with article 4 of title 24 prescribing the manner of performing
  the logic and accuracy testing required by this section. On or

    <P>
    <B>The judges are required to make a certificate in such form
    that it could not be changed except</B>it would show evidence
    of having been tampered with. People ex rel. Miller v. Tool, 35

    <P>
    <B>Therefore, tally sheets are insufficient to contradict
    certificates.</B>In the face of this section it certainly was
    not the purpose of the general assembly to allow mere tally
    sheets, which are not certified, contain nothing more than
    strokes of pen or pencil with respect to the number of votes
    cast for any candidate, and can be readily changed, to be taken
    as evidence sufficient to contradict the certificates in case
    of a discrepancy between such certificates and the tally
    sheets. People ex rel. Miller v. Tool, 35 Colo. 225, 86 P. 224,
    86 P. 229, 86 P. 231 (1905).</P>
    <P>
    <B>Furthermore, irregularities committed by judges of election
    in the certification of their returns do not invalidate the
    returns</B>unless they are in such a state as to render it
    impossible to ascertain therefrom the vote and for whom cast.
    Lehman v. Pettingell, 39 Colo. 258, 89 P. 48 (1907).</P>
    <P>
    <B>And such returns must be canvassed and certified</B>by the
    canvassing board. Lehman v. Pettingell, 39 Colo. 258, 89 P. 48
    (1907).</P>
    <P>
    <B>Hence, where the judges did not receive the pollbooks
    required in time for use on election day and thereupon kept a
    list</B>of the voters and made a tally of the votes on sample
    ballots, and the judges, after certifying to the result of the
    election, although not in the manner and form prescribed,
    delivered the returns to the county clerk within a few days
    after election, but the board of canvassers refused to count
    and canvass said returns, although no other returns were
    received from that precinct, solely because the certificates
    and oaths were not in the form and the returns upon the proper
    blanks, such irregularities did not invalidate the returns, and
    it further appearing that the precinct judges in good faith
    undertook to certify the true result of the precinct election
    and that the result could be ascertained therefrom, it became
    the duty of the board to canvass such returns and to issue
    certificates in accordance with the result. Lehman v.
    Pettingell, 39 Colo. 258, 80 P. 48 (1907).</P>
    <P>
    <B>Injunction lies to prevent judges of election from

  <COMMENT-HEAD>PREFATORY NOTE</COMMENT-HEAD>
  <COMMENT-TEXT>Over five million military personnel and overseas
  civilians face a variety of legal and logistical obstacles to
  participating in American elections. These problems persist
  notwithstanding repeated congressional efforts, as well as
  various state efforts, to facilitate these voters' ability to
  vote, most prominently the enactment of the Uniformed and
  Overseas Citizens Absentee Voting Act of 1986 (UOCAVA), and its
  amendment with the Military and Overseas Voter Empowerment Act of
  2009 (MOVE). The obstacles include: difficulties in registering
  to vote from abroad; ballots or ballot applications that never
  arrive; frequent changes of address; slow mail delivery times to
  and from overseas citizens, especially military personnel;
  failures to complete absentee voting materials properly,
  including noncompliance with notarization or verification
  requirements that can be difficult to meet abroad; and
  difficulties in obtaining information about issues and
  candidates. 
  <P>Data from the 2006 federal midterm election provide dramatic
  evidence of the problems that these voters have recently faced.
  In 2006 U.S. military personnel were slightly more likely to have
  registered to vote than the general U.S. population (87% vs.
  83%), yet the voter participation rate among the military was
  about half that of the general population (roughly 20% vs.
  roughly 40%). Furthermore, only 25% of overseas and military
  voters who requested an absentee ballot in 2006 completed and
  returned one, compared to 85% of all voters who requested an
  absentee ballot. Meanwhile, more than one in five ballots cast by
  military service members was rejected.</P>
  <P>Although some of these figures improved during the
  high-interest 2008 presidential election, the overall picture
  remains troubling. In 2008, roughly two-thirds of those overseas
  and military voters who requested a ballot returned it, and the
  rejection rate for those ballots dropped to under one in fifteen
  ballots. Yet both of these rates remain substantially worse than
  the comparable 2008 rates for absentee voters generally (which
  were a return rate of over 90%, and a ballot rejection rate of
  1.7%). Meanwhile, according to data collected by the U.S.
  Election Assistance Commission, fewer than 700,000 absentee
  ballots were returned by military and overseas voters in 2008.
  This figure is not much different from the comparable figure for
  the 2006 federal midterm elections, meaning that the voter
  participation rate among these voters remained well below 20%,
  despite the fact that among voters generally the 2008 election
  produced an overall voter participation rate of over 61%, the
  largest in four decades. Without additional reforms to the voting
  processes for military and overseas voters, their ability to
  participate in American elections likely will continue to
  suffer.</P>
  <P>Strong popular support exists among the American public to
  make voting much easier and more reliable for these voters than
  it has been. A 2008 public opinion survey conducted for the Pew
  Center on the States found "strong universal support . . . across
  age, regional, and party lines" for the idea that military and
  overseas voters should be able to participate in elections "back
  home." A variety of stakeholders who participated in the ULC
  drafting process for this act were overwhelmingly of a similar
  disposition.</P>
  <P>In important part, the obstacles that overseas and military
  voters face can be traced to the fact that American elections are
  conducted at the state and local levels under procedures that
  often vary dramatically by jurisdiction. This lack of uniformity
  complicates any federal effort, such as the UOCAVA, to assist
  these voters to surmount the other major obstacles that they
  face. For instance, while some states permit overseas absentee
  ballots to arrive up to ten days after Election Day, other states
  require that all absentee ballots, including those from overseas,
  be received by Election Day. Meanwhile, some states permit
  overseas and military voters to request, and in a smaller number
  of cases also to cast, an absentee ballot electronically, but
  other states require transmission by regular mail. Some states
  require a notary or other witness to vouch for the absentee
  voter's execution of the absentee ballot affirmation. These and
  other variations across states both complicate the procedures
  developed under the UOCAVA to help overseas and military voters,
  and make it difficult for consular officials, the U.S. military,
  and non-governmental voting assistance groups to give standard
  advice to these voters.</P>
  <P>In confronting these problems, this act has two independent
  purposes that can only be achieved through uniform state
  legislation. The first is to extend to state elections the
  assistance and protections for military and overseas voters
  currently found in federal law, which covers only biennial
  federal elections. The second is to bring greater uniformity to
  the military and overseas voting processes, which the several
  states will continue to have primary responsibility for
  administering, in both federal and non-federal elections. In
  addition to these two primary purposes, many provisions of the
  act also enhance the assistance and protections provided to
  military and overseas voters, wherever this can be done without
  compromising the integrity of the voting process or imposing
  inappropriately on election officials.</P>
  <P>Critical to both enhancing and bringing uniformity to the
  voting process for military and overseas voters is establishing
  adequate time for this group of voters to request, receive, and
  return a ballot. Directly related to the amount of time needed to
  accomplish these voting processes is the extent to which
  electronic transmission mechanisms are employed. The act requires
  that electronic transmission methods be available for purposes of
  requesting and receiving unvoted ballots, but does not require
  the use of electronic means for transmitting voted ballots. This
  is because no consensus yet exists on the question of whether and
  how electronic voting can occur securely and privately. However,
  using electronic transmission methods for just those steps in the
  absentee voting process prior to the casting of a ballot (such as
  registering to vote, requesting an absentee ballot, and receiving
  a blank ballot) can alone dramatically reduce the time required
  to permit these voters to vote successfully.</P>
  <P>Without uniform state legislation, military and overseas
  voters will continue to confront a panoply of diverging voting
  requirements, notwithstanding the important role that UOCAVA has
  played in facilitating military and overseas voting in federal
  elections for more than two decades, and the additional
  enhancements that the MOVE Act of 2009 provides. Accordingly,
  this act should be widely adopted both to simplify the voting
  process for these voters, and to extend similar protections to
  state elections not covered by existing federal
  law.</P></COMMENT-TEXT>

  </COMMENT-HEAD>
  <COMMENT-TEXT>The act's definition of the term "covered voter"
  builds upon the definitions of "absent uniformed service voter"
  and "overseas voter" in the Uniformed and Overseas Citizens
  Absentee Voting Act ("UOCAVA"), 42 U.S.C. § 1973ff-6(1), but
  simplifies these definitions and expands them to cover members of
  the National Guard. However, unlike in the UOCAVA, the act's
  coverage of uniformed service voters is based on a voter's status
  as an active member of one of the defined services, whether or
  not the voter is absent from the place of voting. The definition
  of "uniformed service voter" does not specify that the place
  where the voter is qualified to vote be in the enacting state
  because that would create a problem for a spouse (or dependent)
  who is eligible to vote in this state but whose uniformed service
  member is eligible in another state. A uniformed service voter
  still must meet an enacting state's eligibility requirements
  (including residency in that state) in order to vote in that
  state. 
  <P>The definition of "covered voter," in subsection (2), also
  extends the act's coverage to U.S. citizens born abroad who have
  not established a voting residency in the United States. Although
  UOCAVA makes no provision for these citizens, eighteen states
  already permit these citizens to participate in at least some
  elections, if their parents are eligible to vote in that state
  (or in some cases if they are a spouse or dependent of a person
  eligible to vote in that state). These states include: Arizona,
  Colorado (federal offices only), Delaware (federal offices only),
  Georgia, Hawaii, Illinois, Iowa, Massachusetts, Michigan,
  Nebraska, New York (federal offices only), North Dakota (federal
  offices only), Oklahoma, Rhode Island (federal offices only),
  Tennessee, Washington, West Virginia, and Wisconsin (federal
  offices only).</P>
  <P>The definition makes no distinction between overseas voters
  merely traveling abroad, voters temporarily living overseas, and
  voters permanently residing overseas. Other provisions of an
  enacting state's existing law may do so, however, and may limit
  the elections in which voters permanently overseas can vote.
  Without such distinctions elsewhere in existing state law, this
  act would enable all overseas voters to vote in all elections
  covered in section 1-8.3-103. Because the act does not require
  that overseas voters "reside" abroad, it facilitates voting by a
  wide variety of U.S. citizens, including missionaries, students
  abroad, and even tourists who because of health or other
  unanticipated problems or events may have extended their time out
  of the United States beyond their original plans, but for whom a
  state's regular absentee balloting process may be difficult to
  use.</P></COMMENT-TEXT>

  </COMMENT-HEAD>
  <COMMENT-TEXT>Each state will need to supply the appropriate
  title for its chief elections authority, whether it is the
  Secretary of State, head or director of the State Board of
  Elections, or other official or entity. Where this authority is
  an organization, rather than an individual, the phrase "state
  official" in subsection (1) may also merit alternative phrasing.
  The expectation is that this authority in turn will delegate its
  duties at least in part to the same office that the state has
  designated to fulfill the UOCAVA requirement that the state
  designate a state office to facilitate the state's compliance
  with the UOCAVA. Other duties may naturally devolve to local
  election officials, depending on how the state has structured its
  election processes generally. 
  <P>In most states, the implementing authority specified in
  subsection (1) presumably already has authority to promulgate
  rules according to the existing rulemaking procedures of the
  state. States in which this rulemaking authority is not already
  established may wish to include additional language establishing
  authority to make rules to implement this act.</P>
  <P>The requirement that states develop "standardized" voting
  materials is not meant to require statewide uniformity in voting
  equipment and processes where such uniformity does not already
  exist. Thus, in states using different voting systems in
  different jurisdictions around the state, "standardized" voting
  materials may include one standard for jurisdictions using one
  system, and another standard for jurisdictions using another
  system. Nevertheless, the state's chief elections authority
  should work with local election officials to simplify and
  standardize as much as possible the materials provided to voters,
  including developing standard identifying labels and other
  markings on such materials to expedite their handling. Such
  standardization is critical primarily because it will simplify
  the voting experiences of covered voters and enable a variety of
  support groups to provide more effective assistance to these
  voters as a group. Greater uniformity also should ease
  administrative duties and facilitate future reforms to the voting
  process.</P>
  <P>The "electronic equivalent" of privacy envelopes and
  transmission envelopes means at a minimum a template or
  instructions to accompany the electronic delivery of an unvoted
  ballot that assist the voter to prepare and use appropriate
  envelopes to return the voter's marked ballot if the voter is
  returning the ballot physically through the mail. If a state is
  allowing a voter to return a marked ballot electronically, the
  state generally should employ digital encryption or other
  security measures to provide comparable protection of the
  integrity and secrecy of the marked ballot.</P>
  <P>The electronic transmission method established under
  subsection (3) should be designed to protect the integrity of the
  transmission and the privacy of the voter's personal data
  contained in the transmission. To a similar end, the recent
  amendments to UOCAVA include provisions requiring that "to the
  extent practicable," electronic transmission methods "shall
  ensure that the privacy of the identity and other personal data
  of an absent uniformed services voter or overseas voter is
  protected" and also shall "protect the security and integrity of
  the transmission."</P></COMMENT-TEXT>

  <COMMENT-TEXT>The language in subsection (2) is intended to
  capture the deadline for the event when local election officials
  complete or certify their official counting of ballots, by
  whatever name that event is known in the state. Even those
  ballots of overseas and military voters that arrive after
  election day can and must be included in these official results
  if local election officials have received them by the day before
  the deadline for this event, giving local election officials that
  day to process them before making their return or certification. 
  <P>The act precludes rejecting a military-overseas ballot for
  lack of a postmark (or for a late postmark) in light of the fact
  that many pieces of military mail enter the postal system through
  delivery to a mail clerk in a remote location without a postmark,
  and are only postmarked some days later when they reach a more
  established facility.</P></COMMENT-TEXT>

  <M>The local election official shall request an electronic-mail

  13, 2011. An electronic-mail address provided by a covered voter
  shall not be made available to the public or any individual or

  24, C.R.S. The address may be used only for official

  requested electronic transmission, and verifying the voter's
  mailing address and physical location. The request for an

  </COMMENT-HEAD>
  <COMMENT-TEXT>Subsection (1) facilitates the collection of voter
  e-mail addresses, but depends on assuring voters that their
  e-mail addresses will not become available for the use of
  political campaigns and marketers. The subsection allows those
  jurisdictions that use third-party vendors to print, mail, or
  otherwise distribute ballots to disclose the e-mail addresses to
  these vendors, acting as their agents, only for purposes of
  authorized communications about the voting process. Such
  jurisdictions should ensure that their vendor contracts properly
  preclude the vendors from using the addresses other than as
  authorized by this act. Subsection (2) then ties a voter's
  ability to make a standing request for a military-absentee ballot
  to the voter's provision of an e-mail address. This approach is
  intended to reduce the large quantity of election material that
  was returned as undeliverable when sent out in hardcopy to an
  outdated physical address under the now repealed UOCAVA provision
  that had permitted voters to make a standing request for absentee
  ballots for two federal election cycles.</COMMENT-TEXT>

  <M>Challenge of illegal or fraudulent
  registration.</M></CATCH-LINE>(1)
  <N></N>(a)
  <M>Any registered elector may, by written challenge, protest
  against the registration of any person whose name appears in a
  county registration record. The written challenge shall state the
  precinct number, the name of the challenged registrant, the basis
  for such challenge, the facts supporting the challenge, and some
  documentary evidence to support the basis for the challenge, and
  shall bear the signature and address of the challenger. The
  written challenge and supporting evidence shall be filed with the
  county clerk and recorder no later than sixty days before any
  election. The county clerk and recorder shall notify the
  registrant of the challenge and shall set a time and place for a
  hearing to be held not later than thirty days after the filing of
  the challenge, at which hearing the challenged registrant shall
  have the opportunity to appear. The person challenging the
  registration shall appear and shall bear the burden of proof of
  the allegations in the challenge. The county clerk and recorder
  shall conduct the hearing and receive testimony and evidence,
  shall render a decision in accordance with paragraph (b) of this
  subsection (1) no later than five days thereafter, and shall
  notify both parties of the decision.</M>
  <P N="(1)(b)">(b)
  <M>In rendering a decision, the county clerk and recorder has the
  following options:</M></P>
  <P N="(1)(b)(I)">(I)
  <M>If the county clerk and recorder finds sufficient evidence to
  support the allegations in the challenge, he or she shall cancel
  the registered elector's name from the statewide voter
  registration system; or</M></P>
  <P N="(1)(b)(II)">(II)
  <M>(Deleted by amendment, L. 2013.)</M></P>
  <P N="(1)(b)(III)">(III)
  <M>If the county clerk and recorder finds no evidence or
  insufficient evidence to support the allegations in the
  challenge, he or she shall deny the challenge to cancel the
  registered elector's name from the statewide voter registration
  system.</M></P>
  <P N="(2)">(2)
  <M>All appeals from the decision of the county clerk and recorder
  shall be to the district court within three days after the
  decision is issued. The appellant shall file in the district
  court a verified petition setting forth the facts presented at
  the hearing, the decision of the county clerk and recorder, and
  the basis for the appeal. Within twenty-four hours, the clerk of
  the district court shall mail to the other party a notice of the
  appeal and the time set for hearing, which shall be not less than
  three days nor more than five days after the date of
  filing.</M></P>
  <P N="(3)">(3)
  <M>The court shall hear the testimony and other evidence and
  investigate summarily and, within forty-eight hours after the
  close of the evidence, determine whether or not the charges are
  sustained. Only competent legal evidence may be received at the
  hearing or considered by the court, and no name registered in
  accordance with law shall be canceled from the statewide voter
  registration system unless it is proven that the challenged
  person does not reside at the address provided by the person at
  the time of registration. No presumption may be made against any
  person whose registration is challenged merely because of the
  failure of that person to attend the hearing. The court has the
  power to subpoena any person as a witness at the hearing and make
  any necessary investigation to ascertain the truth of any of the
  charges in the petition if the method of the investigation does
  not cause unnecessary delay or interfere with the final
  disposition of the cause within the time provided for in this
  section. The hearing on any petition is summary and final and is
  not subject to delay. At the close of the hearing, the court
  shall announce the names in the petition as to which the charges
  have been sustained and shall direct the clerk of the court to
  certify forthwith to the county clerk and recorder the lists of
  names of those persons, with their addresses, arranged
  alphabetically and according to precinct. The county clerk and
  recorder, upon receipt of the list from the court, shall
  forthwith cancel those names from the statewide voter
  registration system for the proper precinct with the notation
  that the names were canceled pursuant to court order, giving the
  date of the order. The decision of the court is final, and no
  appeal lies to any other court; except that the supreme court, in
  the exercise of its discretion, may review any such proceedings
  in a summary way.</M></P></SECTION-TEXT>

  chairperson of the political party to which the appointee
  belongs. The county chairperson shall forthwith appoint another

  determination unless evidence exists that the integrity of the
  voter-verified paper records has been irrevocably compromised.
  The secretary of state shall decide which method of recount is

  ballot question or ballot issue that did not pass at the election
  or opposed a ballot question or ballot issue that passed at the
  election.</M>
  <P N="(2)">(2)
  <M>Whenever a recount is not required, an interested party may
  submit a notarized written request for a recount at the expense
  of the interested party making the request. This request shall be
  filed with the secretary of state, the county clerk and recorder,
  the designated election official, or other governing body that
  originally certified the candidate, ballot question, or ballot
  issue for the ballot within twenty-eight days after any primary,
  general, or coordinated election. Such election official shall
  notify the political subdivision within which the election was
  held no later than the day following receipt of the request.
  Before conducting the recount, the election official who will
  conduct the recount shall determine the cost of the recount
  within one day of receiving the request to recount, notify the
  interested party that requested the recount of the cost, and
  collect the costs of conducting the recount. If the request is
  filed with the secretary of state, the secretary of state shall
  determine the cost of the recount by adding the individual
  amounts determined by the political subdivisions conducting the
  recount. The interested party that requested the recount shall
  pay the cost of the recount by certified funds to the election
  official with whom the request for a recount was filed within one
  day of receiving the election official's cost determination. The
  funds shall be placed in escrow for payment of all expenses
  incurred in the recount. If after the recount the result of the
  election is reversed in favor of the interested party that
  requested the recount or if the amended election count is such
  that a recount otherwise would have been required, the payment
  for expenses shall be refunded to the interested party that
  requested the recount. Any escrow amounts not refunded to the
  interested party that requested the recount shall be paid to the
  election officials who conducted the recount. Any recount of
  votes pursuant to this section shall be completed no later than
  the thirty-seventh day after any primary, general, or coordinated
  election.</M></P></SECTION-TEXT>

    <AN-SUB>A.
    <M>In General.</M></AN-SUB>
    <ANNO-TEXT>
    <B>In an election contest, the statement of contest must bring
    the case within one of the enumerated causes</B>constituting
    grounds for contest. Lewis v. Boynton, 25 Colo. 486, 55 P. 732
    (1898). 
    <P>
    <B>For, in an election contest, the contestor should be able to
    show some good reason</B>for the contest. Todd v. Stewart, 14
    Colo. 286, 23 P. 426 (1890); Smith v. Harris, 18 Colo. 274, 32
    P. 616 (1893); Boger v. Smith, 77 Colo. 475, 238 P. 57
    (1925).</P>
    <P>
    <B>And in the absence of some definite and specific assertion,
    a court will assume that there are none</B>to be made. Todd v.
    Stewart, 14 Colo. 286, 23 P. 426 (1890); Smith v. Harris, 18
    Colo. 274, 32 P. 616 (1893); Boger v. Smith, 77 Colo. 475, 238
    P. 57 (1925).</P>
    <P>
    <B>Moreover, a statement of contest not vulnerable to demurrer
    (now dismissal for failure to state a claim) may be assailable
    on other grounds,</B>e.g., that it is ambiguous,
    unintelligible, and uncertain. Collins v. Heath, 76 Colo. 600,
    233 P. 838 (1925); Boger v. Smith, 77 Colo. 475, 238 P. 57
    (1925).</P>
    <P>
    <B>And contestors are without right to amend their statement of
    contest</B>by supplying the very thing which was essential in
    the first instance to state a ground of contest and give the
    court jurisdiction. Town of Sugar City v. Bd. of Comm'rs, 57
    Colo. 432, 140 P. 809 (1914).</P>
    <P>
    <B>Causes of contest incorporated by reference.</B>The causes
    of contest are, insofar as applicable, incorporated by
    reference into provisions requiring a contestor of the election
    of county officers to file a written statement setting forth,
    among other things, the causes of the contest, and hence also
    into provisions relating to contests in special district
    elections. Jardon v. Meadowbrook-Fairview Metro. Dist., 190

    <B>Eligibility is to be determined at the date of
    qualifying.</B>Cox v. Starkweather, 128 Colo. 89, 260 P.2d 587
    (1953). 
    <P>
    <B>And the word "eligible" has reference to</B>the capacity not
    of being elected to office, but of holding office. Cox v.
    Starkweather, 128 Colo. 89, 260 P.2d 587 (1953).</P>
    <P>
    <B>Thus it is wholly immaterial whether contestee is qualified
    at the time of election</B>when at the time of taking office
    his eligibility exists. Cox v. Starkweather, 128 Colo. 89, 260
    P.2d 587 (1953).</P>
    <P>
    <B>For the eligibility of a candidate to office is to be
    ascertained as of the time of his entering upon the
    duties</B>of the office. Cox v. Starkweather, 128 Colo. 89, 260
    P.2d 587 (1953).</P>
    <P>
    <B>Election is contested under subsection (1)(a)</B>when
    candidate in nonpartisan election did not meet the residency
    requirement to serve the position. Figueroa v. Speers, 2015 CO
    12, 343 P.3d 967.</P>
    <P>
    <B>An election will not be set aside for irregularities unless
    they affect the result</B>of the election. People v. Keeling, 4
    Colo. 129 (1878); Kellogg v. Hickman, 12 Colo. 256, 21 P. 325
    (1888); Todd v. Stewart, 14 Colo. 286, 23 P. 426 (1890); Allen

    Colo. 238, 94 P. 294 (1908); Littlejohn v. People, 52 Colo.
    217, 121 P. 159 (1912); City of Loveland v. Western Light &amp;
    Power Co., 65 Colo. 55, 173 P. 717 (1918); Suttle v. Sullivan,
    131 Colo. 519, 283 P.2d 636 (1955).</P>
    <P>
    <B>The causes for contest make no provision for a contest of an
    election upon the removal of a county seat,</B>for the only
    election contests authorized are those of officers.
    Accordingly, it is also clear that there is no remedy by quo
    warranto, for that remedy is only employed to test the right of
    an officer or franchise. People v. Bd. of County Comm'rs, 6
    Colo. 202 (1882).</P>
    <P>
    <B>Similarly, failure of election officials to issue absentee
    ballots upon oral application,</B>although they had previously
    promised to do so, amounts to nothing as a ground of contest.
    Graham v. Swift, 123 Colo. 309, 228 P.2d 969 (1951).</P>
    <P>
    <B>And an allegation that the name of the contestee was
    unlawfully printed</B>upon the official ballot under the name
    and emblem of a political party of which he was not the
    nominee, that the filing of the certificate of nomination of
    contestee as the nominee of such political party was the result
    of a fraudulent conspiracy between contestee and the county
    clerk, and that by reason of having his name so printed under
    the name and emblem of the said political party he had counted
    for him a large number of votes to which he was not entitled,
    sufficient to reduce the number of his votes below the number
    cast for contestor, does not state a cause for contest under
    this section. Rather, it was contestor's duty to make his
    objection to the printing of contestee's name on the official
    ballot under the name and emblem to which he was not entitled
    in seasonable time and in the manner provided by the election
    law, and failing to do so, he cannot be heard after election to
    urge such objections when to uphold them would be to overthrow
    the expressed will of a majority of the legal voters of the
    county. Lewis v. Boynton, 25 Colo. 486, 55 P. 732

    <B>Provision conflicts with U.S. constitution as to

    provision which purports to vest the Colorado supreme court
    with jurisdiction to try election contests arising out of a
    primary election for nomination to the United States Senate and
    House of Representatives conflicts with article I, section
    5(1), of the United States Constitution, allowing each house to
    "be the judge of the elections, returns, and qualifications of
    its own member", and in such situation the United States
    Constitution must prevail: Inasmuch as the authority given
    Congress by article I, section 4(1), of the United States
    Constitution to regulate elections for senators and
    representatives includes the authority to regulate primary
    elections where, under the law of the state, they are an
    integral part of the procedure for the choice of
    representatives in Congress, and it logically follows as a

  <M>Except for petitions for rehearing pursuant to section
  1-40-107, all election contests arising out of a ballot issue or
  ballot question election concerning the order on the ballot or
  the form or content of any ballot title shall be summarily
  adjudicated by the district court sitting for the political
  subdivision within which the contest arises prior to the
  election. Except as otherwise provided in this section, the style
  and form of process, the manner of service of process and papers,
  the fees of officers, and judgment for costs shall be according
  to the rules and practice of the district court. The court that
  first acquires jurisdiction of any contest shall have exclusive
  jurisdiction. Before the district court is required to take
  jurisdiction of the contest, the contestor shall file with the
  clerk of the court a bond, with sureties, running to the
  contestee and conditioned to pay all costs, including attorneys
  fees, in case of failure to maintain the contest. The judge shall
  determine the sufficiency of the bond and, if sufficient, approve
  it.</M>
  <P N="(2)">(2)
  <M>Every such contest shall be commenced by verified petition
  filed by the contestor to the proper court, setting forth the
  grounds for the contest and a proposed alternative order for the
  ballot or alternative form or content for the contested ballot
  title. The contestee shall be the state in the case of a
  statewide ballot issue or statewide ballot question or the
  political subdivision that proposed to place the contested ballot
  issue or ballot question on the ballot, as applicable, and the
  petition representative of an initiated measure. The petition
  shall be filed and a copy served on the contestee within five
  days after the title of the ballot issue or ballot question is
  set by the state or political subdivision and for contests
  concerning the order of a ballot, within five days after the
  ballot order is set by the county clerk and recorder and not
  thereafter. The designated election official or other authorized
  official, on behalf of the contestee and the proponent of an
  initiated measure, shall answer under oath within five days after
  service. Upon the expiration of the time for the answer, and
  following at least twenty-four hours advance notice of the date,
  time, and place of the adjudication given by the clerk of the
  court by letter, telephone, or fax to the contestor and
  contestee, the court having jurisdiction of the contest shall
  immediately set the matter for trial on the merits and shall
  adjudicate it within ten days of the date of filing of the answer
  by the contestee or expiration of the time for the
  answer.</M></P>
  <P N="(3)">(3)
  <M>If the court finds that the order of the ballot or the form or
  content of the ballot title does not conform to the requirements
  of the state constitution and statutes, the court shall provide
  in its order the text of the corrected ballot title or the
  corrected order of the measures to be placed upon the ballot and
  shall award costs and reasonable attorneys fees to the contestor.
  If the court finds that the order of the ballot and the form and
  content of the ballot title conform to the requirements of the
  state constitution and statutes and further finds that the suit
  was frivolous as provided in article 17 of title 13, C.R.S., the
  court shall provide in its order an award of costs and reasonable
  attorneys fees to the contestee state or political subdivision
  and to the proponent of an initiated measure.</M></P>
  <P N="(4)">(4)
  <M>Following entry of the order of the district court pursuant to
  this section, the ballot title shall be certified by the state or
  political subdivision to the county clerk and recorder, to be
  voted upon at the election as so certified unless the election on
  the ballot issue or ballot question is canceled in the manner
  provided by law. Notwithstanding any other provision of law, any
  appeal from an order of the district court entered pursuant to

    <B>This section is constitutional and permissibly limits
    challenges based on the form and content of a ballot
    title</B>but it cannot and does not time-bar constitutional
    challenges to the substance of a ballot issue or ballot
    question. This section does not conflict with art. X, § 20, of
    the Colorado Constitution because the requirements of that
    section that relate to ballot titles address only the form and
    content of ballot titles and not what that section
    substantively permits voters to approve. Cacioppo v. Eagle
    County Sch. Dist. RE-50J, 92 P.3d 453 (Colo. 2004). 
    <P>
    <B>A challenge to a ballot title involves the substance of a
    ballot issue</B>if it relates to the language in the ballot
    title itself and it would be legally impossible for the court
    hearing the challenge to reform or reword the ballot title to
    any constitutionally or statutorily acceptable level so that
    regardless of any contest filed before the election, the ballot
    issue as approved cannot be upheld under the laws or
    constitution of the state. Cacioppo v. Eagle County Sch. Dist.

    <B>A claim that a ballot issue proposed a "phased-in" tax
    increase</B>and that a ballot title that disclosed only the
    first rather than the final full fiscal year dollar increase
    was, therefore, improper involved only the form and content of
    the ballot title, could be resolved by the type of summary
    adjudication contemplated by this section, and was time-barred
    by this section because it was not made within five days of the
    setting of the ballot title. Cacioppo v. Eagle County Sch.
    Dist. RE-50J, 92 P.3d 453 (Colo. 2004).</P>
    <P>
    <B>This section does not apply to a notice required by art. X,
    § 20, of the Colorado Constitution that accompanied a ballot
    title</B>and, therefore, did not bar claims that such a notice
    contained inaccurate financial data and had a misleading
    purpose. Section 1-11-213 (4), however, did bar the claims.
    Cacioppo v. Eagle County Sch. Dist. RE-50J, 92 P.3d 453 (Colo.
    2004).</P>
    <P>
    <B>The final action of a local government legislative body to
    settle or decide the wording of a ballot title</B>constitutes
    the setting or fixing of the ballot title under § 31-11-111.
    Under subsection (2), a person must, therefore, contest the
    form or content of a ballot title within five days of the
    legislative body's final action concerning the ballot title.
    Cacioppo v. Eagle County Sch. Dist. RE-50J, 92 P.3d 453 (Colo.
    2004).</P>
    <P>
    <B>The five-day time limit imposed by subsection (2) is
    constitutional</B>because it is not "manifestly so limited as
    to amount to a denial of justice". Cacioppo v. Eagle County
    Sch. Dist. RE-50J, 92 P.3d 453 (Colo. 2004).</P>
    <P>
    <B>Claim that a ballot issue was invalid because it contained
    multiple purposes is a challenge to the form or content of the
    ballot title.</B>Consequently, the claim was time-barred
    because it was not filed within five days after the title of
    the ballot issue was set. Busse v. City of Golden, 73 P.3d 660

    <B>Scope of contest.</B>Contests of the election of any person
    declared duly elected to any county office, except the office
    of county judge, are governed by this section. Schwarz v.
    County Court, 14 Colo. 44, 23 P. 84 (1890); Kindel v. Le Bert,
    23 Colo. 385, 48 P. 641 (1897); Gray v. Huntley, 77 Colo. 478,

    <P>
    <B>The judge sitting in term time in his regular capacity as
    the court for the county is invested with jurisdiction</B>to
    try and determine contested election cases of county officers.
    Vailes v. Brown, 16 Colo. 462, 27 P. 495 (1891); Gunson v.
    Baldauf, 88 Colo. 436, 297 P. 516 (1931).</P>

    <P>
    <B>A contest proceeding is initiated by</B>the filing of a bond

    <AN-DIV>III.
    <M>BOND REQUIRED.</M></AN-DIV>
    <ANNO-TEXT>
    <B>The bond for costs is for the benefit of the
    contestee.</B>Nicholls v. Barrick, 27 Colo. 432, 62 P. 202
    (1900). 
    <P>
    <B>And whether it be given or not in the first instance does
    not affect the jurisdiction</B>of the court. Nicholls v.
    Barrick, 27 Colo. 432, 62 P. 202 (1900).</P>
    <P>
    <B>So contestee must object.</B>If no bond for costs be given
    when the action is commenced, or if the one accepted be
    insufficient, it is incumbent upon the contestee, to object at
    the earliest opportunity. Nicholls v. Barrick, 27 Colo. 432, 62
    P. 202 (1900).</P>
    <P>
    <B>Otherwise, he will waive his rights</B>in this respect.
    Nicholls v. Barrick, 27 Colo. 432, 62 P. 202 (1900).</P>
    <P>
    <B>The cost bond should not be in any specified penalty, but
    should be conditioned</B>for the payment of all costs. Nicholls
    v. Barrick, 27 Colo. 432, 62 P. 202 (1900).</P>
    <P>
    <B>But the contestee cannot object to the bond because a
    penalty is specified,</B>in the absence of a showing that the
    penalty fixed is insufficient to cover the probable costs which
    he may incur in the case. Nicholls v. Barrick, 27 Colo. 432, 62
    P. 202 (1900).</P>
    <P>
    <B>Attorney fees are not included in "all costs".</B>Amaya v.
    Dist. Court, 197 Colo. 129, 590 P.2d 506
    (1979).</P></ANNO-TEXT>
    <AN-DIV>IV.
    <M>STATEMENT OF CONTEST.</M></AN-DIV>
    <AN-SUB>A.
    <M>Filing.</M></AN-SUB>
    <ANNO-TEXT>
    <B>The contest must be filed within 10 days</B>after the date
    when the votes are canvassed. Vigil v. Garcia, 36 Colo. 430, 87
    P. 543 (1906). 
    <P>
    <B>And this means all the votes.</B>Vigil v. Garcia, 36 Colo.
    430, 87 P. 543 (1906).</P>
    <P>
    <B>However, it does not mean a sufficient number to show that
    one or the other of the parties was elected.</B>Vigil v.
    Garcia, 36 Colo. 430, 87 P. 543 (1906).</P>
    <P>
    <B>But it means the votes of the entire county.</B>Vigil v.
    Garcia, 36 Colo. 430, 87 P. 543 (1906).</P>
    <P>
    <B>And if for any reason one or more precincts are not
    canvassed</B>at the time of the first sitting of the board, the
    statute will not commence to run until those precincts are
    canvassed, even though the returns from those precincts, when
    counted, will not affect the result as between candidates for
    any single office. Vigil v. Garcia, 36 Colo. 430, 87 P. 543
    (1906).</P>
    <P>
    <B>Moreover, the contest provision is to be construed as a
    statute of limitations</B>upon a summary proceeding. Vailes v.
    Brown, 16 Colo. 462, 27 P. 945, 14 L.R.A. 120 (1891).</P>
    <P>
    <B>Whose time limit may not be enlarged.</B>A statutory
    provision requiring notice of contest to be given within a
    given time from either the date of the official count, the
    declaration of the result, or the issuing of the certificate of
    election, etc., is peremptory, and the time cannot be enlarged.
    Vailes v. Brown, 16 Colo. 462, 27 P. 945 (1891).</P>
    <P>
    <B>And there is the strongest reason for enforcing this rule
    most rigidly in cases of contested elections,</B>because
    promptness in commencing and prosecuting the proceedings is of
    the utmost importance to the end that a decision may be reached
    before the term has wholly, or in great part, expired. Vailes
    v. Brown, 16 Colo. 462, 27 P. 945 (1891).</P>
    <P>
    <B>Furthermore, time cannot be extended on ground that last day
    falls on Sunday.</B>When the statutory period for filing the
    statement of an election contest for county officers under this
    section has fully elapsed, excluding the day when the votes are
    canvassed, the time cannot be extended merely on the ground
    that the last day happens to fall on Sunday. This is the
    reasonable as well as the natural and literal interpretation of
    the section. Vailes v. Brown, 16 Colo. 462, 27 P. 945
    (1891).</P>
    <P>
    <B>Although it is clear that the first day must be
    excluded,</B>for the contestor is given 10 days after the day
    when the votes are canvassed to file his statement. Vailes v.
    Brown, 16 Colo. 462, 27 P. 945 (1891).</P></ANNO-TEXT>
    <AN-SUB>B.
    <M>Requisites of Statement.</M></AN-SUB>
    <ANNO-TEXT>
    <B>There must be reasonable definiteness in statements</B>of
    election contests. Suttle v. Sullivan, 131 Colo. 519, 283 P.2d
    636 (1955). 
    <P>
    <B>A statement of contest which contains the averments and
    matters required by statute is sufficient</B>to state a cause
    of action and sufficiently alleges the qualifications of the
    contestor to hold the office. Nicholls v. Barrick, 27 Colo.
    432, 62 P. 202 (1900).</P>
    <P>
    <B>Hence, statement must include the particular cause of the
    contest.</B>A contest proceeding is initiated by the filing of
    a statement of contest, the contents of which must conform to
    this section, and include the particular cause or causes of the
    contest. Gunson v. Baldauf, 88 Colo. 436, 297 P. 516
    (1931).</P>
    <P>
    <B>Causes of contest incorporated by reference.</B>The causes
    of contest are, insofar as applicable, incorporated by
    reference into the provision requiring a contestor of the
    election of county officers to file a written statement setting
    forth, among other things, the causes of the contest, and hence
    also into the provision relating to contests in special
    district elections. Jardon v. Meadowbrook-Fairview Metro.
    Dist., 190 Colo. 528, 549 P.2d 762 (1976).</P>
    <P>
    <B>Where the statement does not allege facts showing that the
    irregularities complained of changed the result of the
    election,</B>the statement does not state a cause of action.
    Suttle v. Sullivan, 131 Colo. 519, 283 P.2d 636 (1955).</P>
    <P>
    <B>Statement of contestor that he is "an elector of the county"
    is a material averment</B>and must be proved if denied by the
    answer or the contest as such must fail. Clanton v. Ryan, 14
    Colo. 419, 24 P. 258 (1890).</P>
    <P>
    <B>Nor is the contestor excused from producing evidence in
    support of such averment on the ground that other competent
    evidence is refused.</B>Clanton v. Ryan, 14 Colo. 419, 24 P.
    258 (1890).</P>
    <P>
    <B>Statement may be amended as to proper name of
    contestee.</B>Where there was an admitted mistake in naming the
    contestee in an election contest, a trial court errs in denying
    contestor's motion to amend the statement of contest. Graham v.
    Swift, 123 Colo. 309, 228 P.2d 969 (1951).</P></ANNO-TEXT>
    <AN-DIV>V.
    <M>ANSWER.</M></AN-DIV>
    <ANNO-TEXT>
    <B>If contestee desires to controvert the truth of the matters
    averred in the statement of contest,</B>he must do so by filing
    an answer in the time prescribed. Lewis v. Boynton, 25 Colo.
    486, 55 P. 732 (1898). 
    <P>
    <B>And contestee cannot avail himself of a demurrer (now motion
    to dismiss for failure to state a claim)</B>for the purpose for
    which it is ordinarily used. Lewis v. Boynton, 25 Colo. 486, 55
    P. 732 (1898).</P>
    <P>
    <B>But if he elects to interpose such a demurrer (now motion to
    dismiss), it must be regarded as the equivalent of an
    answer</B>admitting the truth of the matters averred, in which
    case it is unnecessary to introduce evidence in support of the
    allegations of the statement of contest. Lewis v. Boynton, 25
    Colo. 486, 55 P. 732 (1898).</P></ANNO-TEXT>
    <AN-DIV>VI.
    <M>RECEPTION OF ILLEGAL VOTES OR REJECTION OF LEGAL
    VOTES.</M></AN-DIV>
    <ANNO-TEXT>
    <B>Although a slight ambiguity exists, the evident purpose of
    including the list of disputed votes</B>is to require each
    party to give the other notice of the names of such persons as
    he claims illegally voted for his competitor and of those whose
    votes for himself were illegally rejected. Schwarz v. County
    Court, 14 Colo. 44, 23 P. 84 (1890). 
    <P>
    <B>This provision is mandatory.</B>The provision that, where
    the reception of illegal votes is the ground of contest, a list
    of the persons alleged to have voted illegally must be set
    forth in the statement of contest is mandatory. Town of Sugar
    City v. Bd. of Comm'rs, 57 Colo. 432, 140 P. 809 (1914); Israel
    v. Wood, 98 Colo. 495, 56 P.2d 1324 (1936); Graham v. Swift,
    123 Colo. 309, 228 P.2d 969 (1951).</P>
    <P>
    <B>And it must be strictly construed.</B>Town of Sugar City v.
    Bd. of Comm'rs, 57 Colo. 432, 140 P. 809 (1914).</P>
    <P>
    <B>Moreover, the provisions of the rules of civil procedure
    have no application.</B>Town of Sugar City v. Bd. of Comm'rs,
    57 Colo. 432, 140 P. 809 (1914).</P>
    <P>
    <B>Consequently, in order to give the court jurisdiction, the
    contest statement must contain the required list.</B>Schwarz v.
    County Court, 14 Colo. 44, 23 P. 84 (1890); Town of Sugar City
    v. Bd. of Comm'rs, 57 Colo. 432, 140 P. 809 (1914).</P>
    <P>
    <B>And an amendment to the statement to include the name of the
    voters is not permissible.</B>Town of Sugar City v. Bd. of
    Comm'rs, 57 Colo. 432, 140 P. 809 (1914); Kay v. Strobeck, 81
    Colo. 144, 254 P. 150 (1927).</P>
    <P>
    <B>Also, the omission to furnish the required list of names
    cannot be justified by subsequently alleging</B>that the
    information necessary to prepare the same was in the hands of
    contestee by whose fraud and violence contestor was prevented
    from obtaining it when no effort was made in the first instance
    to either comply with the section or to excuse the failure.
    Schwarz v. County Court, 14 Colo. 44, 23 P. 84 (1890).</P>
    <P>
    <B>Hence, there is no error in the refusal of the court to
    declare a vote illegal where the voter's name was not set
    forth</B>in the statement of contest. Kay v. Strobeck, 81 Colo.
    144, 254 P. 150 (1927).</P>
    <P>
    <B>List concerning absentee voters held not to meet
    requirements.</B>Where exhibit incorporated into statement of
    contest contained a long list of names of persons applying for
    and voting absentee ballots, but there was nothing in the list
    to indicate how many persons therein named were not legally
    qualified residents of the county, or who were not qualified by
    reason of mental or physical incompetence, or who had
    subscribed to an oath before a person unauthorized to
    administer the same, the statement of contest failed to meet
    the requirements for supplying a list of disputed votes. Graham
    v. Swift, 123 Colo. 309, 228 P.2d 969 (1951).</P>
    <P>
    <B>However, list not required where no "rejection" or
    "reception" of votes.</B>In an election contest where the
    contestor alleged that two legal ballots had been rejected
    after they had been placed in the box, the polls had closed,
    and the ballots had been counted and canvassed, the ground of
    contest was not the "rejection" of legal votes or the
    "reception" of illegal votes, and the contestor was not
    required to set forth in his statement of contest a list of the
    number of persons who "so voted" or "offered to vote". Waggoner
    v. Barela, 123 Colo. 436, 230 P.2d 586 (1951).</P>
    <P>
    <B>And a vote is rejected when</B>an elector offers to vote and
    is not permitted to cast a ballot; the rejected vote is a vote
    that is not cast - one that did not reach the ballot box.
    Waggoner v. Barela, 123 Colo. 436, 230 P.2d 586 (1951).</P>
    <P>
    <B>But if an elector is permitted to cast a ballot and to
    deposit it in the ballot box, the vote is accepted</B>and must
    be counted unless it is attacked upon the other ground named in
    the statute, to wit, "the reception of illegal" votes, in which
    event the contest provision requires a list of the names of the
    persons who "so voted", that is, who voted illegally, to be set
    out in the statement of contest. Waggoner v. Barela, 123 Colo.
    436, 230 P.2d 586 (1951).</P>
    <P>
    <B>For the term "so voted" refers to</B>alleged illegal votes
    in the ballot box. Waggoner v. Barela, 123 Colo. 436, 230 P.2d
    586 (1951).</P>
    <P>
    <B>While the term "or offered to vote" refers to</B>electors,
    the rejected votes of whom were not cast or placed in the
    ballot box. Waggoner v. Barela, 123 Colo. 436, 230 P.2d 586
    (1951).</P>
    <P>
    <B>Notwithstanding, illegal votes, whether challenged or not,
    may be considered</B>in an election contest. Russell v.
    Wheeler, 165 Colo. 296, 439 P.2d 43 (1968).</P>
    <P>
    <B>As there is no statutory requirement that contested votes
    must be votes which are challenged</B>at the polling place.
    Russell v. Wheeler, 165 Colo. 296, 439 P.2d 43 (1968).</P>
    <P>
    <B>However, where contestor alleges that an ineligible voter's
    ballot was received and counted for contestee, the burden is on
    the contestor</B>to prove this necessary allegation contained
    in his statement of contest. Porter v. Johnson, 85 Colo. 440,
    276 P. 333 (1929).</P></ANNO-TEXT>

    <M>REPLY TO COUNTERSTATEMENT.</M></AN-DIV>
    <ANNO-TEXT>
    <B>Contestor's assertion of counterstatement's failure to state
    a claim does not deprive contestee's right to proof.</B>In view
    of the specific denial of the charges made in the statement of
    contest, the counterstatement of contest filed by contestee,
    and the requirement that judgment be pronounced, it would be
    unreasonable to hold that the contestor's demurrer (now motion
    to dismiss for failure to state a claim) under such
    circumstances would deprive the contestee of the right to
    demand proof of the charges made by the contestor and to
    introduce testimony in support of his counterstatement of
    contest, inasmuch as such a ruling would deny the contestee his
    day in court. Gunson v. Baldauf, 88 Colo. 436, 297 P. 516

    <B>Annotator's note.</B>The following annotations include cases
    decided under former provisions similar to this section. 
    <P>
    <B>Timing requirement for an election contest not met</B>by a
    lawsuit for injunctive relief filed prior to the election. The
    phrase "within ten days after" imposes two sequential
    conditions on an election contest: (1) "[A]fter" certification
    of election results, and (2) "within" 10 days. Neither
    condition was met. Taxpayers Against Congestion v. Reg'l
    Transp. Dist., 140 P.3d 343 (Colo. App. 2006).</P>
    <P>
    <B>This section governs the time for appeal concerning
    challenges to election results.</B>Cacioppo v. Eagle County
    School District Re-50J, 92 P.3d 453 (Colo. 2004); UMB Bank v.
    Landmark Towers Ass'n, 2017 CO 107, 408 P.3d 836.</P>
    <P>
    <B>This section is a non-claim statute</B>that prohibits
    absolutely the initiation of litigation after a specific period
    of time as a jurisdictional matter. The doctrine of equitable
    estoppel is therefore not available to save an election contest
    if the contestor fails to file a written statement of intent to
    contest the election within the ten-day limit specified in
    subsection (4). UMB Bank v. Landmark Towers Ass'n, 2017 CO 107,
    408 P.3d 836.</P>
    <P>
    <B>Claim that ineligible voters participated in an election and
    that eligible electors did not receive notice of the election
    and therefore were deprived of the opportunity to participate
    in it is not a challenge to the substance of the ballot
    issue.</B>Instead, it is a challenge to the means by which the
    election results were obtained and is thus subject to the
    requirement of subsection (4) that the contestor file a written
    statement of intent to contest an election within ten days
    after the official survey of returns has been filed with the
    designated election official. UMB Bank v. Landmark Towers
    Ass'n, 2017 CO 107, 408 P.3d 836.</P>
    <P>
    <B>Subsection (4) barred claims</B>that a notice required by
    art. X, § 20, of the Colorado Constitution that accompanied a
    ballot title contained inaccurate financial data and had a
    misleading purpose, because the claims did not involve the
    legality or constitutionality of the ballot issue's substance
    but instead concerned only the means by which election results
    were obtained. Cacioppo v. Eagle County Sch. Dist. RE-50J, 92
    P.3d 453 (Colo. 2004).</P>
    <P>
    <B>Subsection (6) mandates factual specificity.</B>Where the
    cause of a contest in an action challenging a school bond issue
    is that illegal votes have been received, subsection (6)
    mandates factual specificity. Abts v. Bd. of Educ., 622 P.2d

    <M>TRIAL.</M></AN-DIV>
    <ANNO-TEXT>
    <B>Purpose of fixing day for trial.</B>This section requiring a
    judge, in an election contest case, to fix a day for trial not
    more than twenty days after the issue is joined is for the
    purpose of enabling a speedy trial and is for the benefit of
    both parties. Nicholls v. Barrick, 27 Colo. 432, 62 P. 202
    (1900). 
    <P>
    <B>But this requirement may be waived</B>by both parties
    consenting to fixing the date of trial at a later date.
    Nicholls v. Barrick, 27 Colo. 432, 62 P. 202 (1900).</P>
    <P>
    <B>However, there is no specific provision for a change of the
    place of trial.</B>Nordloh v. Packard, 45 Colo. 515, 101 P. 787
    (1909).</P>
    <P>
    <B>Nor is there a provision for an application for calling in
    another judge</B>to try the case upon the ground of prejudice
    or partiality of the presiding judge. Nordloh v. Packard, 45
    Colo. 515, 101 P. 787 (1909).</P>
    <P>
    <B>And so, in the absence of any such authority, the rules of
    civil procedure should be followed.</B>Nordloh v. Packard, 45
    Colo. 515, 101 P. 787 (1909).</P>
    <P>
    <B>Under the rules, a party has not the absolute right to have
    his cause tried by a judge other than the regularly elected and
    presiding judge</B>of the court on the alleged ground of the
    latter's prejudice. The matter lies in the sound discretion of
    the judge to whom the application is made, and his decision is
    not reviewable unless an abuse of discretion is shown. Doll v.
    Stewart, 30 Colo. 320, 70 P. 326 (1902); People ex rel.
    Lindsley v. District Court, 30 Colo. 488, 71 P. 388 (1903);
    Nordloh v. Packard, 45 Colo. 515, 101 P. 787 (1909).</P>
    <P>
    <B>Furthermore, an election contest may be tried
    notwithstanding a change of judges after its
    commencement,</B>though the successor must conduct the trial de
    novo. Clanton v. Ryan, 14 Colo. 419, 24 P. 258 (1890); Nordloh
    v. Packard, 45 Colo. 515, 101 P. 787 (1909).</P>
    <P>
    <B>And by the words "other cases" must be understood ordinary
    civil actions.</B>Clanton v. Ryan, 14 Colo. 419, 24 P. 258
    (1890).</P>
    <P>
    <B>But it is not "according to the rules and practice" in the
    trial of ordinary civil actions</B>for one judge to hear the
    evidence, or a part thereof, orally, and then for another judge
    to render a finding and judgment upon such evidence, however
    perfectly the same may have been preserved. Clanton v. Ryan, 14
    Colo. 419, 24 P. 258 (1890).</P>
    <P>
    <B>The object of requiring testimony to be preserved</B>is for
    convenient reference afterwards, or for use on appeal, or as a
    deposition in case a second trial should be had when witnesses
    should have died or removed from the county. Clanton v. Ryan,
    14 Colo. 419, 24 P. 258 (1890).</P>
    <P>
    <B>Where an election contest is dismissed by contestant, over
    the objection of the contestee,</B>after answer and replication
    are filed, such dismissal is not a bar to another contest
    depending on the same facts. Freas v. Engelbrecht, 3 Colo. 377
    (1877); Hallack v. Loft, 19 Colo. 74, 34 P. 568 (1893); Martin
    v. McCarthy, 3 Colo. App. 37, 32 P. 551 (1893); Denver &amp; R.
    G. R. R. v. Iles, 25 Colo. 19, 53 P. 222 (1898); Bd. of Comm'rs
    v. Schradsky, 31 Colo. 178, 71 P. 1104 (1903); Vigil v. Garcia,
    36 Colo. 430, 87 P. 543 (1906).</P></ANNO-TEXT>
    <AN-DIV>III.
    <M>APPEAL.</M></AN-DIV>
    <ANNO-TEXT>
    <B>Limitation upon appeals not repealed by provision for
    review.</B>Provision that writs of error (now writs on appeal)
    to any inferior tribunal shall be the only method for review by
    the supreme court of any action or proceeding, and repealing
    all statutes providing any other method or procedure for
    review, did not repeal the 20-day limitation upon appeals of
    election contest decisions. Sitler v. Brians, 126 Colo. 370,
    251 P.2d 319 (1952). 
    <P>
    <B>Hence, the attempted review of an action to contest election
    not docketed in the supreme court within 20 days</B>from the
    date of judgment is not sought in apt time and a motion to
    dismiss should be granted. Sitler v. Brians, 126 Colo. 370, 251
    P.2d 319 (1952).</P>
    <P>
    <B>Moreover, an application to advance a cause to the head of
    the calendar in the supreme court will not be
    considered</B>until the abstract and all the briefs have been
    filed in accordance with the rule of court and the case is
    ready for submission. Dickinson v. Freed, 24 Colo. 483, 52 P.
    209 (1898).</P>
    <P>
    <B>And objections of contestor not presented by the verified
    statement of contest cannot be considered on review.</B>Israel
    v. Wood, 98 Colo. 495, 56 P.2d 1324 (1936).</P>
    <P>
    <B>When dismissal judgment must be affirmed.</B>If the
    dismissal of an election contest is proper upon any ground,
    whether or not the trial court relied thereon, the judgment
    must be affirmed. Graham v. Swift, 123 Colo. 309, 228 P.2d 969
    (1951).</P>
    <P>
    <B>And the reason assigned by the trial court may in itself be
    insufficient</B>to warrant the judgment, but if upon other
    grounds the judgment is correct, it will not be reversed
    because of faulty reasoning. Graham v. Swift, 123 Colo. 309,
    228 P.2d 969 (1951).</P>
    <P>
    <B>Thus if a statement of contest is insufficient</B>to justify
    further proceedings, then the judgment of the court dismissing
    the action should be affirmed, notwithstanding the fact that no
    motion was presented in the trial court challenging the
    sufficiency of said statement and no specification of points
    with relation thereto appears in the record. Graham v. Swift,
    123 Colo. 309, 228 P.2d 969 (195l).</P></ANNO-TEXT>

    (1925).</P>
    <P>
    <B>Rather, before such an order can be properly made, there
    must be some preliminary evidence</B>supporting the alleged

    Gray v. Huntley, 77 Colo. 478, 238 P. 53 (1925).</P>
    <P>
    <B>And then the matter is within the sound legal discretion of
    the trial court.</B>Kindel v. Le Bert, 23 Colo. 385, 48 P. 641,
    58 Am. St. R. 234 (1897); Gray v. Huntley, 77 Colo. 478, 238 P.
    53 (1925); Harper v. City of Pueblo, 109 Colo. 411, 126 P.2d
    339 (1942).</P>
    <P>
    <B>In addition, the exercise of such discretion, when within
    the limits of the constitution and statutes, is final</B>on
    review when wisely exercised. Gray v. Huntley, 77 Colo. 478,
    238 P. 53 (1925); Winters v. Pacheco, 88 Colo. 105, 292 P. 106l
    (1930).</P>
    <P>
    <B>Ballot boxes should not be ordered open until some positive
    proof is offered</B>to show that the election returns are not
    justified by the ballots in the ballot boxes. Winters v.
    Pacheco, 88 Colo. 105, 292 P. 1061 (1930).</P>
    <P>
    <B>And definite allegations of fraud or allegations that a
    recount will change the result, and a prima facie showing
    thereof, are essential</B>for a recount. Kindel v. Le Bert, 23
    Colo. 385, 48 P. 641 (1897); Harper v. City of Pueblo, 109
    Colo. 411, 126 P.2d 339 (1942).</P>
    <P>
    <B>For, in the absence of a definite and specific assertion, no
    recount is allowed.</B>Harper v. City of Pueblo, 109 Colo. 411,
    126 P.2d 339 (1942).</P>
    <P>
    <B>But when this preliminary proof is offered,</B>it would be a
    gross abuse of discretion for a court to deny contestor the
    right to substantiate his cause by documentary evidence.
    Winters v. Pacheco, 88 Colo. 105, 292 P. 1061 (1930).</P>
    <P>
    <B>And since the ballot itself is the best evidence,</B>with
    all other secondary, it is idle to require witnesses to testify
    as to the illegibility of a ballot which can be produced and
    thereby refute or confirm their statements with reference to
    it. Winters v. Pacheco, 88 Colo. 105, 292 P. 106l (1930).</P>
    <P>
    <B>Thus, where two witnesses testified that they had seen a
    questioned ballot and that it was absolutely illegible, this
    was sufficient proof</B>to justify an order of court for the
    opening of the ballot box and production of the ballot where
    the result of the election depended on such. Winters v.
    Pacheco, 88 Colo. 105, 292 P. 1061 (1930).</P>
    <P>
    <B>Also, comparison of ballots with the poll lists is allowed
    in connection with evidence.</B>Upon the production of evidence
    tending to show error, mistake, fraud, malconduct, or
    corruption on the part of the election board, or any of its
    members, in the matter of receiving, numbering, depositing, or
    canvassing the ballots, or other illegal or irregular conduct
    in respect thereto, an inspection and comparison of the ballots
    with the poll lists should be allowed in connection with the
    oral evidence in reference thereto. Clanton v. Ryan, 14 Colo.
    419, 24 P. 258 (1890).</P>
    <P>
    <B>Charge in answer sufficient to entitle contestor to recount
    as matter of course.</B>Where the answer charged that the boxes
    had been tampered with and had not been preserved by the county
    clerk in the manner provided by law, the contestor assumed the
    burden of proving that they had not been tampered with or
    molested, that they were in the same condition as when received
    by the clerk, and under the issues as made by the pleadings,
    the contestor was entitled to a recount of these ballots as a

  <M>No sooner than two days after receiving the certification from

  the oath upon a finding that extenuating circumstances prevented
  the person from taking the oath within the initial thirty-day

  resignation that is later than the date the letter of resignation
  is submitted, the vacancy committee may meet no more than twenty
  days prior to the effective date of the resignation for the
  purposes of nominating a person to fill the vacancy. The
  certification of the nominee of the vacancy committee to the
  secretary of state may not be made prior to the effective date of
  the resignation; further, should the member of the general

  to fill the vacancy. The certification of the nomination of the

    <B>Annotator's note.</B>The following annotations include cases
    decided under former provisions similar to this section. 
    <P>
    <B>Statutory requirement that state reimburse counties for
    costs associated with an increased level of service found in §
    29-1-304.5 (1) inapplicable to requirement in subsection (1)(a)
    of this section that counties must provide drop-off boxes for
    mail-in ballots at every polling place on election day,
    notwithstanding that this increase in service may create
    additional costs to the county.</B>Statute requiring that the
    costs of conducting an election be a county charge, § 1-5-505
    (1), is in irreconcilable conflict with § 29-1-304.5 (1).
    However, § 1-5-505 (1), which pertains only to election
    funding, is more specific than § 29-1-304.5 (1), which broadly
    applies its reimbursement requirement to most existing state
    programs. Although § 29-1-304.5 (1) was adopted after § 1-5-505
    (1), there is no manifest intent that it should prevail in a
    conflict with the other statute. Rather, the intent of the
    legislature was to prioritize citizens' access to free and fair
    elections over convenience or cost savings to counties. Thus, §
    1-5-505 (1) should prevail over § 29-1-304.5 (1), making the
    unfunded mandate requirement inapplicable to the requirement of
    this section that counties provide drop-off boxes for mail-in
    ballots at every polling place on election day. Gessler v.

  survey of returns, that the difference between the highest number
  of votes cast in the election and the next highest number of
  votes cast in the election is less than or equal to one-half of
  one percent of the highest number of votes cast in the election.
  Any recount conducted pursuant to this subsection (1) shall be
  completed no later than the twenty-eighth day following the
  election and shall be paid for by the governing body of the local
  government. The designated election official shall give notice of
  the recount to the governing body, to all candidates and, in the
  case of a ballot issue or question, to any issue committee that
  are affected by the result of the election. The notice must be

  <M>The designated election official is responsible for conducting
  the recount and shall be assisted by those persons who assisted
  in preparing the official abstract of votes. If those persons
  cannot participate in the recount, other persons shall be
  appointed as provided in section 1-13.5-1301. The designated
  election official may appoint additional persons qualified to be
  the election judges who did not serve as judges in the election
  as assistants in conducting the recount. Persons assisting in the
  conduct of the recount shall be compensated as provided in
  section 1-13.5-1301 (4).</M></P>
  <P N="(4)">(4)
  <M>The designated election official may require the production of

  completed, the designated election official shall notify the
  governing body of the local government conducting the election of

  <M>Legislative declaration.</M></CATCH-LINE>(1)
  <M>The general assembly declares that it is not the intention of
  this article to limit or abridge in any manner the powers
  reserved to the people in the initiative and referendum, but
  rather to properly safeguard, protect, and preserve inviolate for
  them these modern instrumentalities of democratic government.</M>
  <P N="(2)(a)">(2)
  <N></N>(a)
  <M>The general assembly finds, determines, and declares
  that:</M></P>
  <P N="(2)(a)(I)">(I)
  <M>The initiative process relies upon the truthfulness of
  circulators who obtain the petition signatures to qualify a
  ballot issue for the statewide ballot and that during the 2008
  general election, the honesty of many petition circulators was at
  issue because of practices that included: Using third parties to
  circulate petition sections, even though the third parties did
  not sign the circulator's affidavit, were not of legal age to act
  as circulators, and were paid in cash to conceal their
  identities; providing false names or residential addresses in the
  circulator's affidavits, a practice that permits circulators to
  evade detection by persons challenging the secretary of state's
  sufficiency determination; circulating petition sections without
  even a rudimentary understanding of the legal requirements
  relating to petition circulation; and obtaining the signatures of
  persons who purported to notarize circulator affidavits, even
  though such persons were not legally authorized to act as
  notaries or administer the required oath;</M></P>
  <P N="(2)(a)(II)">(II)
  <M>The per signature compensation system used by many petition
  entities provides an incentive for circulators to collect as many
  signatures as possible, without regard for whether all petition
  signers are registered electors; and</M></P>
  <P N="(2)(a)(III)">(III)
  <M>Many petition circulator affidavits are thus executed without
  regard for specific requirements of law that are designed to
  assist in the prevention of fraud, abuse, and mistake in the
  initiative process.</M></P>
  <P N="(2)(b)">(b)
  <M>The general assembly further finds, determines, and declares
  that:</M></P>
  <P N="(2)(b)(I)">(I)
  <M>Because petition circulators who reside in other states
  typically leave Colorado immediately after petitions are
  submitted to the secretary of state for verification, a full and
  fair examination of fraud related to petition circulation is
  frustrated, and as a result, the secretary of state has been
  forced to give effect to certain circulator affidavits that were
  not properly verified and thus were not prima facie evidence of
  the validity of petition signatures on affected petition
  sections; and</M></P>
  <P N="(2)(b)(II)">(II)
  <M>The courts have not had authority to exercise jurisdiction
  over fraudulent acts by circulators and notaries public in
  connection with petition signatures reviewed as part of the
  secretary of state's random sample.</M></P>
  <P N="(2)(c)">(c)
  <M>Therefore, the general assembly finds, determines, and
  declares that:</M></P>
  <P N="(2)(c)(I)">(I)
  <M>As a result of the problems identified in paragraphs (a) and
  (b) of this subsection (2), one or more ballot measures appeared
  on the statewide ballot at the 2008 general election even though
  significant numbers of the underlying petition signatures were
  obtained in direct violation of Colorado law and the accuracy of
  the secretary of state's determination of sufficiency could not
  be fully evaluated by the district court; and</M></P>
  <P N="(2)(c)(II)">(II)
  <M>For the initiative process to operate as an honest expression
  of the voters' reserved legislative power, it is essential that
  circulators truthfully verify all elements of their circulator
  affidavits and make themselves available to participate in
  challenges to the secretary of state's determination of petition
  sufficiency.</M></P></SECTION-TEXT>

  <M>The original typewritten draft of every initiative petition
  for a proposed law or amendment to the state constitution to be
  enacted by the people, before it is signed by any elector, shall
  be submitted by the proponents of the petition to the directors
  of the legislative council and the office of legislative legal
  services for review and comment. Proponents are encouraged to
  write such drafts in plain, nontechnical language and in a clear
  and coherent manner using words with common and everyday meaning
  that are understandable to the average reader. Upon request, any
  agency in the executive department shall assist in reviewing and
  preparing comments on the petition. No later than two weeks after
  the date of submission of the original draft, unless it is
  withdrawn by the proponents, the directors of the legislative
  council and the office of legislative legal services, or their
  designees, shall render their comments to the proponents of the
  petition concerning the format or contents of the petition at a
  review and comment meeting that is open to the public. Where
  appropriate, such comments shall also contain suggested editorial
  changes to promote compliance with the plain language provisions
  of this section. Except with the permission of the proponents,
  the comments shall not be disclosed to any person other than the
  proponents prior to the review and comment meeting.</M>
  <P N="(1.5)">(1.5)
  <M>Both designated representatives of the proponents must appear
  at all review and comment meetings. If either designated
  representative fails to attend a meeting, the measure is
  considered withdrawn by the proponents. If one of the two
  designated representatives fails to attend the review and comment
  meeting, the petition is deemed to be automatically resubmitted
  to the directors of the legislative council and the office of
  legislative legal services for review and comment, unless the
  designated representative present objects to the automatic
  resubmission. No later than five business days after the
  resubmission, the directors shall conduct a review and comment
  meeting in accordance with the requirements of this section. If
  both designated representatives fail to attend the review and
  comment meeting or if the designated representative present
  objects to the automatic resubmission, the proponents may
  thereafter resubmit the initiative petition in accordance with
  subsection (1) of this section.</M></P>
  <P N="(2)">(2)
  <M>After the review and comment meeting but before submission to
  the secretary of state for title setting, the proponents may
  amend the petition in response to some or all of the comments of
  the directors of the legislative council and the office of
  legislative legal services, or their designees. If any
  substantial amendment is made to the petition, other than an
  amendment in direct response to the comments of the directors of
  the legislative council and the office of legislative legal
  services, the amended petition must be resubmitted to the
  directors for comment in accordance with subsection (1) of this
  section prior to submittal to the secretary of state as provided
  in subsection (4) of this section. If the directors have no
  additional comments concerning the amended petition, they may so
  notify the proponents in writing, and, in such case, a review and
  comment meeting on the amended petition pursuant to subsection
  (1) of this section is not required.</M></P>
  <P N="(3)">(3)
  <M>To the extent possible, drafts shall be worded with simplicity
  and clarity and so that the effect of the measure will not be
  misleading or likely to cause confusion among voters. The draft
  shall not present the issue to be decided in such manner that a
  vote for the measure would be a vote against the proposition or
  viewpoint that the voter believes that he or she is casting a
  vote for or, conversely, that a vote against the measure would be
  a vote for a proposition or viewpoint that the voter is
  against.</M></P>
  <P N="(4)">(4)
  <M>After the review and comment meeting provided in subsections
  (1) and (2) of this section, a copy of the original typewritten
  draft submitted to the directors of the legislative council and
  the office of legislative legal services; a copy of the amended
  draft with changes highlighted or otherwise indicated, if any
  amendments were made following the last review and comment
  meeting conducted pursuant to subsections (1) and (2) of this
  section; and an original final draft that gives the final
  language for printing shall be submitted to the secretary of
  state without any title, submission clause, or ballot title
  providing the designation by which the voters shall express their
  choice for or against the proposed law or constitutional
  amendment.</M></P></SECTION-TEXT>

    <M>The following annotations include cases decided under former
    provisions similar to this section.</M></P>

    <P>
    <B>The purpose of the initiative and referendum embodied in the
    constitution</B>was to expeditiously permit the free exercise
    of legislative powers by the people, and the procedural
    statutes enacted in connection therewith were adopted to
    facilitate the execution of the law. Brownlow v. Wunch, 103
    Colo. 120, 83 P.2d 775 (1938); Matter of Title, Ballot Title
    &amp; S. Clause, 872 P.2d 689 (Colo. 1994).</P>
    <P>
    <B>Provisions relating to the initiative should be liberally
    construed to permit,</B>if possible, the exercise by the
    electors of this most important privilege. Brownlow v. Wunch,
    103 Colo. 120, 83 P.2d 775 (1938); Say v. Baker, 137 Colo. 155,

    <B>Citizen held not to have an "interest in the matter in
    litigation" in mandamus proceedings.</B>Where on protest the
    secretary of state refused to file or refile a tendered
    petition to initiate a measure under the initiative and
    referendum act, and mandamus is brought to compel him to file,
    a citizen who feels he will be injured by the measure has not
    such an "interest in the matter in litigation" or "in the
    success of either of the parties to the action", as gives him
    the right to intervene in the mandamus proceeding. Brownlow v.
    Wunch, 102 Colo. 447, 80 P.2d 444 (1938).</P></ANNO-TEXT>

    <ANNO-TEXT>
    <B>People have reserved to themselves right of initiative in §
    1 of art. V, Colo. Const.</B>In re Second Initiated
    Constitutional Amendment, 200 Colo. 141, 613 P.2d 867 (1980). 
    <P>
    <B>No discretion rests with administrative officials</B>to pass
    upon the validity of an act proposed by the people. City of
    Rocky Ford v. Brown, 133 Colo. 262, 293 P.2d 974 (1956).</P>
    <P>
    <B>The people then undertake to legislate for
    themselves.</B>City of Rocky Ford v. Brown, 133 Colo. 262, 293
    P.2d 974 (1956).</P>
    <P>
    <B>And the initiative and referendum laws, where invoked by the
    people,</B>supplant the city council or representative body.
    City of Rocky Ford v. Brown, 133 Colo. 262, 293 P.2d 974
    (1956).</P>
    <P>
    <B>And in the exercise of their right to vote upon such
    proposal,</B>wisely adopt or reject it. City of Rocky Ford v.
    Brown, 133 Colo. 262, 293 P.2d 974 (1956).</P>
    <P>
    <B>And the town or city clerk is required to perform certain
    statutory duties</B>in connection therewith, for failure of
    which he is subject to penalties. City of Rocky Ford v. Brown,
    133 Colo. 262, 293 P.2d 974 (1956).</P>
    <P>
    <B>Because it is not within the discretion of the clerk and
    city council to question the acts of their principal,</B>the
    people. City of Rocky Ford v. Brown, 133 Colo. 262, 293 P.2d
    974 (1956).</P>
    <P>
    <B>The people express their sanction and approval of the
    ordinance by their vote, and its enforcement is attempted</B>by
    one whose rights are affected, then the courts are open to pass
    upon the question of its validity. City of Rocky Ford v. Brown,
    133 Colo. 262, 293 P.2d 974 (1956).</P>
    <P>
    <B>But a proposed ordinance is clothed with the presumption of
    validity</B>and its constitutionality will not be considered by
    the courts by means of a hypothetical question, but only after
    enactment. City of Rocky Ford v. Brown, 133 Colo. 262, 293 P.2d
    974 (1956).</P>
    <P>
    <B>And neither the supreme court nor any other court</B>may be
    called upon to construe or pass upon a legislative act until it
    has been adopted. City of Rocky Ford v. Brown, 133 Colo. 262,
    293 P.2d 974 (1956).</P>
    <P>
    <B>The only exception to this rule is the constitutional
    provision</B>authorizing the general assembly to propound
    interrogatories to the supreme court upon important questions
    upon solemn occasions (§ 3 of art. VI, Colo. Const.). City of
    Rocky Ford v. Brown, 133 Colo. 262, 293 P.2d 974 (1956).</P>
    <P>
    <B>Therefore, it is clear from the provisions of the initiative
    and referendum act</B>and the penalties provided thereby that
    the legislature has been careful and diligent to safeguard the
    primary right of the people to propose and enact their own
    legislation. City of Rocky Ford v. Brown, 133 Colo. 262, 293
    P.2d 974 (1956).</P></ANNO-TEXT>

    <M>REVIEW AND COMMENT BY LEGISLATIVE AGENCIES.</M></AN-DIV>
    <ANNO-TEXT>
    <B>Any proposed initiative must be submitted to the legislative
    research office and the legislative drafting office before it
    is submitted to the initiative title-setting
    board</B>regardless of whether it is substantially similar to a
    previously proposed initiative. Without such submittal, the
    board lacks jurisdiction to set a title. In re Title Pertaining
    to "Tax Reform", 797 P.2d 1283 (Colo. 1990); In re Amendment
    Concerning Limited Gaming in the Town of Idaho Springs, 830
    P.2d 963 (Colo. 1992). 
    <P>
    <B>But where legislative service agencies indicate that they
    have no additional comments beyond those made on first version
    of essentially the same proposal,</B>it is not necessary to
    convene a second review and comment hearing. In re Second
    Proposed Initiative Concerning Uninterrupted Serv. by Pers.
    Employees, 613 P.2d 867 (Colo. 1980).</P>
    <P>
    <B>And where one feature of a proposal is not specifically
    pointed out by legislative service agencies, but is included in
    titles and summary, the measure needs not be
    remanded.</B>Matter of Proposed Initiative for an Amendment
    Entitled "W.A.T.E.R.", 875 P.2d 861 (Colo. 1994).</P>
    <P>
    <B>No resubmission of the amended proposed initiative was
    required by subsection (2)</B>since the amendments made by the
    proponents to the original proposed initiative were made in
    response to the comments of the directors of the legislative
    council and the office of legislative legal services. Matter of
    Proposed Initiative 1997-98 No. 10, 943 P.2d 897 (Colo.
    1997).</P>
    <P>
    <B>Where changes in final version of initiative submitted to
    secretary of state were in direct response</B>to substantive
    questions and comments raised by directors of the legislative
    council and the office of legislative legal services, the
    proponents of the initiative were not required to resubmit the
    initiative to the directors. In re Ballot Title 1999-2000 No.
    256, 12 P.3d 246 (Colo. 2000).</P>
    <P>While particular change was not made in direct response to
    the directors' questions, court concludes that, in the context
    of the amendment as a whole, it was a clarification and not a
    substantive change. Accordingly, change did not require
    resubmission to the directors. In re Ballot Title 1999-2000 No.
    256, 12 P.3d 246 (Colo. 2000).</P>
    <P>Change made in response to director's comment about a
    suggested grammatical change and comment regarding the overlap
    of terms used in the proposed initiative did not require
    proponents to resubmit initiative. In re Ballot Title 2007-2008
    No. 57, 185 P.3d 142 (Colo. 2008).</P>
    <P>
    <B>Proponents' failure to indicate changes as specified in
    subsection (4) justified board's refusal to set a

  ratios, or other measures, including matters pertaining to tax
  classification, definitions, credits, exemptions, monetary
  thresholds, qualifications for taxation, or any combination
  thereof, that reduce or increase a district's tax collections.
  "Tax change" does not mean an initiated ballot issue or initiated

    <P>
    <B>Flexible level of scrutiny applies to challenge of § 1 (5.5)
    of article V of the state constitution and the statutory
    title-setting procedures implementing it.</B>Under this
    standard, courts must weigh the "character and magnitude of the
    asserted injury to the rights protected by the first and
    fourteenth amendments that the plaintiff seeks to vindicate"
    against the "precise interests put forward by the State as
    justifications for the burden imposed by its rule", taking into
    consideration "the extent to which those interests make it
    necessary to burden the plaintiff's rights". Anderson v.

    (1983); Campbell v. Buckley, 11 F. Supp. 2d 1260 (D. Colo.
    1998).</P>
    <P>
    <B>Single-subject requirement in § 1 (5.5) of article V of the
    constitution and the statutory title-setting procedures
    implementing it do not violate initiative proponents' free
    speech or associational rights under the first amendment nor do
    they discriminate against proponents in violation of the
    fourteenth amendment's equal protection clause.</B>Campbell v.
    Buckley, 11 F. Supp. 2d 1260 (D. Colo. 1998), aff'd, 203 F.3d
    738 (10th Cir. 2000).</P>
    <P>
    <B>The summary, single subject and title requirements</B>serve
    to prevent voter confusion and promote informed decisions by
    narrowing the initiative to a single matter and providing
    information on that single subject. Campbell v. Buckley, 203
    F.3d 738 (10th Cir. 2000).</P>
    <P>The requirements serve to prevent a provision that would not
    otherwise pass from becoming law by "piggybacking" it on a more
    popular proposal or concealing it in a long and complex
    initiative. Campbell v. Buckley, 203 F.3d 738 (10th Cir.
    2000).</P>
    <P>
    <B>The 12-day notice requirement in subsection (1) only governs
    the time requirement for submitting a draft of the text of the
    initiative.</B>Subsection (1) does not require that any
    proposed amendments or modifications to the title or submission
    clause be submitted to the board at least twelve days prior to
    the hearing. Proposed additions or deletions from the title and
    submission clause may be offered by any registered elector
    during the public hearing or rehearing before the board. In re
    Proposed Initiated Constitutional Amendment, 877 P.2d 329
    (Colo. 1994).</P>
    <P>
    <B>"Substantial compliance" is the standard by which to judge
    compliance with the fiscal impact information filing
    requirements of subsection (3)(a).</B>Invalidation of the
    board's actions when the fiscal impact information was filed
    five minutes late, then refiled three hours later to correct a
    calculation error, would impermissibly infringe on the
    fundamental right of initiative. In re Ballot Title 1999-2000
    No. 255, 4 P.3d 485 (Colo. 2000) (decided under law in effect
    prior to 2000 amendment).</P>
    <P>

    <M>FILING.</M></AN-DIV>
    <ANNO-TEXT>
    <B>The filing of a petition to initiate a measure under the
    initiative and referendum statute is a ministerial act,</B>and
    the secretary of state has discretion in the first instance to
    determine its sufficiency to entitle it to be filed. Brownlow

    <M>STATUTORY BOARD.</M></AN-DIV>
    <ANNO-TEXT>
    <B>It is the duty of those to whom the duty is assigned to
    prepare a title to an initiated measure</B>to use such language
    as shall correctly and fairly express the true intent and
    meaning of the proposal to be submitted to the voters. Say v.
    Baker, 137 Colo. 155, 322 P.2d 317 (1958). 
    <P>
    <B>But the action of the statutory board empowered to fix a
    ballot title and submission clause is presumptively
    valid.</B>Say v. Baker, 137 Colo. 155, 322 P.2d 317 (1958); In
    re Proposed Initiative "Automobile Insurance Coverage," 877
    P.2d 853 (Colo. 1994); In re Proposed Initiative 1997-1998 No.
    75, 960 P.2d 672 (Colo. 1998); Matter of Title, Ballot Title

    Title, Ballot Title &amp; Sub. Clause, &amp; Summary for
    1999-2000 No. 104, 987 P.2d 249 (Colo. 1999).</P>
    <P>
    <B>And the supreme court employs all legitimate presumptions in
    favor of the title board's actions,</B>gives great deference to
    the title board in the exercise of its drafting authority, and
    will reverse its decision only if a title is insufficient,
    unfair, or misleading. In re Title, Ballot Title, Sub. Cl. for
    2009-2010 No. 45; In the Matter of the Title, Ballot Title
    &amp; Sub. Clause for 2015-2016 No. 63, 2016 CO 34, 370 P.3d

    867.</P>
    <P>
    <B>And those who contend to the contrary must show</B>wherein
    the assigned title does not meet the statutory requirement. Say
    v. Baker, 137 Colo. 155, 322 P.2d 317 (1958).</P>
    <P>
    <B>The reason being that, under our system of
    government,</B>the resolution of these questions, when the
    formalities for submission have been met, rests with the
    electorate. Say v. Baker, 137 Colo. 155, 322 P.2d 317
    (1958).</P>
    <P>
    <B>Title board had discretion to set the titles and summary of
    proposed</B>initiative despite proponents' failure to indicate
    all of the differences between the original and final versions
    of the measure submitted to the secretary of state. Matter of
    Prop. Init. Const. Amend. 1996-3, 917 P.2d 1274 (Colo.
    1996).</P>
    <P>
    <B>Title board lacks jurisdiction to set a title</B>if any
    designated representative of the proponents of a proposed
    initiative fails to appear at a title board meeting at which
    the proposed initiative is considered. Subsection (4) reflects
    the general assembly's clear and unambiguous intent to require
    both designated representatives to appear at any title board
    hearing, including a rehearing, at which the proposed
    initiative is being considered. Hayes v. Ottke, 2013 CO 1, 293
    P.3d 551.</P>
    <P>
    <B>Substitution of a third party for one of the designated
    representatives divests the title board of jurisdiction to
    act</B>in any meeting at which either of the original
    designated representatives is not present. In re Ballot Title
    2013-2014 No. 103, 2014 CO 61, 328 P.3d 127.</P>
    <P>
    <B>Requirements of this section concerning designated
    representatives are no longer merely procedural
    requirements</B>promoting efficient notification, but are
    instead substantive requirements designed to promote the
    purpose of the title setting process by ensuring that the title
    board has access to the information that it needs to resolve
    the substantive issues raised at any meeting concerning a
    proposed initiative. Hayes v. Ottke, 2013 CO 1, 293 P.3d 551
    (overruling Matter of the Proposed Initiated Constitutional
    Amendment Concerning Limited Gaming in the City of Antonito,
    873 P.2d 733 (Colo. 1994)).</P>
    <P>
    <B>Board was created by statute to assist the people</B>in the
    implementation of their right to initiate laws. In re Proposed
    Initiative Concerning Drinking Age, 691 P.2d 1127 (Colo.
    1984).</P>
    <P>
    <B>Deputy attorney general.</B>Because the title board is
    created by statute, the attorney general may designate,
    pursuant to § 24-31-103, a deputy to serve in her place.
    Amendment to Const. Section 2 to Art. VII, 900 P.2d 104 (Colo.
    1995).</P>
    <P>
    <B>Delegation.</B>Because the title board is created by
    statute, the attorney general, pursuant to § 24-31-103, and the
    secretary of state, pursuant to § 24-21-105, may designate
    deputies to serve in their place. Matter of Title, Ballot Title
    &amp; Sub. Cl., 900 P.2d 121 (Colo. 1995).</P>
    <P>
    <B>The provisions of this statute, rather than those of the
    State Administrative Procedure Act,</B>govern the Board's
    action in designating and fixing the title, ballot title and
    submission clause, and summary of a proposed initiative
    measure. In re Proposed Initiative Entitled W.A.T.E.R., 831
    P.2d 1301 (Colo. 1992).</P>
    <P>
    <B>Plaintiff has a liberty right to challenge the decision of
    the title board.</B>This section and § 1-40-101 insufficiently
    provide for the notice required by the United States
    Constitution to protect this liberty interest, thereby
    depriving plaintiff of her constitutional rights. Montero v.
    Meyer, 790 F. Supp. 1531 (D. Colo. 1992).</P>
    <P>As to all initiatives and referenda hearings governed by
    this section occurring after April 27, 1992, defendants are
    ordered to publish pre-hearing and post-hearing notices to
    electors at least sufficient to meet the fair notice
    requirements of due process of law under the fourteenth
    amendment to the United States Constitution. Montero v. Meyer,
    790 F. Supp. 1531 (D. Colo. 1992).</P>
    <P>
    <B>Neither the secretary of state nor any reviewing court
    should be concerned with the merit</B>or lack of merit of a
    proposed constitutional amendment. Say v. Baker, 137 Colo. 155,
    322 P.2d 317 (1958).</P>
    <P>
    <B>And a board acts wisely in refusing to use words in a title
    which would tend to color the merit</B>of the proposal on one
    side or the other. Say v. Baker, 137 Colo. 155, 322 P.2d 317
    (1958).</P>
    <P>
    <B>The burden of proving procedural noncompliance rests with
    the petitioner, not with the proponents of the initiative.</B>A
    presumption exists that the secretary of state properly
    determined the sufficiency of the filing of a petition to
    initiate a measure. Because the petitioner has not shown any
    defect in the proceeding that would destroy the board's
    jurisdiction in the matter, the petitioner's jurisdictional
    challenge is rejected. In re Petition on Campaign &amp;
    Political Fin., 877 P.2d 311 (Colo. 1994).</P>
    <P>
    <B>Board is not required to give opinion regarding ambiguity of
    a proposed initiative,</B>nor is it necessary for the board to
    be concerned with legal issues which the proposed initiative
    may create. Matter of Title, Ballot Title, Etc., 797 P.2d 1275
    (Colo. 1990).</P>
    <P>
    <B>Task of the board is to provide a concise summary of the
    proposed initiative, focusing on the most critical aspects of
    the proposal, not simply to restate all of the provisions of
    the proposed initiative.</B>Board not required to include every
    aspect of a proposal in the title and submission clause. In re
    Ballot Title 1999-2000 No. 235(a), 3 P.3d 1219 (Colo.
    2000).</P>
    <P>
    <B>Board may be challenged when misleading summary of amendment
    prejudicial.</B>A misleading summary of the fiscal impact of a
    proposed amendment is likely to create an unfair prejudice
    against the measure and is a sufficient basis, under this
    section, for challenging the board's action. In re An Initiated
    Constitutional Amendment, 199 Colo. 409, 609 P.2d 631
    (1980).</P>
    <P>
    <B>Request for agency assistance at board's discretion.</B>The
    decision of whether and from which of the two state agencies to
    request information is within the discretion of the board.
    Spelts v. Klausing, 649 P.2d 303 (Colo. 1982).</P>
    <P>
    <B>Technical correction of proposed initiative
    permitted.</B>Allowing a technical correction of the proposed
    initiative to conform with the intent of the proponents does
    not frustrate the purpose of the statute. Spelts v. Klausing,
    649 P.2d 303 (Colo. 1982).</P>
    <P>
    <B>Purpose of statutory time table for meetings of initiative
    title setting review board is</B>to assure that the titles,
    submission clause, and summary of an initiated measure are
    considered promptly by the board well in advance of the date by
    which the signed petitions must be filed with the secretary of
    state. In re Second Initiated Constitutional Amendment, 200
    Colo. 141, 613 P.2d 867 (1980); Matter of Title Concerning Sch.
    Impact Fees, 954 P.2d 586 (Colo. 1998).</P>
    <P>
    <B>Section not frustrated by next-day continuance of statutory
    date for last meeting.</B>A continuance to the next day
    following the statutory date for the last meeting in order to
    comply fully with other statutory requirements does not

    <P>
    <B>Initiative did not qualify for November 1997
    election.</B>The requisite signatures had to be filed in the
    first week of August, but the title setting was not until the
    third week in that month and the board could not meet to

    <P>
    <B>Board had the authority to set a title, ballot title and
    submission clause, and summary for the proposed constitutional
    amendment at issue,</B>but the question of the board's
    jurisdiction to set titles for a ballot issue in an
    odd-numbered year was premature, as the secretary of state, not
    the board, has the authority to place measures on the ballot.
    Matter of Election Reform Amendment, 852 P.2d 28 (Colo.

    <P>
    <B>Board had the authority to set the titles and summary of an

    <B>The purpose of the title-setting process</B>is to ensure
    that both the persons reviewing an initiative petition and the
    voters are fairly and succinctly advised of the import of the
    proposed law. In re Proposed Initiative on Educ. Tax Refund,
    823 P.2d 1353 (Colo. 1991); Matter of Title, Ballot Title &amp;

    <P>
    <B>The clear title requirement seeks to accomplish the two
    overarching goals</B>of preventing voter confusion and ensuring
    that the title of a proposed initiative adequately expresses
    the intended purpose of the initiative so that the voters, even
    if they are not familiar with the subject matter, can
    intelligently determine whether to support or oppose the
    proposed initiative. Robinson v. Dierking, 2016 CO 56, 413 P.3d
    151.</P>
    <P>
    <B>A sufficiently clear title</B>enables the electorate,
    whether familiar or unfamiliar with the subject matter of a
    particular proposal, to determine intelligently whether to
    support or oppose the proposal. In re Ballot Title 2011-2012
    No. 45, 2012 CO 26, 274 P.3d 576.</P>
    <P>
    <B>Initiated measure's title, as set by review board, must be
    proper and fair</B>and must correctly and fairly express the
    true intent and meaning of the proposed measure. In re Second
    Initiated Constitutional Amendment, 200 Colo. 141, 613 P.2d 867
    (1980); In re Proposed Initiative on Parental Notification of
    Abortions for Minors, 794 P.2d 238 (Colo. 1990).</P>
    <P>Ballot title shall correctly and fairly express the true
    intent and meaning of the proposed measure and shall
    unambiguously state the principle of the provision sought to be
    added, amended, or repealed. In re Proposed Initiative for

    <P>The titles must be fair, clear, accurate, and complete, but
    they need not set out every detail of the initiative. Court
    reviews titles set by the board with great deference and will
    only reverse the board's decision if the titles are
    insufficient, unfair, or misleading. In re Ballot Title

    <P>It is not the court's function to write the best possible
    titles. Only if the Board's chosen language is clearly
    inaccurate or misleading will the court reverse it. Nor is it
    the court's function to speculate on the future effects the
    initiative may have if it is adopted. Whether the initiative
    will indeed have the effect claimed by petitioners is beyond
    the scope of the court's review. In re Ballot Title 1999-2000
    No. 256, 12 P.3d 246 (Colo. 2000).</P>
    <P>
    <B>Title must clearly express the single subject of an
    initiative,</B>correctly and fairly express the true meaning
    and intent of the initiative, enable the electorate, whether
    familiar or unfamiliar with the subject matter of a particular
    proposal, to determine intelligently whether to support or
    oppose the proposal, and be brief. The title board is given
    discretion in resolving interrelated problems of length,
    complexity, and clarity in designating a title and must
    summarize the central features of a proposed initiative fairly.

    <P>
    <B>Title board has considerable discretion in setting the title
    for a proposed initiative,</B>the supreme court will employ all
    legitimate presumptions in favor of the propriety of the
    board's actions, and, when reviewing a title set by the board
    for clarity and accuracy, the court will reverse the board's
    actions only if the title is insufficient, unfair, or
    misleading. Robinson v. Dierking, 2016 CO 56, 413 P.3d 151; In

    <P>
    <B>Title and summary fail to convey to voters the initiative's
    likely impact on state spending on state
    programs,</B>therefore, they may not be presented to voters as
    currently written. Title and summary are not clear perhaps
    because the original text of the proposed initiative is
    difficult to comprehend. Matter of Title, Ballot Title &amp;

    <P>
    <B>Burden for invalidating an amendment</B>because of an
    alleged misleading ballot title, after adoption by the people
    in a general election, is heavy since the general assembly has
    provided procedures for challenging a ballot title prior to
    elections. Unless the challengers to the amendment can prove
    that so many voters were actually misled by the title that the
    result of the election might have been different, the challenge
    will fail. City of Glendale v. Buchanan, 195 Colo. 267, 578

    <B>Duty to voters is paramount.</B>Board should not resolve all

    <P>
    <B>Brief title for measure to repeal a single complex

    Taxpayer's Bill of Rights as "an amendment to the Colorado
    constitution concerning the repeal of the Taxpayer's Bill of
    Rights, article X, section 20, of the Colorado constitution"
    satisfies the clear title requirement. The title clearly
    specifies the purpose of the measure and allows voters to
    determine intelligently whether to support it. Listing specific
    features of the provision being repealed would have made the
    title longer and more difficult to read, and picking and
    choosing which provisions to list would likely have led to
    contentions that the title is not impartial. "Taxpayer's Bill
    of Rights" is not a prohibited catchphrase because it does no
    more than invoke the name of the constitutional provision that
    the measure would repeal and properly and impartially explains
    to voters what the measure seeks to achieve. In re Proposed

    <P>No clear case presented for the invalidation of titles fixed

    It is implausible to suggest that a voter reasonably could have
    considered voting in favor of one paragraph in the ballot title
    and against the other paragraph where the only difference
    between the two paragraphs is that one paragraph is slightly
    more detailed than the other. Bickel v. City of Boulder, 885

    <P>It was within the board's discretion to omit information

    <B>Absence of definitions was distinguishable from situation in
    In re Proposed Initiative on Parental Notification of Abortions
    for Minors, 794 P.2d 238 (Colo. 1990),</B>since although the
    definitions may have been broader than common usage in some
    respects and narrower in others, they appeared to be included
    for sake of brevity and they would not adopt a new or

    all concerned with the issues surrounding election reform.
    Matter of Election Reform Amendment, 852 P.2d 28 (Colo.

    <P>The titles are not required to include definitions of terms
    unless the terms adopt a new or controversial legal standard
    that would be of significance to all concerned with the
    initiative. In re Ballot Title 1999-2000 No. 255, 4 P.3d 485
    (Colo. 2000).</P>
    <P>And the board is not usually required to define a term that

    <P>
    <B>A title and summary that repeat or reword much of the
    language of the proposed initiative and contain complex clauses

    <P>
    <B>Titles are fair, sufficient, and clear.</B>Titles track the
    language of the proposed initiative. By using general language
    suggesting initiative limited to "tax or debt campaigns",
    titles fairly put public on notice that provision applies to
    any election that affects taxes or the creation of public debt.
    Although titles do not mention "pass-through" or "pooling"
    provisions of proposed initiative, these provisions are not
    central features of the measure. Finally, because titles state
    that any election that violates provisions of the initiative is
    void, titles that fail to disclose that district must refund
    moneys collected in violation of initiative are not confusing,
    and voters would not be misled. In re Ballot Title 2005-2006

    <P>
    <B>Title satisfied the clear title requirement,</B>even though
    it necessarily contained several terms of art due to the
    technical nature of state water law, because it expressly
    stated a single subject of public control of water and
    summarized clarifying provisions of the proposed initiative so
    that the voters could understand the initiative's purpose and
    substance. In re Ballot Title 2011-2012 No. 45, 2012 CO 26, 274
    P.3d 576.</P>
    <P>Where a measure includes both constitutional amendments and
    statutory changes, the title need not specifically indicate
    that a provision establishing a new sales tax on
    tobacco-derived nicotine vapor products is statutory rather
    than constitutional. Where the measure would also reallocate
    existing funding from several programs to a new preschool
    program, it was sufficient for the title board to summarize
    generally the category of programs from which funding would be
    reallocated rather than listing all of the programs or "key"
    programs. In re Title, Ballot Title &amp; Submission Clause for

    <B>The court's scope of review is limited</B>to ensuring that

    fairly reflect the proposed initiative so that petition signers

    <P>Board's actions are presumptively valid, and this

    <P>It is not the function of the court to rewrite the titles
    and summary to achieve the best possible statement of the
    proposed measure's intent, and the court will reverse the
    board's action in setting the titles only when the language
    chosen is clearly misleading. In re Ballot Title 1999-2000 No.
    255, 4 P.3d 485 (Colo. 2000).</P>
    <P>While subsection (3)(b) requires that the title "correctly
    and fairly express the true intent and meaning" of the
    initiative, it is not the court's role to rephrase the language
    adopted by the board to obtain the most precise and exact
    title. Matter of Increase of Taxes on Tob. Prod. Initiative,

    <P>The fiscal impact statement adequately described impact

    <P>
    <B>Lack of specificity held justified.</B>The Board has no
    independent fact-finding ability and its choice of language was
    judicious and within its authority. The fiscal impact could not
    reasonably be determined because of inherent uncertainties in
    the text of the amendment. In Re Prop. Init. "Fair Fishing",
    877 P.2d 1355 (Colo. 1994).</P>
    <P>
    <B>Statement of fiscal impact was insufficient</B>since,
    although the board was not required to include a definitive
    estimate of any fiscal impact on the state or its political
    subdivisions when that impact cannot be determined because of
    the variables involved, where the indeterminacy resulted from
    the multitude of provisions having separate and sometimes
    conflicting fiscal impacts producing an indeterminate aggregate
    impact and the board had sufficient information to assess the
    fiscal impact of each provision in isolation, the board should
    state with specificity which provisions will have fiscal
    impacts which are capable of being estimated, and which are
    truly indeterminate. Matter of Election Reform Amendment, 852

    <P>Board has discretion in exercising its judgment in how to

    <P>
    <B>Fiscal impact statement was inaccurate description of the

    Spelts v. Klausing, 649 P.2d 303 (Colo. 1982).</P>
    <P>
    <B>Summary need not mention the effect of the amendment on an

    <P>
    <B>The board is not required to provide lengthy

    <P>
    <B>Board may be challenged when misleading summary of amendment
    prejudicial.</B>A misleading summary of the fiscal impact of a

    <P>
    <B>The titles and summary were not misleading since they

    Matter of Proposed Initiative 1997-98 No. 10, 943 P.2d 897
    (Colo. 1997).</P>
    <P>Proposed initiative violates the single-subject requirement

    <B>The supreme court employs all legitimate presumptions in
    favor of the propriety of the title board's actions</B>and will
    overturn the title board's finding that a proposed initiative
    contains a single subject only in a clear case. Title, Ballot

    <B>In determining whether a proposed measure contains more than
    one subject, the court may not interpret the language of the
    measure or predict its application if it is adopted.</B>In re

    <P>
    <B>In order to violate the single-subject requirement, the text
    of the measure must relate to more than one subject and have at
    least two distinct and separate purposes which are not
    dependent upon or connected with each other.</B>The
    single-subject requirement is not violated if the matters
    included are necessarily or properly connected to each other.

    1127 (Colo. 1996).</P>
    <P>In order to pass constitutional muster, a proposed
    initiative must concern only one subject. In other words, it
    must effectuate or carry out only one general object or
    purpose. In re Ballot Title 2005-2006 No. 73, 135 P.3d 736
    (Colo. 2006); In re Ballot Title 2005-2006 No. 74, 136 P.3d 237
    (Colo. 2006).</P>
    <P>
    <B>The single-subject requirement serves two functions:</B>It
    ensures that each proposed measure depends upon its own merits
    for passage by preventing inclusion in one measure subjects
    having no necessary or proper connection for the purpose of
    enlisting support for the measure from separate advocates for
    each of the subjects, and it prevents fraud and surprise from
    being practiced upon voters through the inadvertent passage of
    a surreptitious provision coiled up in the folds of a complex
    measure. Title, Ballot Title &amp; Sub. Clause for 2015-2016
    No. 132, 2016 CO 55, 374 P.3d 460.</P>
    <P>First, it is intended to forbid the treatment of incongruous
    subjects in the same measure, especially the practice of
    putting in one measure subjects having no necessary or proper
    connection, for the purpose of enlisting in support of the
    measure the advocates of each measure, and thus securing the
    enactment of measures that could not be carried upon their
    merits. Second, the single-subject requirement seeks to prevent
    surreptitious measures and apprise the people of the subject of
    each measure by the title, that is, to prevent surprise and
    fraud from being practiced upon voters. In re Ballot Title
    2019-2020 No. 3, 2019 CO 57, 442 P.3d 867.</P>
    <P>
    <B>The intent</B>of the requirement that an initiative be
    limited to a single subject is to ensure that each proposal
    depends on its own merits for passage. Matter of Proposed
    Initiative 1996-17, 920 P.2d 798 (Colo. 1996); Matter of Title,
    Ballot Title for 1997-98 No. 105, 961 P.2d 1092 (Colo.
    1998).</P>
    <P>Subsection (1)(a)(I) prohibits the joinder of incongruous
    subjects in the same petition. Matter of Title, Ballot Title
    for 1997-98 No. 105, 961 P.2d 1092 (Colo. 1998).</P>
    <P>
    <B>The intent of the single-subject requirement</B>is to
    prevent voters from being confused or misled and to ensure that
    each proposal is considered on its own merits. Matter of Ballot
    Title 1997-98 No. 74, 962 P.2d 927 (Colo. 1998).</P>
    <P>
    <B>The single-subject requirement must be liberally
    construed</B>so as not to impose undue restrictions on the
    initiative process. Matter of Ballot Title 1997-98 No. 74, 962
    P.2d 927 (Colo. 1998).</P>
    <P>
    <B>The single-subject requirement is not violated</B>simply
    because an initiative with a single, distinct purpose spells
    out details relating to its implementation. As long as the
    procedures specified have a necessary and proper relationship
    to the substance of the initiative, they are not a separate
    subject. Matter of Ballot Title 1997-98 No. 74, 962 P.2d 927
    (Colo. 1998); In re Ballot Title 1999-2000 No. 255, 4 P.3d 485
    (Colo. 2000).</P>
    <P>A proposed measure that tends to effect or to carry out one
    general purpose presents only one subject. Consequently, minor
    provisions necessary to effectuate the purpose of the measure
    are properly included within its text. In re Ballot Title
    1999-2000 No. 256, 12 P.3d 246 (Colo. 2000); Title, Ballot
    Title &amp; Sub. Clause for 2015-2016 No. 132, 2016 CO 55, 374
    P.3d 460.</P>
    <P>Just because a proposal may have different effects or that
    it makes policy choices that are not invariably interconnected
    does not mean that it necessarily violates the single-subject
    requirement. It is enough that the provisions of a proposal are
    connected. Here, the initiative addresses numerous issues in a
    detailed manner. However, all of these issues relate to the
    management of development. In re Ballot Title 1999-2000 No.
    256, 12 P.3d 246 (Colo. 2000).</P>
    <P>To evaluate whether or not an initiative effectuates or
    carries out only one general object or purpose, supreme court
    looks to the text of the proposed initiative. The
    single-subject requirement is not violated if the "matters
    encompassed are necessarily or properly connected to each other
    rather than disconnected or incongruous". Stated another way,
    the single-subject requirement is not violated unless the text
    of the measure "relates to more than one subject and has at
    least two distinct and separate purposes that are not dependent
    upon or connected with each other". Mere implementation or
    enforcement details directly tied to the initiative's single
    subject will not, in and of themselves, constitute a separate
    subject. Finally, in order to pass the single-subject test,
    subject of the initiative should also be capable of being
    expressed in the initiative's title. In re Ballot Title
    2005-2006 No. 73, 135 P.3d 736 (Colo. 2006); In re Ballot Title
    2005-2006 No. 74, 136 P.3d 237 (Colo. 2006).</P>
    <P>
    <B>Subjecting proposed initiative to a limitation imposed by
    the U.S. constitution, as interpreted by the U.S. supreme
    court, does not violate single-subject requirement.</B>All
    state statutory and constitutional measures are subject to
    implicit limitation that the U.S. constitution, as interpreted
    by the U.S. supreme court, may require otherwise; a finding
    that such limitation violates the single-subject requirement
    would result in no measure satisfying the single-subject
    requirement. In re Ballot Title 2007-2008 No. 61, 184 P.3d 747
    (Colo. 2008).</P>
    <P>Likewise, provision allowing state to act in accordance with
    the U.S. constitution, as interpreted by U.S. supreme court,
    does not violate single-subject requirement. In re Ballot Title
    2007-2008 No. 61, 184 P.3d 747 (Colo. 2008).</P>
    <P>
    <B>Measure is not deceptive or surreptitious merely because its
    content depends on the U.S. constitution, as interpreted by the
    U.S. supreme court.</B>In re Ballot Title 2007-2008 No. 61, 184
    P.3d 747 (Colo. 2008).</P>
    <P>
    <B>The fact that provisions of measure may affect more than one
    statutory provision does not itself mean that measure contains
    multiple subjects.</B>Where initiative requiring background
    checks at gun shows also authorizes licensed gun dealers who
    conduct such background checks to charge a fee, the initiative
    contains a single subject. In re Ballot Title 1999-2000 No.
    255, 4 P.3d 485 (Colo. 2000).</P>
    <P>
    <B>Single-subject requirement eliminates the practice of
    combining several unrelated subjects in a single measure</B>for
    the purpose of enlisting support from advocates of each subject
    and thus securing the enactment of measures that might not
    otherwise be approved by voters on the basis of the merits of
    those discrete measures. In re Petitions, 907 P.2d 586 (Colo.
    1995); In re Proposed Initiative 1996-4, 916 P.2d 528 (Colo.
    1996).</P>
    <P>
    <B>A proposed measure impermissibly includes more than one
    subject</B>if its text relates to more than one subject and if
    the measure has at least two distinct and separate purposes
    that are not dependent upon or connected with each other. In re
    Proposed Initiative 1996-4, 916 P.2d 528 (Colo. 1996); In re
    Ballot Title 1999-2000 No. 235(a), 3 P.3d 1219 (Colo.
    2000).</P>
    <P>Grouping the provisions of a proposed initiative under a
    broad concept that potentially misleads voters will not satisfy
    the single-subject requirement. In re Proposed Initiative
    1996-4, 916 P.2d 528 (Colo. 1996); In re Ballot Title 1999-2000
    Nos. 245(b), 245(c), 245(d), and 245(e), 1 P.3d 720 (Colo.

    P.3d 739 (Colo. 2000).</P>
    <P>
    <B>Neither this section nor §1(5.5) of article V of the state
    constitution creates any exemptions for initiatives that
    attempt to repeal constitutional provisions.</B>Also, no
    special permission exists for initiatives that seek to address
    constitutional provisions adopted prior to the enactment of the
    single-subject requirement. In re Proposed Initiative 1996-4,
    916 P.2d 528 (Colo. 1996).</P>

    <B>The term "measure" includes initiatives that either enact or
    repeal.</B>In re Proposed Initiative 1996-4, 916 P.2d 528
    (Colo. 1996).</P>
    <P>
    <B>No exception to single-subject requirement for repeal
    measures.</B>In ruling that an initiative to repeal the
    Taxpayer's Bill of Rights (TABOR) in full satisfies the
    single-subject requirement, the supreme court is not adopting
    an exception to the single-subject rule for repeal measures. In
    re Ballot Title 2019-2020 No. 3, 2019 CO 57, 442 P.3d 867.</P>
    <P>
    <B>In cases of repeal, the underlying constitutional provision
    to be repealed must be examined</B>in order to determine
    whether the repealing and reenacting initiative contains a
    single subject. If a provision contains multiple subjects and
    an initiative proposes to repeal the entire underlying
    provision, then the initiative contains multiple subjects. On
    the other hand, if an initiative proposes anything less than a
    total repeal, it may satisfy the single-subject requirement. In
    re Proposed Initiative 1996-4, 916 P.2d 528 (Colo. 1996);
    disapproved in In re Ballot Title 2019-2020 No. 3, 2019 CO 57,

    <B>The single-subject requirement does not apply to municipal
    initiatives.</B>Bruce v. City of Colo. Springs, 200 P.3d 1140
    (Colo. App. 2008).</P>
    <P>
    <B>Title-setting board has no duty to advise
    proponents</B>concerning possible solutions to a single-subject
    violation. Comment by the board is within its sound discretion;
    requiring comment would unconstitutionally expand the board's
    authority and shift initiative-drafting responsibility from
    proponents to the board. In re Proposed Initiative 1996-4, 916
    P.2d 528 (Colo. 1996).</P>
    <P>If the title-setting board rejects an initiative for
    violating the single-subject requirement, then proponents may
    pursue one of two courses of action. They may either (1)
    commence a new review and comment process, or (2) present a
    revised title to the board. In re Proposed Initiative 1996-4,
    916 P.2d 528 (Colo. 1996).</P>
    <P>
    <B>Single-subject requirement for ballot initiatives
    met</B>where provisions in initiative make reference to the
    initiative's subject and the provisions are sufficiently
    connected to the subject. Matter of Title, Ballot Title, 917
    P.2d 292 (Colo. 1996).</P>
    <P>
    <B>An election provision in a measure does not constitute a
    separate subject if there is a sufficient connection between
    the provision and the subject of the initiative.</B>In re

    2000).</P>
    <P>
    <B>Title board is vested with considerable discretion in
    setting the title, ballot title and submission clause,</B>and
    summary. In reviewing actions of the title board, court must
    liberally construe the single-subject and title requirements

    <B>Proposed initiative contains only one subject.</B>Although
    initiative is comprehensive, all of its numerous provisions
    relate to the single subject of reforming petition rights and
    procedures. Matter of Petition for Amend. to Const., 907 P.2d
    586 (Colo. 1995).</P>
    <P>Proposed initiative that applies a $60 tax credit contains
    only one subject, even though it applies the credit to more
    than one tax and requires the state to replace monthly local
    government revenues lost because of the tax credit. Matter of
    Proposed Petition for an Amendment to the Constitution Adding

    <P>The texts of the initiatives encompass the single subject of
    gaming activities conducted by nonprofit organizations. The
    initiatives detail what games of chance may be conducted, who
    may conduct such games, and how such games may be conducted. In
    re Proposed Init. Bingo-Raffle Lic. (I), 915 P.2d 1320 (Colo.
    1996).</P>
    <P>Proposed initiative did not violate the single-subject
    requirement where "the public's interest in state waters" was
    sufficiently narrow and connected with both a "public trust
    doctrine" and the assignment of water use rights to the public
    or a watercourse. Matter of Title, Ballot Title, Sub. Clause,
    917 P.2d 1277 (Colo. 1996).</P>
    <P>Proposed initiative did not contain more than one subject
    merely because it provided for alternative ways to accomplish
    the same result. The alternate ways were related to and
    connected with each other and plainly did not violate the
    single-subject requirement. Matter of Proposed Initiative

    <P>Initiative that assessed fees for water pumped from beneath
    trust lands and then allocated the pumping fees for school

    P.3d 1 (Colo. 2000).</P>
    <P>Proposed initiative that employs a growth formula limiting
    the rate of future development, delineates a system of
    measurement to determine the "base developed" area of each
    jurisdiction, allows for alternative treatment of commenced but
    not completed projects, excludes low-income housing, public
    parks and open space, and historic landmarks, and establishes a
    procedure for exemptions does not violate the constitutional
    prohibition against single subjects. In re Ballot Title
    1999-2000 No. 235(a), 3 P.3d 1219 (Colo. 2000).</P>
    <P>Proposed initiative to amend the state constitution to give
    every county or municipality the right to limit housing growth
    by initiative and referendum subject to specified petition
    signature requirements, cap annual housing growth in ten
    specified counties at one percent per year for two years, and
    temporarily prohibit the issuance of building permits for new
    privately owned residential housing units in the same ten
    counties has a single subject of limiting housing growth in the
    state. In the Matter of the Title, Ballot Title &amp; Sub.

    <P>Proposed initiative that prohibits school districts from
    requiring schools to provide bilingual education programs while
    allowing parents to transfer children from an English immersion
    program to a bilingual program does not contain more than one
    subject. In re Ballot Title 1999-2000 No. 258(A), 4 P.3d 1094
    (Colo. 2000).</P>
    <P>Enforcement provision under which election will be declared
    void and revenues collected pursuant to election will be
    refunded is directly tied to initiative's purpose of
    eliminating pay-to-play contributions and, therefore, is not a
    separate subject. Clause in question should be interpreted as
    nothing more than an enforcement or implementation clause that
    does nothing more than incorporate inherent right of taxpayers
    to challenge tax, spending, or bond measures when they have
    standing to do so. Thus, enforcement provision is not a
    separate subject but rather is tied directly to initiative's
    single subject. In re Ballot Title 2005-2006 No. 73, 135 P.3d
    736 (Colo. 2006).</P>
    <P>Proposed initiative that creates a new legal regime, the
    Colorado public trust doctrine, to govern the public's rights
    in waters of natural streams contains a single subject. The
    proposed initiative does not contain an array of disconnected
    subjects joined together to garner support from various
    factions and does not contain surreptitious provisions that
    will surprise voters. In re Ballot Title 2011-2012 No. 3, 2012
    CO 25, 274 P.3d 562.</P>
    <P>Proposed initiative that modifies only the existing rights
    and interests in water between private individuals and the
    public is a cohesive proposal to create a new water regime and
    contains a single subject of public control of waters. Its
    provisions are necessarily and properly connected to each other
    because they define the purpose of the initiative, describe the
    broadened scope of the public's control over the state's water
    resources, and outline how to implement and enforce a new
    dominant public water estate. In re Ballot Title 2011-2012 No.

    <P>Proposed initiative that requires a statewide setback for
    new oil and gas development in this state and establishes that
    the statewide setback requirement is not a taking of private
    property under the state constitution contains a single
    subject. The "not a taking" provision applies only to the
    statewide setback requirement that would be established and is,
    therefore, properly connected to the requirement. In re Ballot

    approximate the payer's fair share of the costs incurred by the

    <P>Proposed initiative that establishes a fundamental right to
    a healthy environment contains a single subject. Provisions
    that broadly define the term "local government" require the
    state and local governments to assign protection of a healthy
    environment the highest priority, provide that when a state law
    and a local law address the same topic the law that is more
    protective of a healthy environment governs, and create a cause

    <P>One-sentence initiative to repeal in full the Taxpayer's
    Bill of Rights (TABOR) meets all of the requirements of a

    While TABOR itself is arguably a multi-subject provision,
    statements in prior state supreme court cases that an

    <P>
    <B>Proposed initiative contains more than one
    subject.</B>Citizen initiative that retroactively creates
    substantive fundamental rights in charter and constitutional
    amendments approved after 1990, requires the word "shall" in
    such amendments be mandatory regardless of the context,
    establishes standards for judicial review of filed petitions,
    provides that challenges to petitions can be upheld only if
    beyond a reasonable doubt by a unanimous supreme court, and
    contains other substantive and procedural provisions relating
    to recall, referendum, and initiative petitions contains more
    than one subject. Amendment to Const. Section 2 to Art. VII,
    900 P.2d 104 (Colo. 1995).</P>
    <P>Proposed initiative that establishes a tax credit and sets
    forth procedural requirements for future ballot titles contains
    more than one subject. Matter of Title, Ballot Title &amp; Sub.
    Cl., 900 P.2d 121 (Colo. 1995).</P>
    <P>Initiative that contains both tax cuts and mandatory
    reductions in state spending on state programs violates the
    single subject requirement. Matter of Title, Ballot Title for
    1997-98 No. 88, 961 P.2d 1106 (Colo. 1998).</P>
    <P>Proposed initiative that repealed the constitutional
    requirement that each judicial district have a minimum of one
    district court judge; deprived the city and county of Denver of
    control over Denver county court judgeships; immunized from
    liability persons who criticize a judicial officer regarding
    his or her qualifications; and altered the composition and
    powers of the commission on judicial discipline contains more
    than one subject. Matter of Title, Ballot Title for 1997-98 No.
    64, 960 P.2d 1192 (Colo. 1998); Matter of Title, Ballot Title
    for 1997-98 No. 95, 960 P.2d 1204 (Colo. 1998).</P>
    <P>Proposed initiative that also proposed to make all municipal
    court judges subject to its term of office and retention
    provisions and expanded the jurisdiction of the commission on
    judicial discipline to include municipal court judges contains
    more than one subject. Matter of Title, Ballot Title for
    1997-98 No. 95, 960 P.2d 1204 (Colo. 1998).</P>
    <P>Proposed initiative that creates a tax cut, imposes new
    criteria for voter approval of tax, spending, and debt
    increases, and imposes likely reductions in state spending on
    state programs contains at least three subjects. Matter of
    Title, Ballot Title &amp; Sub. Cl., &amp; Summary for 1999-2000
    No. 37, 977 P.2d 845 (Colo. 1999).</P>
    <P>Proposed initiative that creates a tax cut and imposes new
    criteria for voter approval of tax, spending, and debt
    increases contains multiple subjects. Matter of Title, Ballot
    Title &amp; Sub. Cl., &amp; Summary for 1999-2000 No. 38, 977
    P.2d 849 (Colo. 1999).</P>
    <P>Proposed initiative has more than single subject and,
    therefore, is unconstitutional. Initiative presents multiple
    subjects: (1) Time limits for tax measures; (2) time limits for
    public debt authorizations; and (3) time limits for
    voter-authorized relief from spending limits. While voters may
    well be receptive to a broadly applicable 10-year limitation
    upon the duration of any tax increases, they may not realize
    that they will be simultaneously limiting their ability to
    incur multiple-fiscal year district debt obligation to fund
    public projects. Voters would also be limiting prospectively
    the duration of all future ballot issues designed to provide
    relief from TABOR's wholly independent spending caps. Voters
    are entitled to have each of these separate subjects considered
    upon its own merits. In re Ballot Title 2005-2006 No. 74, 136
    P.3d 237 (Colo. 2006).</P>
    <P>Initiative that proposed the creation of a new Colorado
    department of environmental conservation and the creation of a
    mandatory public trust standard that would have required the
    department to resolve conflicts between economic interest and
    public ownership and public conservation values in lands,
    waters, public resources, and wildlife in favor of public
    ownerships and public values contained multiple subjects. In re
    Ballot Title 2007-2008 No. 17, 172 P.3d 871 (Colo. 2007).</P>
    <P>Initiative that comprehensively revamps constitutional
    recall provisions and allows recall of non-elected state and
    local officers contains more than one subject. In re Ballot
    Title 2013-2014 No. 76, 2014 CO 52, 333 P.3d 76.</P>
    <P>Initiative contains multiple subjects when its central theme
    is incorporating livestock into the animal cruelty statutes but
    it also includes a provision that redefines "sexual act with an
    animal" in a way that addresses the bodily integrity of all
    animals, not just livestock. In re Title, Ballot Title &amp;
    Submission Clause for 2021-2022 No. 16, 2021 CO 55, 489 P.3d
    1217.</P>
    <P>
    <B>Two proposed initiatives intended to modify the process for
    redistricting state legislative districts contained multiple
    subjects.</B>While the provisions of the proposed initiatives
    collectively constituted a single subject that would change the
    criteria to be used in drawing legislative districts;
    restructure the Colorado reapportionment commission; subject
    the restructured commission to open meetings and open records
    laws; require a two-thirds vote for commission action; modify
    the process for drafting, approval, and judicial review of
    redistricting plans; and allow the commission to adopt rules to
    govern its administration and operation, both initiatives also
    included a second subject of significantly changing the mission
    and role of the supreme court nominating commission by
    requiring it to recommend unaffiliated or minor party members
    to serve on the restructured reapportionment commission. In
    addition, one of the proposed initiatives also included a third
    subject of transferring the power to redistrict the state's
    congressional districts from the general assembly to a newly
    created redistricting commission. Title, Ballot Title &amp;

    <M>On rehearing by the title-setting board or review by the

    of the annotations to cases construing § 1-40-106 are not
    repeated here. Please see the annotations under § 1-40-106 for
    additional cases concerning the sufficiency of titles, and the

    compliance of the title-setting board with statutory

    <B>Subsection (1) allows an objector to bring only one motion
    for rehearing to challenge the titles set by the title
    board.</B>The title board properly denied an objector's second
    motion for rehearing based on lack of jurisdiction. In re
    Ballot Title 1999-2000 No. 219, 999 P.2d 819 (Colo. 2000).</P>
    <P>
    <B>The title board lacks jurisdiction to consider a motion for
    a second rehearing on a proposed initiative.</B>No matter what
    the decision of the title board at a rehearing is, the only
    recourse available to a person who objects to the decision is
    to petition the supreme court for review of the decision. In re
    Ballot Title 2019-2020 #74, 2020 CO 5, 455 P.3d 759.</P>
    <P>
    <B>This section provides a special statutory process that
    overrides claim preclusion or law of the case
    principles.</B>Consequently, the title board and the supreme
    court must review an initiative challenged under this section
    even if its language is identical to the language of a previous
    initiative. In re Ballot Title 2005-2006 No. 55, 138 P.3d 273
    (Colo. 2006).</P>
    <P>
    <B>In a proceeding under this statute: (1) the supreme court
    must not in any way concern itself with the merit or lack of
    merit of the proposed amendment since, under our system of
    government, that resolution rests with the electorate; (2) all
    legitimate presumptions must be indulged in favor of the
    propriety of the board's action; and (3) only in a clear case
    should a title prepared by the board be held invalid.</B>Bauch

    <P>In reviewing the board's title-setting process, the court
    does not address the merits of the proposed initiative and
    should not interpret the meaning of proposed language or
    suggest how it will be applied if adopted by the electorate;
    should resolve all legitimate presumptions in favor of the
    board; will not interfere with the board's choice of language
    if the language is not clearly misleading; and must ensure that
    the title, ballot title, submission clause, and summary fairly
    reflect the proposed initiative so that petition signers and
    voters will not be misled into support for or against a
    proposition by reason of the words employed by the board. In re
    Proposed Initiated Constitutional Amendment Concerning Limited
    Gaming in the Town of Burlington, 830 P.2d 1023 (Colo. 1992);
    Matter of Election Reform Amendment, 852 P.2d 28 (Colo. 1993);
    In re Proposed Initiative Concerning "Automobile Insurance
    Coverage", 877 P.2d 853 (Colo. 1994).</P>
    <P>Court will not address the merits of proposed initiatives
    nor interpret the meaning of proposed language. It is beyond
    the scope of the court's review to interpret or construe the
    language of a proposed initiative. In re Proposed Ballot
    Initiative on Parental Rights, 913 P.2d 1127 (Colo. 1996).</P>
    <P>So long as the language chosen by the board fairly
    summarizes the intent and meaning of the proposed amendment,
    without arguing for or against its adoption, it is sufficient.
    In re Proposed Ballot Initiative on Parental Rights, 913 P.2d
    1127 (Colo. 1996).</P>
    <P>The board is not required to state the effect that an
    initiative may have on other constitutional provisions and the
    initiative summary is not intended to fully educate people on
    all aspects of the proposed law. In re Proposed Ballot
    Initiative on Parental Rights, 913 P.2d 1127 (Colo. 1996).</P>
    <P>Court will not rewrite the titles or submission clause for
    the title board. Also, the court will reverse the title board's
    action in preparing the title or submission clause only if they
    contain a material and significant omission, misstatement, or
    misrepresentation. Matter of Title, Ballot Title for 1997-98
    No. 62, 961 P.2d 1077 (Colo. 1998).</P>
    <P>
    <B>And the mere fact that, after an appeal has been taken and a
    court has had the benefit of the additional labor bestowed upon
    the ballot title by counsel, a court may be able to write a
    better ballot title</B>than the one prepared by an attorney
    general constitutes no reason for discarding his title. Say v.
    Baker, 137 Colo. 155, 322 P.2d 317 (1958).</P>
    <P>
    <B>Because the purpose of an appeal is not to secure for the
    bill the best possible ballot title, but to eliminate one that
    is insufficient or unfair,</B>if it should develop that the one
    submitted by an attorney general is of that kind. Say v. Baker,
    137 Colo. 155, 322 P.2d 317 (1958); In re Branch Banking
    Initiative, 200 Colo. 85, 612 P.2d 96 (1980); Matter of Educ.
    Tax Reform, 823 P.2d 1353 (Colo. 1991).</P>
    <P>
    <B>Court's function limited.</B>It is not the function of the
    supreme court to rephrase the language of the summary and title
    in order to achieve the best possible statement of the intent
    of the amendment. In re Mineral Prod. Tax Initiative, 644 P.2d
    20 (Colo. 1982).</P>
    <P>Actions of the title setting review board will not be
    reversed just because a better title could have been adopted.

    Concerning Suits Against Nongovernmental Employers Who
    Knowingly and Recklessly Maintain an Unsafe Work Environment,
    898 P.2d 1071 (Colo. 1995).</P>
    <P>
    <B>Review limited to whether intent of initiative properly
    reflected.</B>On review, the supreme court can only consider
    whether the titles, summary, and submission clause reflect the
    intent of the initiative, not whether they reflect all possible
    problems that may arise in the future in applying the language
    of the proposed initiative. In re Proposed Initiative on
    Transf. of Real Estate, 200 Colo. 40, 611 P.2d 981 (1980); In
    re Title Pertaining to Sale of Table Wine in Grocery Stores,

    <P>
    <B>And interpretation of initiative not permitted.</B>It is not
    the function of the supreme court in the review proceeding, nor
    is it the board's function, to determine the meaning of the
    language of the initiative: A judicial interpretation of the
    meaning of the initiative must await an adjudication in a
    specific factual context. Spelts v. Klausing, 649 P.2d 303
    (Colo. 1982); In re Proposed Initiative on Parental
    Notification of Abortions for Minors, 794 P.2d 238 (Colo.

    <P>Court will not rewrite the titles or submission clause for
    the title board. Also, the court will reverse the title board's

    <P>
    <B>Title language employed by the title board will be
    rejected</B>only if it is misleading, inaccurate or fails to
    reflect the central features of the proposed measure. In re
    Ballot Title 1999-2000 No. 215 (Prohibiting Certain Open Pit
    Mining), 3 P.3d 11 (Colo. 2000).</P>
    <P>
    <B>Title, ballot title, and submission clause of an initiative
    measure were not unfair or misleading where a term was not
    defined that would have required detailed statutory
    explanation.</B>The board's omission of a definition in its
    title and summary is not an abuse of discretion where the
    definition is complex and would be impossible to define within
    the title and summary of the initiative without a detailed
    statutory explanation, even though the term is obscure and not
    within the common knowledge of most voters. Matter of Title,
    Ballot Title for 1997-98 No. 75, 960 P.2d 672 (Colo. 1998).</P>
    <P>
    <B>Title set by the title board was misleading and inaccurate
    and would be modified</B>where the intent of the proposed
    measure was to prohibit the modification of certain mining
    permits to allow the expansion of mining operations but the
    title could be construed as prohibiting the expansion of mining
    operations under an existing, unmodified mining permit. In re
    Ballot Title 1999-2000 No. 215 (Prohibiting Certain Open Pit
    Mining), 3 P.3d 11 (Colo. 2000).</P>
    <P>
    <B>Issues of whether initiative violated article X, section 20,
    of the Colorado Constitution are premature and the court will
    not address them</B>since that determination would necessarily
    require the court to interpret its language or predict its
    application if adopted by the electorate. Matter of Proposed
    Initiative 1997-98 No. 10, 943 P.2d 897 (Colo. 1997).</P>
    <P>
    <B>Although this section provides for supreme court review of
    citizen initiatives before they are submitted to the general
    electorate,</B>it does not confer jurisdiction on the supreme
    court to review the constitutionality of legislative referenda
    prior to enactment. Thus, the supreme court lacked jurisdiction
    to review a legislative referendum for compliance with the
    single-subject requirement prior to enactment of the
    referendum. Polhill v. Buckley, 923 P.2d 119 (Colo. 1996).</P>
    <P>
    <B>Judicial determination of retroactive application of
    proposed amendment.</B>If a controversy arises in a specific
    factual context, then judicial determination of retroactive
    application may be appropriate, but it is not relevant to the
    determination of the accuracy of the language of the titles,
    summary, and submission clause of a proposed amendment. In re
    Proposed Initiative on Transf. of Real Estate, 200 Colo. 40,
    611 P.2d 981 (1980); In re Proposed Initiative on
    Confidentiality of Adoption Records, 832 P.2d 229 (Colo.
    1992).</P>
    <P>Where a proposed amendment uses the term "strong public
    trust doctrine" but does not define it, such a definition must
    await future judicial construction and cannot appropriately be
    included in the title or submission clause. In re Proposed
    Initiative on Water Rights, 877 P.2d 321 (Colo. 1994).</P>
    <P>The board is not required to state the effect that an
    initiative may have on other constitutional provisions, and the
    court may not address the potential constitutional
    interpretation implications of the initiative in the court's
    review. In re Proposed Initiative on Water Rights, 877 P.2d 321
    (Colo. 1994).</P>
    <P>
    <B>As a general rule, court will reject the board's actions
    only where the language it has adopted is so inaccurate as to
    clearly mislead the electorate.</B>In re Petition on Campaign
    &amp; Political Fin., 877 P.2d 311 (Colo. 1994).</P>
    <P>
    <B>Burden for invalidating an amendment because of an alleged
    misleading ballot title, after adoption by the people in a
    general election, is heavy</B>since the general assembly has
    provided procedures for challenging a ballot title prior to
    elections. Unless the challengers to the amendment can prove
    that so many voters were actually misled by the title that the
    result of the election might have been different, the challenge
    will fail. City of Glendale v. Buchanan, 195 Colo. 267, 578
    P.2d 221 (1978).</P>
    <P>
    <B>In considering whether the title, ballot title and
    submission clause, and summary accurately reflect the intent of
    the proposed initiative, it is appropriate to consider the
    testimony of the proponent concerning the intent of the
    proposed initiative</B>that was offered at the public meeting
    at which the title, ballot title and submission clause, and
    summary were set. In re Proposed Initiated Constitutional
    Amendment Concerning Unsafe Workplace Env't, 830 P.2d 1031
    (Colo. 1992).</P>
    <P>
    <B>Once petitioners file their petitions for review with the
    supreme court pursuant to subsection (2), the board loses
    jurisdiction to make substantive changes to the titles and
    summary.</B>The board properly refused to consider a motion for
    rehearing filed by one opponent that raised substantive issues
    when the other opponents had already filed petitions for review
    with the supreme court; any action by the board to make
    substantive changes to the summary after the matter was before
    the supreme court on review would impermissibly intrude on the
    court's jurisdiction over the case. In re Ballot Title
    1999-2000 No. 255, 4 P.3d 485 (Colo. 2000).</P>
    <P>
    <B>The time for filing an appeal to a decision of the title
    board is five days after the board denies the motion for
    rehearing</B>and not five days from the date the secretary of
    state certifies the documents requested for appeal. Five days
    from the board's denial of a motion for rehearing is final
    action by the board regardless of whether an appeal is filed.
    Matter of Title, Ballot Title for 1997-98 No. 62, 961 P.2d 1077
    (Colo. 1998).</P>
    <P>For a timely appeal, it must be filed within five days from
    the board's denial of a motion for rehearing and must be
    construed with C.A.R. 26, thus clarifying the computation of
    five days to exclude Saturday and Sunday. Matter of Title,
    Ballot Title for 1997-98 No. 62, 961 P.2d 1077 (Colo.
    1998).</P>
    <P>
    <B>Initiative proponents may circulate petitions for
    signatures</B>after the title board has taken its final action
    in regard to the ballot titles and summary, pursuant to
    subsections (1) and (5), and while an appeal of that action to
    the supreme court is pending pursuant to subsection (2).
    Setting of titles and summary becomes a final title board
    action upon denial of a rehearing petition or upon expiration
    of the time for filing a rehearing petition with the title
    board. Armstrong v. Davidson, 10 P.3d 1278 (Colo. 2000).</P>
    <P>
    <B>Objector may not raise in a second motion for rehearing a
    challenge that the objector could have raised in the first
    motion for rehearing.</B>Case-by-case analysis of the interests
    involved in setting the titles to an initiative is not
    required. In re Ballot Title 1999-2000 No. 215, 3 P.3d 447
    (Colo. 2000).</P>
    <P>
    <B>Judicial review of abstract authorized.</B>This section
    authorizes the state supreme court to review the title board's
    final decision regarding a fiscal impact statement abstract
    prepared pursuant to § 1-40-105.5. And the court applies the
    same standard of review when reviewing an abstract as it
    applies when reviewing the title board's single-subject and
    clear-title findings by: (1) giving great deference to the
    title board; (2) drawing all legitimate presumptions in favor
    of the title board's decision; and (3) only overturning the
    board's decision in a clear case. In the Matter of the Title,

    <M>REQUIRED DATA.</M></AN-DIV>
    <ANNO-TEXT>
    <B>The purpose of the required data</B>is that those interested
    in protesting may be apprised of that which will enable them
    conveniently to check the petition. Haraway v. Armstrong, 95
    Colo. 398, 36 P.2d 456 (1934). 
    <P>
    <B>And therefore, the careful entry of the residence (not mere
    post-office address) of each person with each name should be
    made</B>at the time of the signing, and should show, in all
    cities and towns where there are street numbers, the street
    number of the residence of the signer. Elkins v. Milliken, 80
    Colo. 135, 249 P. 655 (1926).</P>
    <P>
    <B>This is a very important provision.</B>Elkins v. Milliken,
    80 Colo. 135, 249 P. 655 (1926).</P>
    <P>
    <B>And it is the most efficient provision against fraud</B>in
    this section. Elkins v. Milliken, 80 Colo. 135, 249 P. 655
    (1926).</P>
    <P>
    <B>Also it is essential to an intelligent protest</B>and should
    always be carefully obeyed. Elkins v. Milliken, 80 Colo. 135,
    249 P. 655 (1926).</P>
    <P>
    <B>And the entry of the date of the signature</B>is only less
    important. Elkins v. Milliken, 80 Colo. 135, 249 P. 655
    (1926).</P>
    <P>
    <B>But both residence and date of the signature are
    mandatory</B>by the provisions of § 1 of art. V, Colo. Const.
    Elkins v. Milliken, 80 Colo. 135, 249 P. 655 (1926).</P>
    <P>
    <B>Therefore, signatures to a petition, where the signer's
    residence can be identified by street and number, should be
    rejected if these are lacking.</B>Miller v. Armstrong, 84 Colo.
    416, 270 P. 877 (1928).</P>
    <P>
    <B>But the residence and date of signing may be added</B>by a
    person other than the petitioner. Haraway v. Armstrong, 95
    Colo. 398, 36 P.2d 456 (1934).</P>
    <P>
    <B>Because neither the constitution nor this section
    specifically requires</B>the signer to add his address and date
    of signing. Haraway v. Armstrong, 95 Colo. 398, 36 P.2d 456
    (1934).</P>
    <P>
    <B>Such additions, although preferably done by the
    petitioner,</B>may be done by another. Haraway v. Armstrong, 95
    Colo. 398, 36 P.2d 456 (1934).</P>
    <P>
    <B>And failure of signers to insert residences is not ground
    for rejection.</B>There is nothing in the constitution,
    statutes, or decisions justifying the rejection of signatures
    solely by reasons of the failure of signers, under the
    circumstances prevailing, to insert in the petition streets and
    numbers of their residences. Case v. Morrison, 118 Colo. 517,
    197 P.2d 621 (1948).</P>
    <P>
    <B>And also omission of year from date petition signed was held
    immaterial.</B>In considering the sufficiency of a petition,
    the fact that the year is omitted from the date upon which a
    signer affixed his signature to the petition is immaterial,
    where the document as a whole conclusively establishes the year
    in which the petition was signed. Haraway v. Armstrong, 95
    Colo. 398, 36 P.2d 456 (1934), distinguishing Miller v.
    Armstrong, 84 Colo. 416, 270 P. 877 (1928).</P>
    <P>
    <B>Moreover, until filed with the secretary of state, a
    petition for the initiation of a law is in no sense a public
    document,</B>and may be checked and corrected by the sponsors
    before filing. Haraway v. Armstrong, 95 Colo. 398, 36 P.2d 456
    (1934).</P>
    <P>
    <B>Computation of residency applicable for municipal
    referendum.</B>Computation of residency by looking to the date
    of signature and then to the date of the prospective election
    to determine whether the durational requirement is satisfied is
    applicable to a municipal referendum residency requirement.
    Francis v. Rogers, 182 Colo. 430, 514 P.2d 311
    (1973).</P></ANNO-TEXT>

    <N></N>SIGNATURES.</AN-DIV>
    <ANNO-TEXT>
    <B>Initiative petition signatures must be collected in
    person</B>even when a disaster emergency has been declared in
    response to a global pandemic. Provisions of article V, section
    1 (6), of the state constitution requiring that petitions be
    signed by registered electors in their proper persons and that
    signatures be verified by another registered elector must be
    read together to require in-person signing in the presence of a
    petition circulator. The Colorado Disaster Emergency Act
    authorizes the governor to suspend certain types of statutes,
    rules, and regulations during a declared disaster emergency but
    does not authorize the suspension of constitutional provisions,
    and the governor therefore cannot issue an executive order
    allowing initiative petition signatures to be collected by mail
    or email. Ritchie v. Polis, 2020 CO 69, 467 P.3d 339. 
    <P>
    <B>Where two or more signatures on a petition are in the same
    handwriting, all such must be rejected.</B>Miller v. Armstrong,
    84 Colo. 416, 270 P. 877 (1928).</P>
    <P>
    <B>So also where sections of a petition have been tampered with
    after the signatures</B>have been affixed thereto, they must be
    rejected. Miller v. Armstrong, 84 Colo. 416, 270 P. 877
    (1928).</P>
    <P>
    <B>Newspaper pages cut and reassembled for inclusion in
    petition.</B>Where newspaper pages, on which were printed
    petition forms in three parts which were used to secure
    signatures in support of a petition to place a proposed
    constitutional amendment on the ballot, were cut into the
    separate parts and then reassembled and bound together for
    inclusion in the petition presented to the secretary of state,
    this procedure did not invalidate the signatures since there
    was no showing or intimation that the separation of the forms
    involved any alteration, irregularity, or fraud. Billings v.
    Buchanan, 192 Colo. 32, 555 P.2d 176 (1976).</P></ANNO-TEXT>

    <N></N>CIRCULATORS.</AN-DIV>
    <ANNO-TEXT>
    <B>Since there was little in the record to support plaintiffs'
    claim that the affidavit requirement in subsection (2)
    significantly burdens political expression by decreasing the
    pool of available circulators, exacting scrutiny is not
    required.</B>Am. Constitutional Law Found., Inc. v. Meyer, 120
    F.3d 1092 (10th Cir. 1997), aff'd on other grounds, 525 U.S.
    182, 119 S. Ct. 636, 142 L. Ed. 2d 599 (1999). 
    <P>
    <B>Given the responsibility circulators bear in ensuring the
    integrity of elections involving ballot issues,</B>and given
    the fact that the affidavit requirement is a reasonable,
    nondiscriminatory restriction, subsection (2) is not unduly
    burdensome and unconstitutionally vague. Am. Constitutional Law
    Found., Inc. v. Meyer, 120 F.3d 1092 (10th Cir. 1997), aff'd on
    other grounds, 525 U.S. 182, 119 S. Ct. 636, 142 L. Ed. 2d 599
    (1999).</P>
    <P>
    <B>The requirements of this section are justified by the
    state's compelling need for the names and addresses of the
    circulators and the requirement is sufficiently narrowly drawn
    to be constitutional.</B>The affidavit requirement has the
    primary purpose of providing the opportunity for an adequate
    hearing on the sufficiency of the signatures for the petition
    for other matters relevant to placing the measure on the
    ballot. There is a compelling necessity to be able to summon
    circulators to provide testimony at a hearing on challenges to
    the validity of the signatures and for other matters relevant
    to the petitioning process. Am. Constitutional Law Found., Inc.
    v. Meyer, 870 F. Supp. 995 (D. Colo. 1994), aff'd on other
    grounds, 120 F.3d 1092 (10th Cir. 1997), aff'd on other
    grounds, 525 U.S. 182, 119 S. Ct. 636, 142 L. Ed. 2d 599
    (1999).</P>
    <P>
    <B>Subsection (2)(b)(I)(C) does not severely burden first
    amendment rights.</B>Because subsection (2)(b)(I)(C) does not
    contain a residency requirement, it does not restrict
    non-resident circulators from signature-gathering activities.
    Independence Inst. v. Gessler, 869 F. Supp. 2d 1289 (D. Colo.
    2012).</P>
    <P>
    <B>"Read and understand" requirement is a formal requirement to
    which the court will not apply strict scrutiny in a
    constitutional challenge:</B>Although requirements limit the
    power of initiative, the limitation is not substantive. Loonan
    v. Woodley, 882 P.2d 1380 (Colo. 1994).</P>
    <P>
    <B>"Read and understand" requirement enhances the integrity of
    the election process and does not unconstitutionally infringe
    on the right to petition.</B>Loonan v. Woodley, 882 P.2d 1380
    (Colo. 1994).</P>
    <P>
    <B>"Read and understand" requirement is not unconstitutionally
    vague.</B>Loonan v. Woodley, 882 P.2d 1380 (Colo. 1994).</P>
    <P>
    <B>Subsection (2) is sufficiently definite because it
    explicitly endorses the lay circulator's own interpretation of
    "understanding",</B>and does not invest law enforcement
    officers with sweeping, unrestrained discretion. Am.
    Constitutional Law Found., Inc. v. Meyer, 120 F.3d 1092 (10th
    Cir. 1997), aff'd on other grounds, 525 U.S. 182, 119 S. Ct.
    636, 142 L. Ed. 2d 599 (1999).</P>
    <P>
    <B>The requirement in subsections (2)(a) and (3)(a) that
    circulators make themselves available in the event of a protest
    does not burden first amendment rights.</B>The state has a
    strong interest in maintaining the integrity of the petition
    process. Independence Inst. v. Gessler, 869 F. Supp. 2d 1289
    (D. Colo. 2012).</P>
    <P>
    <B>Omission of required affidavit language</B>demonstrated that
    circulators of the petition did not read and understand the
    statute as required by this section. Loonan v. Woodley, 882
    P.2d 1380 (Colo. 1994).</P>
    <P>
    <B>The circulator of a petition for the initiation of a measure
    can make a positive affidavit that a signature thereon is
    genuine</B>by reason of its having been written in his presence
    or through his familiarity with the signer's handwriting, the
    pertinent law requiring only that the affidavit state that each
    signature is the signature of the person whose name it purports
    to be. Brownlow v. Wunch, 103 Colo. 120, 83 P.2d 775
    (1938).</P>
    <P>
    <B>But this section makes it a felony</B>for one person to sign
    for another. Miller v. Armstrong, 84 Colo. 416, 270 P. 877
    (1928).</P>
    <P>
    <B>And a circulator who makes oath to the genuineness of such
    signatures, if done with knowledge, is guilty of
    perjury.</B>Miller v. Armstrong, 84 Colo. 416, 270 P. 877
    (1928).</P>
    <P>
    <B>Since "purport" means to have the appearance or convey the
    impression of being.</B>Brownlow v. Wunch, 103 Colo. 120, 83
    P.2d 775 (1938).</P>
    <P>
    <B>And in a proceeding to determine the sufficiency of a
    petition,</B>the contention that portions of the petition,
    although not vulnerable otherwise, should be discarded because
    circulators, as shown by other sections, had so deported
    themselves that they were unworthy of belief, overruled.
    Haraway v. Armstrong, 95 Colo. 398, 36 P.2d 456 (1934).</P>
    <P>
    <B>Substantial compliance is the standard the court must apply
    in assessing the effect of the deficiencies that caused the
    district court to hold petition signatures invalid.</B>Fabec v.
    Beck, 922 P.2d 330 (Colo. 1996).</P>
    <P>
    <B>Discrepancies in the day or month of the circulator's date
    of signing and the date of notary acknowledgment render the
    relevant petitions invalid</B>absent evidence that explains the
    differences in question. Petitions containing such
    discrepancies do not provide the necessary safeguards against
    abuse and fraud in the initiative process. Fabec v. Beck, 922
    P.2d 330 (Colo. 1996).</P>
    <P>
    <B>Absent evidence that the change in signing was the product
    of the signing party, changes to a circulator's signing date do
    not represent substantial compliance with subsection (2) and
    serve to invalidate the signatures within the affected
    petitions.</B>The district court properly held invalid
    signatures that were tainted by a change in the circulator's
    date of signing, where the date of signing was not accompanied
    by the initials of the circulator or other evidence in the
    record establishing that the circulator made the change. Fabec
    v. Beck, 922 P.2d 330 (Colo. 1996).</P>
    <P>
    <B>The district court erred in invalidating petitions that did
    not contain a notary seal.</B>The purpose of the notarized
    affidavit provision in subsection (2) was substantially
    achieved despite the proponents' failure to secure a notary
    seal on petitions affecting 92 signatures. The record contains
    evidence that the affidavits with omitted seals were notarized
    by individuals with the same signature and commission
    expiration found on other affidavits with proper seals. Fabec
    v. Beck, 922 P.2d 330 (Colo. 1996).</P>
    <P>
    <B>The initiative proponents substantially complied with the
    requirements for a circulator's affidavit even though the
    circulator did not include a date of signing.</B>When the
    circulator simply omits the date of signing, there is no reason
    to believe that the affidavit was not both subscribed and sworn
    to before the notary public on the date indicated in the jurat.

  <M>In Independence Institute v. Gessler, 936 F. Supp. 2d 1256 (D.
  Colo. 2013), the United States District Court for the District of

  permanently enjoined the Colorado Secretary of State from
  enforcing subsection (4) and any ancillary provision that
  enforces subsection (4), namely, sections 1-40-135 and 1-40-121,
  to the extent those sections apply to the restrictions on

    <B>Identification badge requirement violates the first and
    fourteenth amendments to the United States constitution.</B>The
    requirement substantially affects the number of potential
    petition circulators which translates into a corresponding
    decrease in the amount of protected political speech. The
    state's articulated interests, an interest in honesty in public
    discussion of governmental issues and in demonstrating
    grassroots support for an initiative, are not compelling and
    the restriction has not been narrowly drawn to further those
    interests. Am. Constitutional Law Found., Inc. v. Meyer, 870 F.
    Supp. 995 (D. Colo. 1994), aff'd on other grounds, 120 F.3d

    <B>Because the requirement in subsection (1) that circulators
    be registered voters is not narrowly tailored to a compelling
    state interest, it unconstitutionally impinges on free

    <P>
    <B>The age requirement is a neutral restriction that imposes
    only a temporary disability-it does not establish an absolute
    prohibition</B>but merely postpones the opportunity to
    circulate petitions. Exacting scrutiny is not required. Because
    maturity is reasonably related to Colorado's interest in
    preserving the integrity of ballot issue elections, the first
    amendment challenge fails. Am. Constitutional Law Found., Inc.

    <P>
    <B>Subsection (2) is not narrowly tailored to serve the state's
    interest.</B>Conditioning circulation upon wearing an
    identification badge is a broad intrusion, discouraging
    truthful, accurate speech by those unwilling to wear a badge,
    and applying regardless of the character or strength of an
    individual's interest in anonymity. Additionally, the badges
    are but one part of the state's comprehensive scheme to combat
    circulation fraud. Article 40 of title 1 provides other tools
    that are much more narrowly tailored to serve the state's
    interest. Am. Constitutional Law Found., Inc. v. Meyer, 120
    F.3d 1092 (10th Cir. 1997), aff'd on other grounds, 525 U.S.

    <P>
    <B>The limitation in subsection (4) on per-signature
    compensation for petition circulators violates the first
    amendment of the United States constitution.</B>Subsection (4)
    will deter most itinerant professionals from working in the
    state; eliminate low-volume professional circulators; and
    significantly increase the costs of a signature-gathering
    campaign. Independence Inst. v. Gessler, 936 F. Supp. 2d 1256
    (D. Colo. 2013).</P>
    <P>The cost increase associated with subsection (4) is likely
    to lower the chances of underfunded proponents succeeding in
    the initiative and referendum process. Independence Inst. v.
    Gessler, 936 F. Supp. 2d 1256 (D. Colo. 2013).</P>
    <P>The effect of subsection (4) will be the exclusion from the
    initiative process of those who, through experience and
    self-selection, are the most efficient and effective
    circulators. Independence Inst. v. Gessler, 936 F. Supp. 2d
    1256 (D. Colo. 2013).</P>
    <P>To the extent subsection (4) prevents proponents from using
    individuals who would most effectively convey their message to
    the public, the statute places a substantial burden on the
    proponents' first amendment rights, even if the statute only
    restricts proponents from using some, but not all, circulators.
    Independence Inst. v. Gessler, 936 F. Supp. 2d 1256 (D. Colo.
    2013).</P>
    <P>Given the availability of other effective and less
    burdensome statutory tools to safeguard the state's interest in
    reducing fraud and the number of invalid petition signatures,
    subsection (4) poses an undue restriction on first amendment
    rights. Independence Inst. v. Gessler, 936 F. Supp. 2d 1256 (D.
    Colo. 2013).</P>
    <P>
    <B>The secretary of state is permanently enjoined from
    enforcing subsection (4)</B>and any ancillary statute that
    enforces subsection (4), namely, §§ 1-40-135 and 1-40-121 to
    the extent that those sections apply to the restriction on
    per-signature compensation found in subsection (4).
    Independence Inst. v. Gessler, 936 F. Supp. 2d 1256 (D. Colo.
    2013).</P>
    <P>
    <B>All circulators of initiative petitions must be registered
    electors,</B>as required in both section 1 of article V of the
    state constitution and this section. Although the secretary of
    state was at one time enjoined by federal action from enforcing
    this requirement, after the injunction was lifted, she properly
    disallowed petitions circulated by nonregistered voters.
    McClellan v. Meyer, 900 P.2d 24 (Colo. 1995).</P>
    <P>
    <B>Training requirement is not a severe burden on first
    amendment rights.</B>In instituting the training program, this
    state has a significant interest in ensuring that petition
    entities are knowledgeable about state law in order to inform
    paid or unpaid circulators about the state's statutory
    requirements. Independence Inst. v. Gessler, 869 F. Supp. 2d

  secretary of state has failed to issue a statement of sufficiency
  within thirty calendar days, no further agency action is
  necessary for the district court to have jurisdiction to consider
  the protest. During the period a petition is being examined by
  the secretary of state for sufficiency, the petition shall not be
  available to the public; except that such period must not exceed
  thirty calendar days. Immediately after the secretary of state
  issues a statement of sufficiency or, if the petition is deemed
  sufficient because the secretary of state has failed to issue the
  statement, after thirty calendar days, the secretary of state
  shall make the petition available to the public for copying upon

  the secretary of state in the verification of the petition or the
  grounds for challenging individual signatures or petition
  sections, as well as individual signatures or petition sections
  protested. If the secretary of state verified each name on the
  petition sections, the protest shall set forth with particularity
  the grounds of the protest and the individual signatures or

  <P N="(2)(b)">(b)
  <M>Regardless of the method used by the secretary of state to
  verify signatures, the grounds for challenging individual
  signatures or petition sections pursuant to paragraph (a) of this
  subsection (2) shall include, but are not limited to, the use of
  a petition form that does not comply with the provisions of this
  article, fraud, and a violation of any provision of this article
  or any other law that, in either case, prevents fraud, abuse, or
  mistake in the petition process.</M></P>
  <P N="(2)(c)">(c)

  <M>A registered elector who files a protest shall be entitled to

    <M>SPECIFICATION OF</M>
    <NL></NL>GROUNDS AND OATH.</AN-DIV>
    <ANNO-TEXT>
    <B>The provisions of this section that a protest to a petition
    for the submission of an act of the general assembly to the
    people must specify the grounds of such protest, and be under
    oath, are jurisdictional.</B>Ramer v. Wright, 62 Colo. 53, 159
    P. 1145 (1916); Brownlow v. Wunch, 103 Colo. 120, 83 P.2d 775
    (1938). 
    <P>
    <B>And the secretary of state is without power to act</B>in the
    absence of a substantial compliance therewith. Ramer v. Wright,
    62 Colo. 53, 159 P. 1145 (1916); Brownlow v. Wunch, 103 Colo.
    120, 83 P.2d 775 (1938).</P>
    <P>
    <B>There was not a substantial compliance</B>where, appended to
    a protest, appeared the certificate of a notary public that
    certain persons each "deposes and says: That he subscribed the
    above protest after reading the same, and the contents thereof
    are true to the best of his knowledge, information and belief",
    but there was no statement that the persons named were sworn.
    Therefore, the secretary had no authority to entertain the
    protest. Ramer v. Wright, 62 Colo. 53, 159 P. 1145 (1916).</P>
    <P>
    <B>The requirement that the protest must be under oath</B>is
    not so unreasonable as to invalidate the statute. Ramer v.
    Wright, 62 Colo. 53, 159 P. 1145 (1916).</P></ANNO-TEXT>

    <M>AMENDED PROTEST.</M></AN-DIV>
    <ANNO-TEXT>
    <B>Whether a protest should specify the names protested was not
    determined</B>in Elkins v. Milliken, 80 Colo. 135, 249 P. 655
    (1926). 
    <P>
    <B>Amended protest was properly dismissed by the secretary of
    state despite the secretary's incorrect notification</B>to the
    protestor that a protest could be filed by a specified date.
    The secretary of state lacked the authority to enlarge the
    protest period provided in former version of this section, and
    protestor cannot state claim for relief under theory of
    estoppel against a state entity on the basis of an unauthorized
    action or promise. Montero v. Meyer, 795 P.2d 242 (Colo. 1990)
    (decided under law in effect prior to 1989 amendment).</P>
    <P>
    <B>Petitioners properly sought district court review under this
    section and § 1-40-119 without first pursuing the
    administrative remedies outlined in § 1-40-132 (1).</B>Section
    1-40-132 (1) is inapplicable to determination whether a
    petition has a sufficient number of valid signatures to qualify
    for placement of an initiated measure on the ballot. Fabec v.
    Beck, 922 P.2d 330 (Colo. 1996).</P></ANNO-TEXT>

    <NL></NL>SECRETARY OF STATE.</AN-DIV>
    <ANNO-TEXT>
    <B>Where a petition is protested before the secretary of
    state,</B>that official in making findings should specify the
    names or categories of names which should be rejected. Miller
    v. Armstrong, 84 Colo. 416, 270 P. 877 (1928). 
    <P>
    <B>The secretary of state improperly applied the perfect match
    rule</B>in disallowing signatures where there was a discrepancy
    between the street directional or apartment number as they
    appeared on the petition and the master voting list. This
    information is not required under the statute and is therefore
    extraneous. McClellan v. Meyer, 900 P.2d 24 (Colo. 1995).</P>
    <P>The secretary of state also erred in disallowing signatures
    based on discrepancies between the name of the town as included
    with the signature and as stated on the master voting list
    where the secretary had actual knowledge that the discrepancies
    were a result of the creation of a town that occurred after
    preparation of the master voting list. McClellan v. Meyer, 900
    P.2d 24 (Colo. 1995).</P>
    <P>
    <B>The secretary of state properly disallowed
    signatures</B>when the signer indicated or omitted a
    designation of junior or senior that was omitted from or
    included on the master list. McClellan v. Meyer, 900 P.2d 24
    (Colo. 1995).</P>
    <P>
    <B>Where an elector moves to a new residence and retains the
    same post office box as a mailing address,</B>the signature
    should be rejected unless the elector is registered at a post
    office address and the post office address is the only address
    assigned to a particular residence. McClellan v. Meyer, 900
    P.2d 24 (Colo. 1995).</P></ANNO-TEXT>

    <M>REMEDY PROVIDED.</M></AN-DIV>
    <ANNO-TEXT>
    <B>This section provides one special remedy and only one,</B>a
    judicial review of "the findings as to the sufficiency" of the
    petition. Robinson v. Armstrong, 90 Colo. 363, 9 P.2d 481
    (1932). 
    <P>
    <B>However, this remedy is not compulsory.</B>Robinson v.
    Armstrong, 90 Colo. 363, 9 P.2d 481 (1932).</P>
    <P>
    <B>The parties may waive it,</B>or abandon or dismiss it after
    beginning it. Robinson v. Armstrong, 90 Colo. 363, 9 P.2d 481
    (1932).</P>
    <P>
    <B>But where a petition is protested before the secretary of
    state, after whose decision the matter is taken into
    court,</B>the case is before the court for review and not for
    trial de novo. Miller v. Armstrong, 84 Colo. 416, 270 P. 877
    (1928).</P>
    <P>
    <B>And on dismissal of such an action, an order of the trial
    court</B>that the petition be returned to the secretary of
    state is proper. Robinson v. Armstrong, 90 Colo. 363, 9 P.2d
    481 (1932).</P>
    <P>
    <B>If, based on a random sample, the secretary of state issues
    a good faith determination of insufficiency and a timely
    protest establishes that the petition contains more than 90
    <N></N>% but less than 110 % of the required signatures,</B>the
    secretary of state is required to conduct a line-by-line
    examination of each signature. The results of the line-by-line
    count are subject to the protest and appeal process provided in
    this section. Buckley v. Chilcutt, 968 P.2d 112 (Colo.
    1998).</P></ANNO-TEXT>
    <AN-DIV>VI.
    <M>EFFECT ON OTHER TRIBUNALS.</M></AN-DIV>
    <ANNO-TEXT>
    <B>This section sets up a special procedure for protesting
    petitions</B>for the initiation of measures. Brownlow v. Wunch,
    102 Colo. 447, 80 P.2d 444 (1938). 
    <P>
    <B>But it does not deprive courts of equity of
    jurisdiction</B>in such cases. Brownlow v. Wunch, 102 Colo.
    447, 80 P.2d 444 (1938).</P>
    <P>And the statutory procedure outlined has no application to
    actions in equity courts. Brownlow v. Wunch, 102 Colo. 447, 80
    P.2d 444 (1938).</P>
    <P>This section does not provide an exclusive and adequate
    remedy so as to deprive equity courts of jurisdiction. Elkins
    v. Milliken, 80 Colo. 135, 249 P. 655 (1926).</P>
    <P>
    <B>Section inapplicable to actions in court.</B>The provisions
    of this section concerning the sufficiency of petitions for the
    initiation of laws have no application to action in court.
    Elkins v. Milliken, 80 Colo. 135, 249 P. 655 (1926).</P>
    <P>
    <B>And courts may interfere in matters preliminary to
    elections,</B>such as determining the validity of a petition to
    initiate a measure. Elkins v. Milliken, 80 Colo. 135, 249 P.
    655 (1926).</P>
    <P>
    <B>Proceedings before the secretary of state to determine the
    validity of a petition to initiate a measure is not another
    suit pending</B>so as to oust a court of jurisdiction in an
    action to enjoin the placing of the measure on the ballot. And,
    where it does not appear on the face of a complaint that there
    is another suit pending, such objection may not be raised by
    demurrer. Elkins v. Milliken, 80 Colo. 135, 249 P. 655
    (1926).</P></ANNO-TEXT>
    <AN-DIV>VII.
    <N></N>INJUNCTION FOR FRAUD.</AN-DIV>
    <ANNO-TEXT>
    <B>Fraud may be the basis of an injunction</B>against the
    submission of the subject of the petition to vote, which
    submission is also a preliminary of the election. Leckenby v.
    Post Printing &amp; Publ'g Co., 65 Colo. 443, 176 P. 490
    (1918); Elkins v. Milliken, 80 Colo. 135, 249 P. 655 (1926). 
    <P>And if we do not hold in this way, we shall be compelled to
    say that if a petition with a sufficient number of names, on
    its face valid, should be laid before the secretary of state,
    it could not be successfully attacked even though every name
    were forged and every affidavit attached to it were false.
    Leckenby v. Post Printing &amp; Publ'g Co., 65 Colo. 443, 176
    P. 490 (1918); Elkins v. Milliken, 80 Colo. 135, 249 P. 655

    <B>The petition is a preliminary to an initiated

    <ANNO-TEXT>
    <B>Annotator's note.</B>The following annotations include cases
    decided under former provisions similar to this section. 
    <P>
    <B>The provision that a rejected petition for the initiation of
    a measure may be refiled "as an original petition" after
    amendment is to be construed,</B>not that it must be refiled
    within the statutory time fixed for the initial filing of such
    petitions, but after being refiled it is to be considered "as
    an original petition". Brownlow v. Wunch, 103 Colo. 120, 83
    P.2d 775 (1938).</P>
    <P>Former section, which provided that a rejected petition may
    be amended and refiled as an original, did not subject a cured
    petition to the deadline set forth in Colo. Const. art. V, § 11
    (2). Montero v. Meyer, 795 P.2d 242 (Colo. 1990) (decided under
    law in effect prior to 1989 amendment).</P>
    <P>
    <B>But where a petition for the initiation of a constitutional
    amendment is filed within the time fixed</B>by statute, in the
    event of protest and rejection, the sponsors, at their
    election, are entitled to refile the petition when amended
    within the fifteen days allowed by this section. Brownlow v.
    Wunch, 103 Colo. 120, 83 P.2d 775 (1938).</P>
    <P>
    <B>This is true even though the refiling date may fall beyond
    the six-month period</B>fixed by § 1-40-104 for the filing of
    original petitions. Brownlow v. Wunch, 103 Colo. 120, 83 P.2d
    775 (1938).</P>
    <P>
    <B>And there is no statutory authorization for a protest
    against the filing,</B>or refiling after withdrawal, of a
    petition, to initiate a measure under the initiative and
    referendum. Brownlow v. Wunch, 102 Colo. 447, 80 P.2d 444
    (1938).</P>
    <P>
    <B>Moreover, when a petition to initiate a measure under
    initiative and referendum is once withdrawn, it passes from
    official control</B>and may be tampered with, amended, or
    destroyed. Robinson v. Armstrong, 90 Colo. 363, 9 P.2d 481
    (1932); Brownlow v. Wunch, 102 Colo. 447, 80 P.2d 444
    (1938).</P>
    <P>
    <B>If the petition is withdrawn, no review can thereafter be
    prosecuted</B>because without the petition no court could
    adjudicate its sufficiency. Robinson v. Armstrong, 90 Colo.
    363, 9 P.2d 481 (1932).</P>
    <P>
    <B>And an action to review an order of the secretary of state
    declaring a referendum petition insufficient cannot be left
    standing until the petition is amended and refiled,</B>and
    later tried on an issue which did not exist when the cause was
    instituted. Robinson v. Armstrong, 90 Colo. 363, 9 P.2d 481
    (1932).</P>
    <P>
    <B>An action for review cannot survive a withdrawal</B>to be
    further prosecuted on amendment and refiling because if refiled
    it comes back "as an original petition". Robinson v. Armstrong,
    90 Colo. 363, 9 P.2d 481 (1932).</P>
    <P>
    <B>Therefore, the withdrawal of such a petition is equivalent
    to the dismissal of an action to review.</B>Robinson v.
    Armstrong, 90 Colo. 363, 9 P.2d 481 (1932).</P>
    <P>

    S. Ct. 1886, 100 L. Ed. 2d 425 (1988).</P>
    <P>
    <B>Given the business of circulation for hire, there is an
    interest in compelling disclosure by the proponents of the
    persons or entities being hired,</B>not only to prevent fraud
    but to give the public information concerning who the principal
    proponents are and what kind of financial resources may be
    available to them. That legitimate interest, however, is not
    significantly advanced by disclosure of the names and addresses
    of each person paid to circulate any section of the petition.
    What is of interest is the payor, not the payees. Upon
    elimination of the provision requiring identification of the
    circulators, the burden on proponents is slight. This
    requirement as modified is valid. Am. Constitutional Law

    636, 142 L. Ed. 2d 599 (1999).</P>
    <P>
    <B>Since the state has failed to demonstrate how monthly
    reports meet the stated objectives of preventing fraud as
    compared with the final report to be filed</B>when the
    petitions are submitted to the designated election official,
    the monthly reports are restrictions on core political speech
    and are invalid. Preparation of the monthly reports is
    burdensome and involves an additional expense to those
    supporting an initiative or referendum petition. Testimony was
    presented showing that the monthly reports affect the
    circulation process and therefore the amount of core political
    speech. Am. Constitutional Law Found., Inc. v. Meyer, 870 F.
    Supp. 995 (D. Colo. 1994), aff'd, 120 F.3d 1092 (10th Cir.

    142 L. Ed. 2d 599 (1999).</P>
    <P>
    <B>Compelling the disclosure of the identities of every paid
    circulator chills paid circulation, a constitutionally
    protected exercise.</B>Although the fact that disclosure is
    made at the time the proponents file the petition lessens the
    burden of the disclosure, the law fails exacting scrutiny
    because the interests asserted by the state either already are
    or can be protected by less intrusive measures. Am.
    Constitutional Law Found., Inc. v. Meyer, 120 F.3d 1092 (10th
    Cir. 1997), aff'd on other grounds, 525 U.S. 182, 119 S. Ct.
    636, 142 L. Ed. 2d 599 (1999).</P>
    <P>
    <B>Disclosure requirement does not violate the first
    amendment.</B>The state's interest in informing the public
    about the sources of funding for ballot measures outweighs the
    slight burden imposed by the reporting requirement.
    Independence Inst. v. Gessler, 869 F. Supp. 2d 1289 (D. Colo.
    2012).</P>
    <P>
    <B>The limitation in § 1-40-112 (4) on per-signature
    compensation for petition circulators violates the first
    amendment of the United States constitution.</B>Section
    1-40-112 (4) will deter most itinerant professionals from
    working in the state; eliminate low-volume professional
    circulators; and will significantly increase the costs of a
    signature-gathering campaign. Independence Inst. v. Gessler,
    936 F. Supp. 2d 1256 (D. Colo. 2013).</P>
    <P>The cost increase associated with § 1-40-112 (4) is likely
    to lower the chances of underfunded proponents succeeding in
    the initiative and referendum process. Independence Inst. v.
    Gessler, 936 F. Supp. 2d 1256 (D. Colo. 2013).</P>
    <P>The effect of § 1-40-112 (4) will be the exclusion from the
    initiative process of those who, through experience and
    self-selection, are the most efficient and effective
    circulators. Independence Inst. v. Gessler, 936 F. Supp. 2d
    1256 (D. Colo. 2013).</P>
    <P>To the extent § 1-40-112 (4) prevents proponents from using
    individuals who would most effectively convey their message to
    the public, the statute places a substantial burden on the
    proponents' first amendment rights, even if the statute only
    restricts proponents from using some, but not all, circulators.
    Independence Inst. v. Gessler, 936 F. Supp. 2d 1256 (D. Colo.
    2013).</P>
    <P>Given the availability of other effective and less
    burdensome statutory tools to safeguard the state's interest in
    reducing fraud and the number of invalid petition signatures, §
    1-40-112 (4) poses an undue restriction on first amendment
    rights. Independence Inst. v. Gessler, 936 F. Supp. 2d 1256 (D.
    Colo. 2013).</P>
    <P>
    <B>The secretary of state is permanently enjoined from
    enforcing § 1-40-112 (4)</B>and any ancillary statute that
    enforces § 1-40-112 (4), namely, § 1-40-135 and this section to
    the extent that those sections apply to the restriction on
    per-signature compensation found in § 1-40-112 (4).

    <B>The purpose of the provision that the full text of a

    substantial portion thereof be again printed</B>on the official
    ballot, is contrary to all precedent, could serve no useful

    <P>
    <B>The timely publication of a constitutional amendment in 62
    counties of the state, with only five days' delay in the
    sixty-third county</B>and that without fault of either the
    proponents of the amendment or of the secretary of state, is a
    substantial compliance with the requirement of the statute.

    <B>Subsection (3)(a) regarding petition violation procedures
    does not violate the first amendment.</B>Independence Inst. v.
    Gessler, 869 F. Supp. 2d 1289 (D. Colo. 2012).</P>
    <P>
    <B>The limitation in § 1-40-112 (4) on per-signature
    compensation for petition circulators violates the first
    amendment of the United States constitution.</B>Section
    1-40-112 (4) will deter most itinerant professionals from
    working in the state; eliminate low-volume professional
    circulators; and significantly increase the costs of a
    signature-gathering campaign. Independence Inst. v. Gessler,
    936 F. Supp. 2d 1256 (D. Colo. 2013).</P>
    <P>The cost increase associated with § 1-40-112 (4) is likely
    to lower the chances of underfunded proponents succeeding in
    the initiative and referendum process. Independence Inst. v.
    Gessler, 936 F. Supp. 2d 1256 (D. Colo. 2013).</P>
    <P>The effect of § 1-40-112 (4) will be the exclusion from the
    initiative process of those who, through experience and
    self-selection, are the most efficient and effective
    circulators. Independence Inst. v. Gessler, 936 F. Supp. 2d
    1256 (D. Colo. 2013).</P>
    <P>To the extent § 1-40-112 (4) prevents proponents from using
    individuals who would most effectively convey their message to
    the public, the statute places a substantial burden on the
    proponents' first amendment rights, even if the statute only
    restricts proponents from using some, but not all, circulators.
    Independence Inst. v. Gessler, 936 F. Supp. 2d 1256 (D. Colo.
    2013).</P>
    <P>Given the availability of other effective and less
    burdensome statutory tools to safeguard the state's interest in
    reducing fraud and the number of invalid petition signatures, §
    1-40-112 (4) poses an undue restriction on first amendment
    rights. Independence Inst. v. Gessler, 936 F. Supp. 2d 1256 (D.
    Colo. 2013).</P>
    <P>
    <B>The secretary of state is permanently enjoined from
    enforcing § 1-40-112 (4)</B>and any ancillary statute that
    enforces § 1-40-112 (4), namely, this section and § 1-40-121 to
    the extent that those sections apply to the restriction on
    per-signature compensation found in § 1-40-112 (4).

  <M>Bills enacted in the second regular session of the
  seventy-second general assembly that include an act subject to
  petition clause - legislative declaration.</M></CATCH-LINE>(1)
  <N></N>(a)
  <M>The general assembly finds and declares that:</M>
  <P N="(1)(a)(I)">(I)
  <M>The second regular session of the seventy-second general
  assembly convened on January 8, 2020, and was scheduled to
  adjourn sine die on May 6, 2020, pursuant to section 8 of article
  V of the state constitution and Joint Rule 23 (d) of the joint
  rules of the senate and house of representatives, which deems the
  constitutional maximum for the legislative session of one hundred
  twenty calendar days to be one hundred twenty consecutive
  calendar days;</M></P>
  <P N="(1)(a)(II)">(II)
  <M>Joint Rule 44 (g) of the joint rules of the senate and house
  of representatives states that the "maximum of one hundred twenty
  calendar days . . . shall be counted as one hundred twenty
  separate working calendar days if the Governor has declared a
  state of disaster emergency";</M></P>
  <P N="(1)(a)(III)">(III)
  <M>On March 10, 2020, the governor declared a disaster emergency
  due to the presence of coronavirus disease 2019, known as
  "COVID-19", and the public health crisis necessitated the
  temporary adjournment of the second regular session of the
  seventy-second general assembly;</M></P>
  <P N="(1)(a)(IV)">(IV)
  <M>On March 16, 2020, concerned that any legislation enacted
  after May 6, 2020, could be subject to challenge if Joint Rule 44
  (g) were deemed unconstitutional, the general assembly submitted
  an interrogatory to the Colorado supreme court;</M></P>
  <P N="(1)(a)(V)">(V)
  <M>On April 1, 2020, the Colorado supreme court found in In re:
  Interrogatory on House Joint Resolution 20-1006, 2020 CO 23
  (Colo. 2020), that Joint Rule 44 (g) was constitutional.
  Consequently, once it reconvenes, the second regular session of
  the seventy-second general assembly may continue for the
  fifty-two remaining legislative days.</M></P>
  <P N="(1)(a)(VI)">(VI)
  <M>The governor has extended the declared disaster emergency
  several times, which will now expire thirty days from May 7,
  2020, and it is likely that the governor's declared disaster
  emergency will be further extended; and</M></P>
  <P N="(1)(a)(VII)">(VII)
  <M>The second regular session of the seventy-second general
  assembly remained in temporary adjournment until it reconvened on
  May 26, 2020, which will be counted as the sixty-ninth
  legislative day. It is uncertain when the general assembly will
  adjourn sine die, but it could be as late as July 30, 2020, under
  Joint Rule 44 (g) or later if the body undertakes another
  temporary adjournment.</M></P>
  <P N="(1)(b)">(b)
  <M>The general assembly further finds and declares that:</M></P>
  <P N="(1)(b)(I)">(I)
  <M>If a bill does not include a safety clause, it is subject to
  the people's referendum power under section 1 of article V of the
  state constitution, which provides that a person can file a
  referendum petition up to ninety days after a general assembly's
  adjournment sine die to place an act, or an item, section, or
  part of an act on the ballot at a general election;</M></P>
  <P N="(1)(b)(II)">(II)
  <M>When the seventy-second general assembly commenced its second
  regular session on January 8, 2020, and until it reconvened on
  May 26, 2020, the act subject to petition clause specified that
  if a referendum petition were filed against an act, or an item,
  section, or part of an act, it would be placed on the ballot for
  the November 2020 general election;</M></P>
  <P N="(1)(b)(III)">(III)
  <M>The act subject to petition clause implicates two interlocking
  issues, both of which have constitutional, statutory, and
  practical dimensions;</M></P>
  <P N="(1)(b)(IV)">(IV)
  <M>If a petition is filed within the ninety days allowed by the
  state constitution, the office of the secretary of state must
  validate the petition to determine if it is sufficient. Before
  the election, the office of the secretary of state must also
  certify the content of the ballot and county clerk and recorders
  must print and mail ballots in accordance with deadlines set
  forth in both state and federal law.</M></P>
  <P N="(1)(b)(V)">(V)
  <M>At the same time, the constitution requires legislative
  council staff to distribute the ballot information booklets,
  which includes an analysis of each measure placed on the ballot,
  at least thirty days before the election. This process also
  involves multiple steps.</M></P>
  <P N="(1)(b)(VI)">(VI)
  <M>Because of the delayed adjournment sine die due to COVID-19,
  there will not be sufficient time after the constitutional
  deadline to file petitions to meet the deadline in federal law
  for the distribution of ballots to uniformed and overseas
  citizens or the deadline in the state constitution for the
  distribution of the ballot information booklets for the 2020
  general election on November 3;</M></P>
  <P N="(1)(b)(VII)">(VII)
  <M>Section 1 (4)(a) of article V of the state constitution
  specifies that "elections on measures initiated by or referred to
  the people of the state shall be held at the biennial regular
  general election". While under normal circumstances this is
  understood to mean the general election that follows the session
  of the general assembly that passed the bill, the constitution
  does not specify that the election be held at the next general
  election.</M></P>
  <P N="(1)(b)(VIII)">(VIII)
  <M>Because of the delayed adjournment sine die due to COVID-19,
  and the resulting inability to place bills referred by petition
  on the ballot for the 2020 general election, it is reasonable to
  interpret section 1 (4)(a) of article V of the state constitution
  to mean the November 2022 general election instead of the
  November 2020 general election;</M></P>
  <P N="(1)(b)(IX)">(IX)
  <M>Referencing the November 2022 general election instead of the
  November 2020 general election preserves the right of referendum,
  affords the ability to comply with the other statutory and
  constitutional deadlines for the November 2020 election, and
  avoids the uncertainty that might come with the risk of legal
  challenges if this issue is not addressed;</M></P>
  <P N="(1)(b)(X)">(X)
  <M>Amending the act subject to petition clause in each bill could
  require amending hundreds of pending bills and would require
  changing the act subject to petition clause in over seventy
  enacted bills; and</M></P>
  <P N="(1)(b)(XI)">(XI)
  <M>It is a more efficient solution to enact this section to
  address the issue for all bills enacted in the second regular
  session of the seventy-second general assembly.</M></P>
  <P N="(1)(c)">(c)
  <M>The general assembly further finds and declares that:</M></P>
  <P N="(1)(c)(I)">(I)
  <M>The act subject to petition clause in bills that were pending
  or enacted prior to the temporary adjournment of the second
  regular session of the seventy-second general assembly on March
  14, 2020, make reference to August 5, 2020, as the possible
  effective date of such bills if adjournment sine die was on May
  6, 2020; and</M></P>
  <P N="(1)(c)(II)">(II)
  <M>Because the adjournment sine die of the second regular session
  of the seventy-second general assembly was delayed beyond May 6,
  2020, this section is intended to reiterate that unless a later
  date is otherwise specified in the act, the effective date for
  any act, or an item, section , or part of an act with an act
  subject to petition clause is 12:01 a.m. on the day following the
  expiration of the ninety-day period after adjournment sine die,
  not August 5, 2020.</M></P>
  <P N="(2)">(2)
  <M>Notwithstanding any law to the contrary, for any act, item,
  section, or part of an act that is enacted by bill with an act
  subject to petition clause during the second regular session of
  the seventy-second general assembly:</M></P>
  <P N="(2)(a)">(a)
  <M>The act, item, section, or part of the act takes effect at
  12:01 a.m. on the day following the expiration of the ninety-day
  period after adjournment sine die of the second regular session
  of the seventy-second general assembly, unless a later date is
  otherwise specified in the act; and</M></P>
  <P N="(2)(b)">(b)
  <M>Notwithstanding subsection (2)(a) of this section, if a
  referendum petition is filed pursuant to section 1 (3) of article
  V of the state constitution against such an act, item, section,
  or part of the act within the ninety-day period after adjournment
  sine die of the second regular session of the seventy-second
  general assembly, then the act, item, section, or part of the act
  will not take effect unless approved by the people at the general
  election to be held in November 2022 and, in such case, will take
  effect on the date of the official declaration of the vote
  thereon by the governor.</M></P></SECTION-TEXT>

  hereby finds, determines, and declares that section 20 of article
  X of the state constitution requires that a ballot issue election
  be held on the first Tuesday in November of odd-numbered years;
  that the provisions of section 20 (2) and 20 (3) of said article
  X are unclear as to what issues can be submitted to a vote in the
  odd-year election; that section 20 of article X did not amend
  preexisting provisions of the state constitution on the
  initiative, the referendum, and the submission of constitutional
  amendments by the general assembly, and repeal or amendment of
  such provisions by implication is not presumed; that this
  legislation implements section 20 of article X of the state
  constitution, which article is entitled "Revenue" and concerns
  exclusively government revenue raising and appropriations; that
  section 20 of article X requires public votes on additional
  government taxes, spending, or debt; that the language of section
  20 of article X evinces the public's desire to have more
  opportunity to vote on government tax, spending, and debt
  proposals; that a construction of section 20 of article X that
  limits local government electors' opportunities to vote on tax,
  spending, debt, or other proposals would be inconsistent with the
  ballot title of and the voters' intention in adopting said
  amendment; that state and local election officials need guidance
  as to how to administer the November 1993 election; and that, in
  view of the issues set out in this section, the general assembly
  should exercise its legislative power to resolve the ambiguities
  in section 20 of article X in a manner consistent with its

  <N></N>(a)
  <M>Subsection (4) of section 1 of article V of the state
  constitution provides that initiated and referred measures shall
  take effect from and after the official declaration of the vote
  thereon by the proclamation of the Governor. The measure enacting
  article XXVIII of the state constitution takes effect upon
  proclamation of the vote by the Governor. The Governor's
  proclamation was issued on December 20, 2002. However section 13
  of the measure enacting article XXVIII of the state constitution
  provides that the effective date of article XXVIII is December 6,
  2002.</M></P>

  2002. Section 12 of article XXVIII provides for the repeal of
  this section. For the text of the initiative and the vote count,

  <COMMENT-HEAD>ANNOTATION</COMMENT-HEAD>
  <ANNO-NOTE>
    <ANNO-TEXT>
    <B>Annotator's note.</B>Since § 1-45-103 is similar to §
    1-45-103 as it existed prior to its repeal in 2002, relevant
    cases construing that provision and its predecessors have been
    included in the annotations to this section. 
    <P>
    <B>Phrases unconstitutional.</B>The phrase in subsection (7),
    "which unambiguously refer to any specific public office or
    candidate for such office, but does not include expenditures
    made by persons, other than political parties and political
    committees, in the regular course and scope of their business
    and political messages sent solely to their members[,]" is
    unconstitutional under the first amendment. Citizens for
    Responsible Gov't State Political Action Comm. v. Davidson, 236
    F.3d 1174 (10th Cir. 2000).</P>
    <P>The phrase in subsection (11), "or which unambiguously
    refers to such candidate[,]" is unconstitutional under the
    first amendment. Citizens for Responsible Gov't State Political
    Action Comm. v. Davidson, 236 F.3d 1174 (10th Cir. 2000).</P>
    <P>The court concluded that the unconstitutional phrases were
    severable and declared subsections (7) and (11) invalid only
    insofar as they reach beyond that which may constitutionally be
    regulated. Citizens for Responsible Gov't State Political
    Action Comm. v. Davidson, 236 F.3d 1174 (10th Cir. 2000).</P>
    <P>
    <B>It is apparent from the plain language of subsection (2)
    that a candidate committee may be comprised of one person only
    and that the candidate acting alone may be a candidate
    committee.</B>Thus, a candidate committee who acts alone for
    the purpose of receiving campaign contributions or making
    campaign expenditures is a candidate committee subject to the
    disclosure requirements of this article. Therefore, the
    expenditures made by a candidate from the candidate's personal
    funds before certification of his or her committee were either
    contributions to the ultimately certified candidate committee
    or expenditures by a separate campaign committee composed of
    the candidate alone. Hlavec v. Davidson, 64 P.3d 881 (Colo.
    App. 2002) (decided under section that was repealed by article
    XXVIII of the state constitution).</P>
    <P>
    <B>Court's interpretation of the term "candidate committee" to
    include expenditures of personal money by the candidate on his
    or her campaign does not limit the amount of money a candidate
    could personally spend on his or her campaign in violation of
    the first amendment.</B>The act does not specifically address
    whether a candidate's personal expenditures are contributions.
    However, in light of Buckley v. Valeo, 424 U.S. 1 (1976), the
    definition of "contribution" contained in subsection (4) does
    not include a candidate's expenditures of personal funds and
    contributions made by the candidate to his or her own candidate
    committee. Accordingly, the court rejected candidate's first
    amendment argument. Hlavec v. Davidson, 64 P.3d 881 (Colo. App.
    2002) (decided under section that was repealed by article
    XXVIII of the state constitution).</P>
    <P>
    <B>A contribution under § 2(5)(a)(IV) of article XXVIII of the
    state constitution and as incorporated by reference into
    subsection (6)(a) of this section requires</B>that: (1) a thing
    of value (2) be given to a candidate, either directly or
    indirectly, (3) in order to promote the candidate's nomination,
    retention, recall, or election. Keim v. Douglas County Sch.
    Dist., 2017 CO 81, 397 P.3d 377.</P>
    <P>
    <B>Term "independent expenditure" in subsection (7) permits the
    regulation of only those expenditures that are used for
    communications that expressly advocate the election or defeat
    of a clearly identified candidate.</B>This standard includes
    the words and phrases listed in Buckley v. Valeo, 424 U.S. 1
    (1976), and other substantially similar or synonymous words.
    This approach remains focused on actual words, as contrasted
    with images, symbols, or other contextual factors, provides
    adequate notice in light of due process concerns, and strikes
    an appropriate balance between trying to preserve the goals of
    campaign finance reform and protecting political speech. League
    of Women Voters v. Davidson, 23 P.3d 1266 (Colo. App.
    2001).</P>
    <P>None of the advertisements of so-called educational
    committee at issue amounted to "express advocacy" as that term
    is applied in Buckley and progeny and, therefore, so-called
    educational committee was not subject to the requirements of
    the Fair Campaign Practices Act. League of Women Voters v.
    Davidson, 23 P.3d 1266 (Colo. App. 2001).</P>
    <P>
    <B>The term "issue" in subsection (8) includes</B>an initiative
    that has gone through the title-setting process, but has not
    been formally certified for the election ballot. To construe
    the term to include only measures actually placed on the ballot
    would frustrate the purposes of the Campaign Reform Act by
    allowing groups to raise and spend money, without limit and
    without disclosure to the public, to convince electors to sign
    or not to sign a particular petition, thus significantly
    influencing its success or failure. Colo. for Family Values v.
    Meyer, 936 P.2d 631 (Colo. App. 1997).</P>
    <P>
    <B>Telephone opinion poll was not "electioneering" and thus did
    not constitute an "electioneering communication" within the
    meaning of subsection (9) of this section and § 6 of article
    XXVIII of the state constitution.</B>In giving effect to the
    intent of the electorate, court gives term "communication" its
    plain and ordinary meaning. Court relies upon dictionary
    definitions of "communication" that contemplate imparting a
    message to, rather than having mere contact with, another
    party. In reviewing scripts used by telephone opinion pollster,
    "communication" occurred because "facts, information, thoughts,
    or opinions" were "imparted, transmitted, interchanged,
    expressed, or exchanged" by pollster to those it called.
    Telephone opinion pollster, therefore, communicated information
    to members of the electorate during its opinion poll. Harwood
    v. Senate Majority Fund, LLC, 141 P.3d 962 (Colo. App.
    2006).</P>
    <P>Telephone opinion poll, however, did not satisfy meaning of
    electioneering. Colorado electorate intended article XXVIII to
    regulate communication that expresses "electorate advocacy" and
    tends to "influence the outcome of Colorado elections". This
    conclusion is reinforced by plain and ordinary meaning of term
    "electioneering". Court relies upon dictionary definitions
    suggesting that "electioneering" is defined by such activities
    as taking an active part in an election campaign, campaigning
    for one's own election, or trying to sway public opinion
    especially by the use of propaganda and that "campaigning"
    means influencing the public to support a particular candidate,
    ticket, or measure. Here, telephone opinion poll did not seek
    to influence voters or sway public opinion but instead merely
    asked neutral questions to collect data and measure public
    opinion. Accordingly, telephone opinion poll did not constitute
    an "electioneering communication" under subsection (9) of this
    section and article XXVIII of the state constitution. Harwood
    v. Senate Majority Fund, LLC, 141 P.3d 962 (Colo. App.
    2006).</P>
    <P>
    <B>The term "issue committee" covers only those issue
    committees that were formed for the purpose of supporting or
    opposing a ballot initiative.</B>An association that was formed
    and operated for purposes other than "accepting contributions
    or making expenditures to support or oppose any ballot issue or
    ballot question" does not become an "issue committee" as
    defined in this section if, at a future point in time, it
    engages in those activities with regard to a specific ballot
    issue or ballot question. Common Sense Alliance v. Davidson,
    995 P.2d 748 (Colo. 2000).</P>
    <P>
    <B>A "political committee" is formed when two or more persons
    associate themselves with the original purpose of making
    independent expenditures.</B>Citizens for Responsible Gov't
    State Political Action Comm. v. Davidson, 236 F.3d 1174 (10th
    Cir. 2000).</P>
    <P>
    <B>The term "political committee" in subsection (10)
    includes</B>a for-profit corporation which makes contributions,
    contributions in kind, or expenditures to or on behalf of state
    political campaigns out of its ordinary corporate treasury.
    Therefore, such corporation is required to file a statement of
    organization, to report its contributions, contributions in
    kind, and expenditures, and otherwise to comply with any filing
    and reporting requirements of the Campaign Reform Act of 1974.
    Colo. Common Cause v. Meyer, 758 P.2d 153 (Colo. 1988) (decided
    prior to 1988 amendment to subsection (10)).</P>
    <P>
    <B>While the stated purposes for the formation of an
    organization may be one criterion upon which to determine
    whether it is a "political committee", such purposes are not
    conclusive.</B>To so hold would permit regulable conduct to
    escape regulation merely because the stated purposes were
    misleading, ambiguous, fraudulent, or all three. In addition,
    such a holding would exalt form over substance and would almost
    entirely eviscerate the Fair Campaign Practices Act and make a
    mockery of legitimate attempts at campaign finance reform.
    League of Women Voters v. Davidson, 23 P.3d 1266 (Colo. App.
    2001).</P>
    <P>
    <B>The use of the disjunctive term "or" in subsection (11)
    renders the definition of "political message" applicable to
    messages that "unambiguously refer to a candidate", even if
    such messages do not also "advocate the election or defeat" of
    that candidate.</B>Citizens for Responsible Gov't State
    Political Action Comm. v. Davidson, 236 F.3d 1174 (10th Cir.
    2000).</P>
    <P>
    <B>To qualify as a political message under subsection (11), a
    message need only:</B>(1) Be delivered by telephone, any print
    or electronic media, or other written material, and (2) either
    (a) advocate the election or defeat of any candidate or (b)
    unambiguously refer to such candidate. Citizens for Responsible
    Gov't State Political Action Comm. v. Davidson, 236 F.3d 1174
    (10th Cir. 2000).</P>
    <P>
    <B>Voter guides that unambiguously refer to specific candidates
    but do not expressly advocate the election or defeat of any
    candidate constitute "political messages" as defined in
    subsection (11).</B>Therefore, the funds expended to produce
    and disseminate the voter guides are subject to regulation as
    "independent expenditures" as the term is defined in subsection
    (7). Citizens for Responsible Gov't State Political Action
    Comm. v. Davidson, 236 F.3d 1174 (10th Cir. 2000).</P>
    <P>
    <B>"Expressly advocating" for purposes of the definition of
    expenditure in subsection (10) is limited to speech that
    explicitly exhorts the viewer or reader to vote for or against
    a candidate in an upcoming election using either the "magic
    words" described in Buckly v. Valeo, 424 U.S. 1, 44 n.52
    (1976), or substantially similar words.</B>The court declined
    to adopt a functional equivalence test for "express advocacy"
    that would be difficult to apply and unconstitutionally chill
    political speech. None of the 17 ads at issue contained any of
    the magic words or substantially similar synonyms. Accordingly,
    because none of the ads constituted "expenditures", neither of
    the two political organizations that distributed the ads were
    subject to regulation as "political committees". Colo. Ethics
    v. Senate Majority Fund, LLC, 2012 CO 12, 269 P.3d 1248.</P>
    <P>
    <B>Administrative law judge (ALJ) did not err in concluding
    that definition of "expenditures" did not apply to metropolitan
    district boards.</B>Respondents had argued that the
    metropolitan districts qualified as "persons" that could expend
    payments on behalf of issue committee supporting ballot issue.
    Even if the definition of "person" could be stretched to cover
    political subdivisions of the state such as metropolitan
    districts, respondents failed to explain how the payments at
    issue were "made with the prior knowledge and consent of an
    agent" of the issue committee that was not yet formed in order
    to bring such payments within the definition of "expenditure".
    Skruch v. Highlands Ranch Metro. Dists., 107 P.3d 1140 (Colo.
    App. 2004).</P>
    <P>
    <B>ALJ did not err by interpreting "expenditure" to occur when
    a payment is made and when there is a contractual agreement and
    the amount is determined.</B>The use of the disjunctive "or" in
    the definition of "expenditure" indicates that an expenditure
    is made if either criterion is met after the ballot title is
    submitted. Skruch v. Highlands Ranch Metro. Dists., 107 P.3d
    1140 (Colo. App. 2004).</P>
    <P>
    <B>ALJ erred by failing to determine whether major purpose
    of</B>nonprofit association engaging in political advocacy was
    the nomination or election of candidates. Alliance for
    Colorado's Families v. Gilbert, 172 P.3d 964 (Colo. App.
    2007).</P>
    <P>
    <B>ALJ correctly construed the phrase "for the purpose
    of"</B>in § 2(5)(a)(IV) of article XXVIII of the state
    constitution in accordance with its plain meaning to indicate
    "an anticipated result that is intended or desired" and not
    "with the effect of". Such a construction would improperly
    conflate the distinct concepts of purpose and effect. Such an
    interpretation would also lead to unintended consequences far
    beyond the scope of issues presented in the case. CEW v. City
    &amp; County of Broomfield, 203 P.3d 623 (Colo. App. 2009).</P>
    <P>
    <B>Since effect of city employees' actions, rather than their
    intent, is to be examined, court further rejects argument that
    intent is to be gauged by objective rather than subjective
    criteria.</B>Inquiry into purpose requires examination of the
    intent of the person alleged to have made a campaign
    contribution. ALJ considered evidence concerning the city
    employees' intent and determined, on the basis of substantial
    evidence in the record, that organization bringing campaign
    finance complaint had not met its burden of proving that the
    employees provided services for the purpose of promoting a
    campaign even though employees knew information would be
    helpful to the candidates to whom the information was provided.
    Organization's interpretation improperly equates knowledge of
    the possible effects of one's actions with an intent to achieve
    a particular result. Accordingly, ALJ correctly determined that
    city's contribution of staff time was not "for the purpose of"
    promoting a political campaign. CEW v. City &amp; County of
    Broomfield, 203 P.3d 623 (Colo. App. 2009).</P>
    <P>
    <B>Political committee's spending on legal expenses did not
    qualify as an "expenditure".</B>The meaning of expenditure
    under § 2(8)(a) of article XXVIII of the state constitution and
    subsection (10) of this section is limited to spending for
    "expressly advocating" the election or defeat of a candidate,
    and express advocacy is limited further still to advocacy by
    use of "magic words" or substantially similar synonyms. Money
    spent for legal expenses is not spent for expressly advocating
    the election or defeat of a candidate and therefore is not an
    expenditure. Camp. Integ. Watchdog v. Alliance for Safe, 2018
    CO 7, 409 P.3d 357.</P>
    <P>
    <B>Payment by unions of staff salaries for time spent
    organizing walks to distribute political literature and
    payments of other costs associated with related political
    activities did not constitute prohibited expenditures in
    violation of § 3(4)(a) of article XXVIII of the state
    constitution.</B>Whether payments made by the union are
    prohibited as "expenditures" depends upon whether they are
    exempt from regulation by the membership communication
    exception in § 2(8)(b)(III) of article XXVIII of the state
    constitution as payments for "any communication solely to
    members and their families". The membership communication
    exception must be construed broadly to reflect the plain
    language of this constitutional provision and to satisfy the
    demands of the first amendment. The membership communication
    exception as construed applies to most of the union's
    activities in this case. To the extent that the challenged
    union activities are not embraced by the membership
    communication exception, the administrative law judge correctly
    held that person filing campaign finance complaint failed to
    prove facts demonstrating that an expenditure was made. Colo.
    Educ. Ass'n v. Rutt, 184 P.3d 65 (Colo. 2008).</P>
    <P>
    <B>The membership communication exception found in §
    2(8)(b)(III) of article XXVIII of the state constitution must
    be extended to and embraced within the definition of
    "contribution".</B>To hold otherwise nullifies the exception.
    The same conduct may not be protected by the membership
    communication exception to expenditures, that is, treated as an
    exempt expenditure, yet, at the same time, be prohibited as a
    nonexempt contribution. Such a result would be contrary to the
    intent of the electorate and constitute an unreasonable and
    disharmonious application of this article. Colo. Educ. Ass'n v.
    Rutt, 184 P.3d 65 (Colo. 2008).</P>
    <P>
    <B>Unions' challenged conduct does not meet the pertinent
    definitions of a contribution under § 2(5)(a)(II) and
    (5)(a)(IV) of article XXVIII of the state constitution and
    subsection (6) of this section.</B>Facts may reasonably be
    viewed in two contradictory ways: One advancing the union's
    argument that the payment of union staff salaries for
    organizing political events were paid for the benefit of the
    unions and their members and thus exempt from regulation; the
    other that the payments constituted payments made to a third
    party for the benefit of the candidate or anything of value
    given indirectly to the candidate and, thus, were prohibited
    contributions. When the first amendment is at stake, the tie
    goes to the speaker rather than to censorship and regulation.
    On the facts of this case, the unions did not make any
    prohibited contributions in violation of § 3(4)(a) of article
    XXVIII of the state constitution. Colo. Educ. Ass'n v. Rutt,
    184 P.3d 65 (Colo. 2008).</P>
    <P>
    <B>School district did not make a prohibited contribution to a
    campaign under § 2(5)(a)(IV) of article XXVIII and § 1-45-117
    (1)(a)(I).</B>A research report from a national think tank
    supportive of a school district's educational reform efforts
    that the district commissioned and paid for with public funds
    constitutes a "thing of value" for purposes of the definition

    firm that defended the political committee and the court of
    appeals were both third parties in relation to the political
    committee, the payment of filing fees to the court and of legal
    fees to the law firm were "payment[s] made to a third party."
    And the payments were "for the benefit" of the political
    committee because they furthered the committee's legal defense.
    Because the payments of the political committee's legal
    expenses were contributions to the committee under §

    accepted contributions and made expenditures of over $200 to
    oppose the retention of three justices of the Colorado supreme

    cannot be both a political committee and issue committee

    "ballot question" because it does not involve a citizen
    petition or referred measure. Because a judicial retention vote
    does not meet the definition of a "ballot issue" or "ballot

    <B>Secretary of state's proposed rule,</B>8 Colo. Code Regs.
    1505-6, § 1.12, intended to fill a gap in subsection (12)(b) of
    this section by defining "major purpose" in the definition of
    issue committee, is arbitrary and capricious. The rule imposed
    a requirement that, in order to determine whether an issue
    committee has a "major purpose" under the constitutional and
    statutory definitions, a demonstrated pattern of conduct is
    established where the organization's annual expenditures in
    support of or in opposition to ballot issues or ballot
    questions exceed 30% of the organization's total spending
    during the same period. The rule is arbitrary and capricious
    because the 30% threshold is unsupported by competent evidence
    in the record. Even if there was competent evidence in the
    record to support a 30% threshold, this threshold would not
    resolve the ambiguity as to how a "pattern of conduct" must be
    demonstrated. Thus, the rule's 30% threshold is manifestly
    contrary to subsection (12)(b)'s use of the phrase "pattern of
    conduct" in its definition of major purpose. Colo. Ethics Watch
    v. Gessler, 2013 COA 172M, 363 P.3d 727.</P>
    <P>Secretary of state's proposed rule, 8 Colo. Code Regs.
    1505-6, § 1.18.2, designed to fill a gap in the constitutional
    definition of "political committee" in subsection (14) of this
    section by explaining precisely how the judicially created
    "major purpose" test limits what groups qualify as political
    committees, is invalid because the constitutional definition is
    clear and unambiguous: Political committees are defined by
    their contributions or expenditures, not by an additional major
    purpose test. Because the provisions are clear, there is no gap
    for the secretary to fill, and he does not have the authority
    to add a "major purpose" requirement, even in an attempt to
    codify judicial precedent. Colo. Ethics Watch v. Gessler, 2013
    COA 172M, 363 P.3d 727.</P>
    <P>District court correctly invalidated secretary of state's
    proposed rules, 8 Colo. Code Regs. 1505-6, §§ 7.2 and 1.10,
    designed to fill a gap in subsection (14.5) of this section by
    narrowing the definition of the phrase "political organization"
    to conform to federal judicial precedent. The secretary's
    addition in § 7.2 of the rules of a requirement that a section
    527 entity must have a major purpose of influencing state
    elections contradicts the clear and unambiguous language of
    subsection (14.5) of this section. This section does not look
    to the purpose of the entity but to the actual activities of
    the entity. The secretary's addition in § 1.10 of the rules of
    an "express advocacy" requirement also contradicts the clear
    and unambiguous language of this section. These rules thus
    contradict the clear and unambiguous language of this section
    by improperly eliminating the statutory distinction between a
    political organization and a political committee. Colo. Ethics

    <B>Subsection (6)(b), which concerns all contributions "for
    which the contributor receives compensation or consideration",
    applies to payments made to a state political party</B>for
    vendor tables at the party's state convention. Interpreting
    subsection (6)(b) as applying only to payments made to
    candidate committees that have determined the value of the
    goods and services provided while excluding payments made to
    political parties would lead to an absurd result. It is
    illogical that the general assembly intended "contribution" to
    enable only candidate committees to determine the value of

    <B>Under the plain language of subsection (6)(b), political
    parties are required to report only that portion of payments

    rendered.</B>While the state constitution broadly defines a
    "contribution", the plain language of the statute addresses the
    determination of the contribution amount when the contributor
    receives something of value in the transaction. When a
    contributor pays a political party for a good or service, and
    the amount paid is greater than its value, only the amount paid
    in excess of the value is considered a contribution. The
    general assembly intended to differentiate between those
    payments for services that equal the value of those goods and
    services, which are not contributions, and those made in
    excess, which are. Campaign Integrity v. Republican Comm., 2017

    did not properly report. The amount of a contribution includes
    only payments made in excess of the value received by the

    <B>The classification in former subsections (3) and (4) (now
    subsections (3), (4), and (4.5)) violates the right to equal
    protection for individuals wishing to contribute to write-ins,
    unaffiliated candidates, and minor-party candidates when each
    candidate runs unopposed for the nomination.</B>This statute
    does not set contribution limits based on who has a primary and
    who does not. It creates different contribution limits for
    individuals running against one another. It allows Republican
    and Democratic candidates to collect and spend $400 after the
    primary. Thus, a Republican or Democratic candidate can obtain
    $400 from a single contributor and spend all of the money in
    the general election. For the same general election, a write-in
    candidate can obtain only $200 from a single contributor.

    <B>Under § 9(2)(a) of article XXVIII of the state constitution,
    a complaint alleging that a contribution exceeds the applicable
    limit, either on its own or when aggregated with previous

    contribution.</B>Lambert v. Ritter Inaugural Comm., Inc., 218
    P.3d 1115 (Colo. App. 2009).</P>
    <P>To give effect to both the contribution limit in § 3 of
    article XXVIII and the time limit in § 9(2)(a) of article
    XXVIII, a complaint may seek relief only as to contributions
    that, standing alone or aggregated, exceed the limit and are
    made within the preceding 180-day period, and the relief
    available under § 10(1) of article XXVIII or subsection (7)(b)
    of this section is limited to those excess contributions as to
    which the complaint is timely. Lambert v. Ritter Inaugural

    <B>Subsection (2) is constitutional.</B>The state's interest in
    preventing avoidance of valid contribution limits by use of
    funds carried over from prior campaigns is both compelling and
    served by the restriction set forth in subsection (2). This
    provision is narrowly tailored to accomplish the state's
    legitimate interest. Citizens for Responsible Gov't State
    Political Action Comm. v. Buckley, 60 F. Supp. 2d 1066 (D.
    Colo. 1999). 
    <P>
    <B>Candidate's disclosure report not required to report
    unexpended campaign funds at the end of an election cycle as
    contributions from a political party.</B>To accomplish the
    purpose of subsection (5), it is necessary only that a
    candidate committee report the amount of unexpended campaign
    funds on hand at the end of an election cycle. To report money
    already on hand as a fictional, new contribution from an
    unidentified political party would artificially inflate the
    amount of funds reportedly available to a candidate committee
    and would be confusing to those who read the report. Williams

    <B>Candidate committee permitted to use unexpended
    contributions to pay elected state senator's legal
    fees.</B>Although legal fees are not specifically mentioned as
    permissible expenses under subsection (1)(b)(V), the words
    "including, but not limited to," indicate that the statute
    merely illustrates the kinds of expenses that may be regarded
    as directly related to an elected official's duties. Here, the
    legal fees may properly be characterized as directly related to
    official duties of elected state senator. The senator's duties
    include filing periodic reports with the secretary of state,
    and the fees were reasonably necessary to demonstrate that
    senator and his or her committee had properly performed this
    duty. Williams v. Teck, 113 P.3d 1255 (Colo. App.

    <B>Act is neither unconstitutionally vague nor

    argument, court finds that act provides sufficient notice to
    persons of ordinary intelligence that expenditures, regardless
    of the source of the funds, must be reported. As to candidate's
    arguments that act is unconstitutionally overbroad and inhibits
    basic first amendment freedoms, court finds that, construed to
    preserve its constitutionality, the act does not inhibit a
    candidate's expenditures of personal funds so long as those
    expenditures are made through a candidate committee and
    reported in accordance with this section. Hlavec v. Davidson,

    committee.</B>There is virtually no proper governmental
    interest in imposing disclosure requirements on
    ballot-initiative committees that raise and expend minimal
    money, and limited interest cannot justify the burden that
    disclosure requirements impose on such a committee. Sampson v.
    Buescher, 625 F.3d 1247 (10th Cir. 2010); Coal. for Secular
    Gov't v. Williams, 815 F.3d 1267 (10th Cir. 2016).</P>
    <P>The financial burden of state regulation on ballot
    initiative committee member's freedom of association approaches
    or exceeds the value of their financial contributions to their
    political effort; and the governmental interest in imposing
    those regulations is minimal, if not nonexistent, in light of
    the small size of the contributions. Therefore it is
    unconstitutional to impose that burden on the committee
    members. Sampson v. Buescher, 625 F.3d 1247 (10th Cir. 2010);
    Coal. for Secular Gov't v. Williams, 815 F.3d 1267 (10th Cir.
    2016).</P>
    <P>
    <B>The reporting requirements of subsection (1)(a)(I) are not
    unconstitutional as applied to a political committee.</B>The
    United States supreme court has consistently upheld disclosure
    and reporting requirements for political committees that exist
    primarily to influence elections. It makes no difference that
    the contributions were not used to directly influence an
    election -- any contribution to a political committee that has
    the major purpose of influencing an election is deemed to be
    campaign related and thus justifies the burden of disclosure
    and reporting. Camp. Integ. Watchdog v. Alliance for Safe, 2018
    CO 7, 409 P.3d 357.</P>
    <P>
    <B>The $200 contribution and expenditure threshold for issue
    committees under § 2(10)(a)(II) of article XXVIII and the
    retrospective reporting requirements for issue committees under
    subsection (1)(a)(I) of this section were not facially
    invalidated by the tenth circuit's holding in Sampson v.
    Buescher, 625 F.3d 1247 (10th Cir. 2010).</B>The secretary of
    state promulgated 8 Colo. Code Regs. 1505-6, § 4.1 (rule 4.1),
    in response to Sampson. Because rule 4.1's $5,000 threshold and
    its retrospective reporting exemption clearly conflict with the
    still-valid constitutional and statutory provisions, rule 4.1
    is unlawful and set aside. The secretary of state exceeded his
    authority in promulgating the rule. Gessler v. CO Common Cause
    &amp; Ethics Watch, 2014 CO 44, 327 P.3d 232.</P>
    <P>Although in promulgating rule 4.27 (later codified as rule
    4.1), the secretary was attempting to clarify the registration
    and reporting requirements in light of Sampson, Sampson did not
    facially invalidate any provision of the campaign finance law,
    and, to the extent Sampson impacts the future application of
    campaign finance laws on issue committees in a similar factual
    context, rule 4.27 exceeds the scope of Sampson. Colo. Common
    Cause v. Gessler, 2012 COA 147, 410 P.3d 451, aff'd, 2014 CO
    44, 327 P.3d 232.</P>
    <P>
    <B>Under subsection (1)(a), candidate committees must disclose
    all expenditures and obligations, even if no contributions are
    received.</B>Thus, if a candidate runs without a separate
    committee and finances the campaign from personal funds, the
    candidate is a candidate committee and must disclose
    expenditures and obligations as required by subsection (1)(a).
    Nothing in subsection (1)(a) indicates that expenditures must
    be reported only if drawn on outside contributions. Hlavec v.
    Davidson, 64 P.3d 881 (Colo. App. 2002).</P>
    <P>Here, both candidate and the candidate committee made
    expenditures under the authority of the candidate. Thus, both
    the candidate and the committee were candidate committees or
    the candidate was acting through the formed committee. In
    either instance, the expenditures were subject to the
    disclosure requirements of subsection (1)(a). Hlavec v.
    Davidson, 64 P.3d 881 (Colo. App. 2002).</P>
    <P>
    <B>"Obligations entered into" as used in subsection (1)(a)(I)
    includes only obligations entered into for making expenditures
    and does not cover activities by a committee that incur
    debt.</B>It would be absurd to require reporting of all
    obligations to spend money regardless of purpose yet require
    reporting of money actually spent only for a single narrow
    purpose, express advocacy. Moreover, the Fair Campaign
    Practices Act ties the meaning of obligation to expenditures
    when it expressly defines "obligating" to mean an agreement to
    make, or indirect provision of, an independent expenditure. The
    definition of "obligating" in § 1-45-103 (12.7) indicates that
    the legislature intended to treat obligations no more broadly
    than it did actual spending. Camp. Integ. Watchdog v. Alliance
    for Safe, 2018 CO 7, 409 P.3d 357.</P>
    <P>
    <B>Candidate's disclosure report not required to report
    unexpended campaign funds at the end of an election cycle as
    contributions from a political party.</B>It is necessary only
    that a candidate committee report the amount of unexpended
    campaign funds on hand at the end of an election cycle. To
    report money already on hand as a fictional, new contribution
    from an unidentified political party would artificially inflate
    the amount of funds reportedly available to a candidate
    committee and would be confusing to those who read the report.
    Williams v. Teck, 113 P.3d 1255 (Colo. App. 2005).</P>
    <P>
    <B>Payments to a law firm to defend political committee in a
    tort suit are a reportable contribution under § 2(5)(a)(II) of
    article XXVIII of the state constitution.</B>Because the law
    firm that defended the political committee and the court of
    appeals were both third parties in relation to the political
    committee, the payment of filing fees to the court and of legal
    fees to the law firm were "payment[s] made to a third party".
    And the payments were "for the benefit" of the political
    committee because they furthered the committee's legal defense.
    Because the payments of the political committee's legal
    expenses were "contributions" to the committee under section
    2(5)(a)(II), the committee was required to report them as
    contributions under subsection (1)(a)(I) of this section. Camp.

    <B>Order by administrative law judge (ALJ) assessing penalty
    against nonprofit association engaging in political advocacy
    based upon determination by ALJ that association was a
    political committee is vacated and case remanded.</B>Under
    controlling precedent, regulation under campaign finance laws
    should be tied to groups controlled by candidates or which have
    a "major purpose" of electing candidates. Here, record does not
    permit a determination of whether major purpose test satisfied
    as to association. On remand, ALJ instructed to determine
    whether association's "major purpose" in 2004 was the
    nomination or election of candidates. Alliance for Colorado's
    Families v. Gilbert, 172 P.3d 964 (Colo. App. 2007).</P>

    <B>ALJ had authority to impose appropriate sanction under §
    9(2)(a) of article XXVIII of the state constitution for

    of article XXVIII or initiate a complaint under § 9(2)(a).
    Patterson Recall Comm., Inc. v. Patterson, 209 P.3d 1210 (Colo.
    App. 2009).</P>
    <P>
    <B>Nowhere in this article or in rules promulgated by secretary
    of state is the filing requirement conditioned upon posting by
    or receiving electronic transmissions from the county clerk and
    recorder.</B>Instead, the requirement to disclose and file
    reports is unconditionally imposed until a committee is
    terminated. Patterson Recall Comm., Inc. v. Patterson, 209 P.3d
    1210 (Colo. App. 2009).</P>
    <P>
    <B>Section 9(2)(a) of article XXVIII of the state constitution
    authorizes ALJ to render a decision upon a complaint and, if
    ALJ concludes that a violation has occurred, "such decision
    shall include any appropriate order, sanction, or relief
    authorized by this article".</B>Nothing in the article,
    however, recognizes or grants a defense of "good faith", and an
    ALJ is not at liberty to engraft any limitation or restriction
    not specifically provided. Patterson Recall Comm., Inc. v.
    Patterson, 209 P.3d 1210 (Colo. App. 2009).</P>
    <P>
    <B>While § 9(2)(a) of article XXVIII of the state constitution
    requires ALJ to include in the decision an appropriate order,
    sanction, or relief as authorized by the terms of this
    article,</B>ALJ has discretion to impose no section at all if
    he or she reasonably concludes one would not be appropriate.

    <B>Adoption of 8 Colo. Code Regs, 1505-6, § 9.3 of the Colorado
    secretary of state's rules concerning campaign and political
    finance requiring the name of the candidate unambiguously
    referred to in the electioneering communication to be included
    in the electioneering report was within the rulemaking
    authority of the secretary of state under § 9(1)(b) of article
    XXVIII of the state constitution and §§ 1-1-107 (2)(a) and
    1-45-111.5 (1).</B>Colo. Citizens for Ethics in Gov't v. Comm.
    for the Am. Dream, 187 P.3d 1207 (Colo. App. 2008).</P>
    <P>
    <B>District court properly invalidated secretary of state's
    proposed rule, 8 Colo. Code Regs. 1505-6, § 18.1.8, that
    attempted to fill a gap in subsection (2.5) of this section by
    creating a uniform way to assess "good cause" and levy
    fines.</B>The rule merely eliminates penalties after a
    contribution is first disclosed and after election day
    regardless of a showing of good cause. The rule applies equally
    to those who intentionally avoid reporting obligations as well
    as those who do not report due to inadvertence. So, because the
    rule does not fill a gap, but applies irrespective of whether
    there is actually good cause to reduce or eliminate penalties,
    the rule is manifestly contrary to § 10(2)(c) of art. XXVIII of
    the state constitution, which requires the secretary to set
    aside or reduce a penalty only upon a showing of good cause.

    <B>Administrative law judge (ALJ)</B>correctly dismissed
    appellants' agency appeal under § 10 (2)(b)(I) of article
    XXVIII of the state constitution for lack of subject matter
    jurisdiction. No question that appellants were required to file
    reports with secretary of state under subsection (1) of this
    section once appellant-candidate became a candidate for the
    general assembly. This does not mean, however, appellants
    acquired right to appeal penalty to secretary of state. Report
    at issue was filed not in connection with appellant-candidate's
    candidacy for the general assembly but solely in connection
    with position as a county commissioner. Thus, ALJ correctly
    determined that, for purposes of report and penalty at issue,
    appellants were persons required to file appeal with county
    clerk and recorder, not with secretary of state. Sullivan v.
    Bucknam, 140 P.3d 330 (Colo. App. 2006). 
    <P>Although appellants could have been required to file a
    report with the secretary of state in certain circumstances,
    those circumstances were not present in instant case.
    Appellants do not qualify as persons required to file with
    secretary of state under § 10 (2)(b)(I) of article XXVIII of
    the state constitution for purposes of underlying action merely
    because they could have been required to so file in other
    circumstances. Sullivan v. Bucknam, 140 P.3d 330 (Colo. App.
    2006).</P>
    <P>
    <B>Nowhere in this article or in rules promulgated by secretary
    of state is the filing requirement conditioned upon posting by
    or receiving electronic transmissions from the county clerk and
    recorder.</B>Instead, the requirement to disclose and file
    reports is unconditionally imposed until a committee is
    terminated. Patterson Recall Comm., Inc. v. Patterson, 209 P.3d
    1210 (Colo. App. 2009).</P>
    <P>
    <B>ALJ had jurisdiction to impose penalty for violation of Rule
    9.3 and did not err by imposing a $1,000 penalty on political
    committee.</B>Section (2)(a) of article XXVIII of the state
    constitution grants an ALJ authority to conduct hearings on
    alleged violations of the article and the "Fair Campaign
    Practices Act" and to impose penalties if a violation has
    occurred. Rule 9.3 is necessary to implement former § 1-45-109
    (5), and, under subsection (2)(a) of this section, sanctions
    can be imposed for violations of this section. Colo. Citizens
    for Ethics in Gov't v. Comm. for the Am. Dream, 187 P.3d 1207
    (Colo. App. 2008).</P>
    <P>
    <B>An organization that supports or opposes the retention of a
    judicial officer is a political committee because it supports
    or opposes the election of a candidate and because it is
    recognized as such by subsection (1)(a)(I).</B>Organization
    accepted contributions and made expenditures of over $200 to
    oppose the retention of three justices of the Colorado supreme
    court. It is, therefore, a political committee. Organization
    cannot be both a political committee and issue committee
    because the two are defined under subsections (10) and (12) of
    art. XXVIII of the state constitution to be mutually exclusive.

    <B>Subsection (1.5)(a) of this section and § 9(2)(a) of article
    XXVIII are facially unconstitutional under the first and
    fourteenth amendments to the federal constitution.</B>These
    enforcement provisions regulate core political speech and are
    content-based; therefore, they are subject to strict scrutiny.
    The provisions are not narrowly tailored to advance the state's
    interest in enforcing its campaign finance laws. Holland v.
    Williams, 457 F. Supp. 3d 979 (D. Colo. 2018). 
    <P>Nor do the enforcement provisions satisfy the balancing
    test. The provisions diminish first amendment speech and are
    not reasonable because they allow any person to enforce them.
    Holland v. Williams, 457 F. Supp. 3d 979 (D. Colo. 2018).</P>
    <P>
    <B>District court did not abuse its discretion by entering
    preliminary injunction against secretary of state enjoining
    implementation of administrative rule defining "member" for
    purposes of constitutional provisions governing small donor
    committees.</B>Proposed rule would force labor and other
    covered organizations to get written permission before using an
    individual's dues or contributions to fund political campaigns.
    Plaintiffs demonstrated reasonable probability of success on
    the merits in challenging secretary's authority to enact
    proposed rule. Secretary's "definition" of term "member" in
    proposed rule is much more than an effort to define term. It
    can be read effectively to add, modify, and conflict with
    constitutional provision by imposing new condition not found in
    text of article XXVIII. Secretary's stated purpose in enacting
    proposed rule not furthered by "definition" contained in
    proposed rule. Proposed rule does not further secretary's
    stated goal of achieving transparency of political
    contributions. Sanger v. Dennis, 148 P.3d 404 (Colo. App.
    2006).</P>
    <P>
    <B>Plaintiffs demonstrated reasonable probability of success on
    the merits in alleging that administrative rule promulgated by
    secretary of state violated their constitutional rights to
    freedom of association as applied to them.</B>Secretary's
    immediate enforcement of administrative rule forcing labor and
    other covered organizations to get written permission before
    using an individual's dues or contributions to fund political
    campaigns would have effectively prevented plaintiffs from
    exercising their first amendment rights in general election.
    Administrative rule was not narrowly tailored. Rationale
    justifying administrative rule was based upon speculation there
    would be dissenters, thereby impermissibly penalizing
    constitutional rights of the many for the speculative rights of
    the few. Accordingly, district court did not abuse its
    discretion by entering preliminary injunction against
    implementation of administrative rule. Sanger v. Dennis, 148
    P.3d 404 (Colo. App. 2006).</P>

    <B>Adoption of Rule 9.3 of the Colorado secretary of state's
    rules concerning campaign and political finance requiring the
    name of the candidate unambiguously referred to in the
    electioneering communication to be included in the
    electioneering report, was within the rulemaking authority of
    the secretary of state under § 9(1)(b) of article XXVIII of the
    state constitution and subsection (1) of this section.</B>Colo.

    P.3d 1207 (Colo. App. 2008).</P>
    <P>
    <B>ALJ had jurisdiction to impose penalty for violation of Rule
    9.3 and did not err by imposing a $1,000 penalty on political
    committee.</B>Section (2)(a) of article XXVIII of the state
    constitution grants an ALJ authority to conduct hearings on
    alleged violations of the article and the "Fair Campaign
    Practices Act" and to impose penalties if a violation has
    occurred. Rule 9.3 is necessary to implement former § 1-45-109
    (5), and, under § 10(2)(a) of article XXVIII of the state
    constitution, sanctions can be imposed for violations of §
    1-45-109. Colo. Citizens for Ethics in Gov't v. Comm. for the
    Am. Dream, 187 P.3d 1207 (Colo. App. 2008).</P>
    <P>
    <B>ALJ did not err in determining that membership contribution
    claim was groundless and in awarding attorney fees against
    litigant.</B>ALJ did not misinterpret subsection (2) by
    rejecting litigant's defense based on voluntary dismissal of
    its membership contributions claim under § 13-17-102 (5).
    Although § 1-45-111.5 (2) contains the same operative language
    and definitions as § 13-17-102 (4), at the time of the action,
    the FCPA did not incorporate § 13-17-102 (5) and contained no
    exception for dismissal of a groundless claim prior to hearing.
    Moreover, although § 13-17-102 applies to any civil action
    commenced or appealed in any court of record, "court of record"
    does not include administrative courts. Finally, the record
    showed that the ALJ considered litigant's arguments about the
    efforts it made after the filing of the action to reduce or
    dismiss claims it found to be invalid. Colo. Citizens for
    Ethics in Gov't v. Comm. for the Am. Dream, 187 P.3d 1207
    (Colo. App. 2008).</P>
    <P>
    <B>Given that identical terms "substantially frivolous,
    substantially groundless, or substantially vexatious" are found
    in this section and in § 13-17-102, case law construing that
    section may be examined for guidance in construing terms used
    in this section.</B>Colo. Ethics Watch v. Senate Major. Fund,
    275 P.3d 674 (Colo. App. 2010), aff'd on other grounds, 2012 CO

    <P>
    <B>A claim is frivolous if</B>its proponents can present no
    rational argument based on the evidence or the law to support
    it. A claim is vexatious if it is brought or maintained in bad
    faith to annoy or harass another. Colo. Ethics Watch v. Senate
    Major. Fund, 275 P.3d 674 (Colo. App. 2010), aff'd on other
    grounds, 2012 CO 12, 269 P.3d 1248.</P>
    <P>
    <B>Subsection (2) of this section and § 9(2)(a) of article
    XXVIII of the state constitution do not permit a respondent who
    has been awarded attorney fees in an action under the Fair
    Campaign Practices Act (FCPA) to enforce the action in the
    district court.</B>The plain language of subsection (2) and
    subsection 9(2)(a) of article XXVIII read together creates a
    nonreciprocal right to enforce an ALJ's award ordered in a
    campaign finance violation action and leaves a respondent
    without a remedy under either article XXVIII or the FCPA to
    enforce that award. While this may create an unintended result,
    the legislature or the people must determine the remedy and the
    court is not a board of editors with power to rewrite statutes
    or the constitution to improve them. Because respondent was not
    authorized by subsection 9(2)(a) of article XXVIII to seek
    enforcement of the ALJ's attorney fees order in the district
    court, the district court did not err when it dismissed her
    petition for lack of subject matter jurisdiction. McGihon v.

  complaint should not be filed with a hearing officer because
  there is not sufficient information to support the allegations
  contained in the complaint or for any other reason, it shall
  prepare and file with the deputy secretary a motion to dismiss
  the complaint. The deputy secretary shall make a determination on
  the motion to dismiss within thirty-five days of the initial
  determination of the division under this subsection (5)(a)(IV),
  or the initiation of an investigation by the division under
  subsection (7)(b) of this section, which must be provided to the

    <B>Because Colorado Springs, as a home rule municipality,
    enacted a campaign practices ordinance, this section expressly
    provides that neither the campaign finance provisions of the
    state constitution nor this article applies to a complaint
    submitted to the secretary of state (secretary) alleging that
    certain candidates for city council had violated the
    ordinance.</B>Accordingly, an administrative law judge to whom
    the complaint had been forwarded by the secretary lacks subject
    matter jurisdiction over campaign practices arising out of the
    city's elections and properly dismissed the complaint. The
    attempted referral of the complaint to the secretary conflicts
    with the clear intent of the general assembly to exclude home
    rule municipality elections from state disclosure requirements
    when the home rule municipality has adopted its own ordinances
    regulating campaign practices. In re City of Colo. Springs,

    <B>Moneys in fund administered by the Colorado compensation

    into the fund by employers</B>constituted "public moneys" for
    purposes of this section. Denver Area Labor Fed'n v. Buckley,
    924 P.2d 524 (Colo. 1996).</P>
    <P>
    <B>While the term "public moneys" is not defined,</B>the
    all-inclusive language "from any source" indicates that the
    general assembly intended an expansive definition of the
    phrase. Thus, the term "public moneys" may not be construed to
    refer only to sums realized from the imposition of taxes.
    Denver Area Labor Fed'n v. Buckley, 924 P.2d 524 (Colo.
    1996).</P>
    <P>Although moneys collected by the political subdivision were
    not derived from state-imposed sales, use, property, or income
    taxes, those moneys may be spent by the political subdivision
    only for authorized public purposes. The general assembly has
    in essence declared that the expenditure of moneys in the fund
    for purposes prohibited by this section are not authorized
    expenditures for public purposes. Denver Area Labor Fed'n v.
    Buckley, 924 P.2d 524 (Colo. 1996).</P>
    <P>
    <B>This section prohibits the use of "public moneys from any
    source," not the use of "public funds".</B>The general assembly
    thus selected a phrase not previously construed in seeking to
    limit the expenditure of funds by various governmental entities
    for certain purposes. Denver Area Labor Fed'n v. Buckley, 924
    P.2d 524 (Colo. 1996).</P>
    <P>
    <B>This section tends to promote public confidence in
    government</B>by prohibiting the use of moneys authorized for
    expenditure by political subdivisions for specified public
    purposes to advance the personal viewpoint of one group over
    another. A political subdivision's use of moneys that were
    authorized for expenditure for the benefit of an insured to
    oppose the passage of an amendment proposed by an insured is
    the type of conduct the general assembly intended to prohibit
    by the enactment of this section. Denver Area Labor Fed'n v.
    Buckley, 924 P.2d 524 (Colo. 1996).</P>
    <P>
    <B>Subsection (4), and not § 10(1) of article XXVIII of state
    constitution, provides basis for sanctions against special
    district that allegedly violated subsection (1)(b)(I) by urging
    voters to support ballot issue.</B>Plaintiff's sole argument to
    ALJ was that special district violated subsection (1)(b)(I) by
    urging voters to support ballot issue. Plaintiff made no
    argument that expenditure violated a contribution or spending
    limit nor did plaintiff make any other argument concerning the
    amount district spent. Sherritt v. Rocky Mtn. Fire Dist., 205
    P.3d 544 (Colo. App. 2009).</P>
    <P>
    <B>No abuse of discretion by administrative law judge (ALJ) in
    refusing to sanction special district at higher amount
    requested by plaintiff.</B>Under subsection (4), ALJ had
    discretion to determine "any appropriate order or relief". In
    sanctioning district, ALJ cited district's attempt to comply
    with the law and the absence of prior violations. ALJ found
    that public funds would be used to satisfy the penalty and,
    therefore, a large fine would compound the problem. In
    exercising his or her discretion, ALJ properly considered needs
    of the public. Additionally, ALJ's findings have record support
    and were neither arbitrary, capricious, unsupported by the
    evidence, nor contrary to law. Sherritt v. Rocky Mtn. Fire
    Dist., 205 P.3d 544 (Colo. App. 2009).</P>
    <P>
    <B>What is of "official concern" to school district board of
    education</B>is to be determined by reference to the official
    powers and duties delegated by the general assembly in the
    school laws. Mtn. States Legal Found. v. Denver Sch. Dist. No.
    1, 459 F. Supp. 357 (D. Colo. 1978).</P>
    <P>A matter of official concern is one which at the very least
    involves questions which come before the officials for an
    official decision. Campbell v. Joint Dist. 28-J, 704 F.2d 501

    <P>
    <B>Proposed constitutional amendment not of official
    concern.</B>A proposed amendment to the state constitution on a
    general election ballot is not a matter of official concern.
    Campbell v. Joint Dist. 28-J, 704 F.2d 501 (10th Cir.
    1983).</P>
    <P>
    <B>Not determined solely by board.</B>The characterization of a
    campaign issue as being of "official concern" is not a judgment
    which can be made solely by the board of education; such an
    interpretation of this section would give unlimited discretion
    to the school board to use school funds and school facilities
    whenever it suited the personal preference of the majority of
    the members. Mtn. States Legal Found. v. Denver Sch. Dist. No.
    1, 459 F. Supp. 357 (D. Colo. 1978).</P>
    <P>
    <B>This section allows an employee with policy-making
    responsibility to expend public funds up to the $50 limit</B>in
    expressing an opinion about a pending ballot issue. Regents of
    the Univ. of Colo. v. Meyer, 899 P.2d 316 (Colo. App.
    1995).</P>
    <P>
    <B>Paid staff time is a contribution in kind for purposes of
    this section.</B>Time spent by the state treasurer's staff
    during work hours on a non-volunteer basis preparing and
    disseminating press releases expressing the state treasurer's
    opposition to a statewide ballot issue therefore violated this
    section to the extent that the value of that time exceeded $50.
    Coffman v. Colo. Common Cause, 102 P.3d 999 (Colo. 2004).</P>
    <P>
    <B>State treasurer's press conference and press releases
    opposing a statewide ballot issue violated this section.</B>The
    press releases were not balanced factual summaries of the
    ballot issue and were not resolutions because they were not
    formal expressions of a voting body. The state treasurer
    expended more than $50 in preparing the press releases and was
    not permitted to expend more than that to take a position of
    advocacy. Colo. Common Cause v. Coffman, 85 P.3d 551 (Colo.
    App. 2003), aff'd, 102 P.3d 999 (Colo. 2004).</P>
    <P>
    <B>Public school payroll deduction system for teachers' union
    dues, a portion of which was given by the union to a political
    action committee,</B>did not constitute a "contribution in
    kind" because it did not support a specific "issue" or
    "candidate" that the political action committee supported or
    opposed during the time that the district made the payroll
    deductions. Mtn. States v. Secretary of State, 946 P.2d 586
    (Colo. App. 1997) (decided under law in effect prior to 1997
    amendment).</P>
    <P>
    <B>Brochure mailed by metropolitan districts explaining
    proposed improvements violated this section.</B>The brochure,
    when read in its entirety, did not present arguments for and
    against the issue. In fact, it took a position exclusively in
    favor of the issue, presented no contrary arguments, and
    expressly advocated the passage of the bond initiative that was
    titled only days after the mailing of the brochure. Thus, it
    urged voters to vote for the initiative. Skruch v. Highlands
    Ranch Metro. Dists., 107 P.3d 1140 (Colo. App. 2004).</P>
    <P>Although brochure did not mention ballot initiative by name,
    administrative law judge appropriately concluded that the
    language of this section does not require that level of
    specificity. The section prohibits "the urging of electors to
    vote a certain way." Skruch v. Highlands Ranch Metro. Dists.,
    107 P.3d 1140 (Colo. App. 2004).</P>
    <P>
    <B>School district did not make a prohibited contribution to a
    campaign under § 2(5)(a)(IV) of article XXVIII and subsection
    (1)(a)(I) of this section.</B>A research report from a national
    think tank supportive of a school district's educational reform
    efforts that the district commissioned and paid for with public
    funds constitutes a "thing of value" for purposes of the
    definition of "contribution". The district did not make a
    prohibited contribution to a campaign, however, when it broadly
    disseminated an email of the report to county residents.
    Something of value is not given to a candidate when it is
    publicly distributed, even if the candidate happens to be among
    the public to which the thing of value has been made available.
    Keim v. Douglas County Sch. Dist., 2017 CO 81, 397 P.3d
    377.</P></ANNO-TEXT>
