  <M>Except as otherwise provided in part 4 of this article for
  commercial drivers, no person shall drive any motor vehicle upon
  a highway in this state unless such person has been issued a
  currently valid driver's or minor driver's license or an
  instruction permit by the department under this article.</M>
  <P N="(2)">(2)
  <M>No person shall drive any motor vehicle upon a highway in this
  state if such person's driver's or minor driver's license has
  been expired for one year or less and such person has not been
  issued another such license by the department or by another state
  or country subsequent to such expiration.</M></P>
  <P N="(3)">(3)
  <M>No person shall drive any motor vehicle upon a highway in this
  state unless such person has in his or her immediate possession a
  current driver's or minor driver's license or an instruction
  permit issued by the department under this article.</M></P>
  <P N="(4)">(4)
  <M>No person who has been issued a currently valid driver's or
  minor driver's license or an instruction permit shall drive a
  type or general class of motor vehicle upon a highway in this
  state for which such person has not been issued the correct type
  or general class of license or permit.</M></P>
  <P N="(5)">(5)
  <M>No person who has been issued a currently valid driver's or
  minor driver's license or an instruction permit shall operate a
  motor vehicle upon a highway in this state without having such
  license or permit in such person's immediate possession.</M></P>
  <P N="(6)">(6)
  <M>A charge of a violation of subsection (2) of this section
  shall be dismissed by the court if the defendant elects not to
  pay the penalty assessment and, at or before the defendant's
  scheduled court appearance, exhibits to the court a currently
  valid driver's or minor driver's license.</M></P>
  <P N="(7)">(7)
  <M>A charge of a violation of subsection (5) of this section
  shall be dismissed by the court if the defendant elects not to
  pay the penalty assessment and, at or before the defendant's
  scheduled court appearance, exhibits to the court a currently
  valid license or permit issued to such person or an officially
  issued duplicate thereof if the original is lost, stolen, or
  destroyed.</M></P>
  <P N="(8)">(8)
  <M>The conduct of a driver of a motor vehicle which would
  otherwise constitute a violation of this section is justifiable
  and not unlawful when:</M></P>
  <P N="(8)(a)">(a)
  <M>It is necessary as an emergency measure to avoid an imminent
  public or private injury which is about to occur by reason of a
  situation occasioned or developed through no conduct of said
  driver and which is of sufficient gravity that, according to
  ordinary standards of intelligence and morality, the desirability
  and urgency of avoiding the injury clearly outweigh the
  desirability of avoiding the injury sought to be prevented by
  this section; or</M></P>
  <P N="(8)(b)">(b)
  <M>The applicable conditions for exemption, as set forth in
  section 42-2-102, exist.</M></P>
  <P N="(9)">(9)
  <M>The issue of justification or exemption is an affirmative
  defense. As used in this subsection (9), "affirmative defense"
  means that, unless the state's evidence raises the issue
  involving the particular defense, the defendant, to raise the
  issue, shall present some credible evidence on that issue. If the
  issue involved in an affirmative defense is raised, then the
  liability of the defendant must be established beyond a
  reasonable doubt as to that issue as well as all other elements
  of the traffic infraction.</M></P>
  <P N="(10)">(10)
  <M>Any person who violates any provision of subsection (1) or (4)
  of this section commits a class A traffic infraction. Any person
  who violates any provision of subsection (2), (3), or (5) of this
  section commits a class B traffic infraction.</M></P>
  <P N="(11)">(11)
  <M>Notwithstanding any law to the contrary, a second or
  subsequent conviction under subsection (1) or (4) of this
  section, when a person receiving such conviction has not
  subsequently obtained a valid Colorado driver's license or the
  correct type or general class of license, shall result in the
  assessment by the department of six points against the driving
  privilege of the person receiving such second or subsequent
  conviction.</M></P></SECTION-TEXT>

  <M>A person who is sixteen years of age or older and who, except

  or motorcycle, would otherwise be qualified to obtain a license
  under this article may apply for a temporary instruction permit
  in accordance with sections 42-2-107 and 42-2-108. The department
  shall issue a permit entitling an applicant, who is sixteen years
  of age or older but under eighteen years of age, while having the
  permit in the applicant's immediate possession, to drive a motor
  vehicle or motorcycle upon the highways when accompanied by the
  parent, stepparent, grandparent with power of attorney, or
  guardian or foster parent, who signed the affidavit of liability
  pursuant to section 42-2-108 (1)(a), who holds a valid Colorado

  proximity to the driver or, in the case of a motorcycle, under
  the immediate proximate supervision of a licensed driver, who
  holds a valid Colorado driver's license and is twenty-one years
  of age or older, authorized under this article to drive a
  motorcycle. In addition, the parent, stepparent, grandparent with
  power of attorney, or guardian or foster parent, who is
  authorized pursuant to this section to supervise the minor driver
  while the minor is driving, may allow the minor, while having the
  permit in the applicant's immediate possession, to drive with an
  individual who holds a valid driver's license and is twenty-one
  years of age or older for additional driving experience, but such
  additional driving experience shall not count toward the
  requirement established in section 42-2-104. The permit shall
  expire three years after issuance. The department shall issue a

    <P>
    <B>Legislative intent.</B>While granting minors under the age
    of 18 the opportunity to gain experience in driving an
    automobile and granting them the privilege of using the public
    highways, the general assembly sought by this section to
    safeguard against the indiscretions of the inexperienced,
    youthful driver by requiring a financially responsible adult to
    assume the liability for accidents negligently or willfully
    caused by the youth. This was done, first, with the hope, that,
    having assumed the liability, the parent or guardian would
    exercise some degree of control over the minor's driving
    habits, and, second, to insure that the innocent victim of such
    negligence would be compensated for his injuries. Bilsten v.
    Porter, 33 Colo. App. 208, 516 P.2d 656 (1973); Lahey v.
    Benjou, 759 P.2d 855 (Colo. App. 1988).</P>
    <P>
    <B>Strict construction.</B>This section, in derogation of the
    common law, is to be strictly construed. Bilsten v. Porter, 33
    Colo. App. 208, 516 P.2d 656 (1973).</P>
    <P>
    <B>The statutory language of this section itself contains no
    express limitations on the parent's liability,</B>and this is
    true whether or not the minor has disobeyed the terms of his
    temporary instruction license. Bilsten v. Porter, 33 Colo. App.
    208, 516 P.2d 656 (1973).</P>

    <B>Effect of ยง 42-2-102 (1)(d).</B>Subsection (1) only requires
    that the licensee be accompanied at the hearing by the person
    who signed the application of the minor, unless that person
    submits a verified statement. However, where licensees have
    never been required to apply for licenses in the state of
    Colorado, by virtue of ยง 42-2-102 (1)(d), and since no person
    was required to sign their applications, no one is required to

  <M>Any notice or order required to be served under the provisions
  of the motor vehicle laws may be served in any manner reasonably
  designed to notify the person to be served of the material
  provisions of such notice or order. A person has been served with
  a notice or order when such person has knowledge of the material
  provisions of such notice or order, regardless of the manner in
  which such knowledge was acquired. Any irregularity in the form
  or manner of service or documentation of the proof of service or
  the means by which knowledge of the material provisions of a
  notice or order is acquired shall not affect the validity of such
  notice or order.</M>
  <P N="(2)">(2)
  <M>For purposes of notices or orders relating to driving
  restraints only, "material provisions" means those provisions
  which identify the affected person, and those provisions which
  state that a restraint against the person's license or privilege
  to drive in this state has been, or will be, entered on the
  records of the department, or those provisions which advise the
  person that he or she has a right to request a hearing regarding
  the imposition of a restraint against such person's license or
  privilege to drive.</M></P>
  <P N="(3)">(3)
  <M>The department shall develop proof of service forms which may
  be used to document proof of service under this subsection (3).
  Such forms shall include but need not be limited to the

  <M>The name and date of birth of the person served;</M></P>
  <P N="(3)(b)">(b)

  prosecutor, or any municipal, county or district court judge,
  magistrate, or judicial officer. If service is personally made
  under this subsection (4), proof of such service of any notice or
  order may be made by sending a written notification of service in
  any form to the department. Such notification shall be an
  official record of the department under section 42-2-121. It
  shall not be necessary that the written notification is on a form

  <M>Except as otherwise provided, whenever any person is convicted
  of any offense for which this article makes mandatory the
  revocation or suspension of the driver's or minor driver's
  license of such person by the department, the court in which such
  conviction is had shall require the offender to immediately
  surrender such driver's or minor driver's license or any
  instruction permit to the court at the time of conviction, and
  the court shall, not later than ten days after such conviction,
  forward the license to the department, together with a record of
  such conviction on the form prescribed by the department. Any
  person who does not immediately surrender such person's license
  or permit to the court commits a class 2 misdemeanor traffic
  offense, unless such person swears or affirms under oath
  administered by the court and subject to the penalties of perjury
  that the license or permit has been lost, destroyed, or is not in
  said person's immediate possession. Any person who swears or
  affirms that the license or permit is not in the immediate
  possession of said person shall surrender said license or permit
  to the court within five days of the sworn or affirmed statement,
  and if not surrendered within such time, said person commits a
  class 2 misdemeanor traffic offense.</M>
  <P N="(1)(b)">(b)
  <M>Whenever the driver's history of any person shows that such
  driver is required to maintain financial responsibility for the
  future and is unable to show to the court that the driver is
  maintaining the required financial responsibility for the future,
  the court shall require the immediate surrender to it of the
  driver's, minor driver's, or temporary driver's license or any
  instruction permit held by such person, and the court, within
  forty-eight hours after receiving the license, shall forward the
  license to the department with the form prescribed by the

  federal military installation in this state shall forward to the
  department a record of the conviction of any person in said court
  or by said authority for a violation of any said laws not later
  than ten days after the day of sentencing for such conviction and
  may recommend the suspension or retention of the driver's, minor
  driver's, or temporary driver's license or any instruction permit
  of the person so convicted.</M></P>
  <P N="(3)">(3)
  <M>For the purposes of this section, the term "convicted" or
  "conviction" means a sentence imposed following a plea of guilty
  or nolo contendere, a verdict of guilty by the court or a jury,
  or an adjudication of a delinquency under title 19, C.R.S. The
  payment of a penalty assessment under the provisions of section
  42-4-1701 shall also be considered a conviction if the summons
  states clearly the points to be assessed for that offense.
  Whenever suspension or revocation of a license is authorized or
  required for conviction of any offense under state law, a final
  finding of guilty of a violation of a municipal ordinance
  governing a substantially equivalent offense in a city, town, or
  city and county shall, for purposes of such suspension or
  revocation, be deemed and treated as a conviction of the
  corresponding offense under state law. A stay of sentence,

  pending any final determination of a conviction on
  appeal.</M></P>

    <B>Due process standard for using penalty assessment as

    the mandatory requirements of this section, and defendant's
    acceptance of the notices in the form tendered and his payment
    of the fines stated therein may not be considered a conviction

    <B>Court must state points assessable before guilty plea.</B>A
    traffic violation conviction is insufficient for the purpose of
    assessing points against the licensee where municipal court

    assessed upon a plea of guilty. Dunn v. Tice, 43 Colo. App. 55,
    598 P.2d 530 (1979).</P>
    <P>
    <B>When points not assessable.</B>If a traffic violation does

    the traffic violation, points cannot be assessed against him
    for that offense. Stortz v. Colo. Dept. of Rev., 195 Colo. 325,

    <P>
    <B>Disparity in eligibility for probationary license held
    constitutional.</B>Although under the implied consent law a
    person refusing to submit to a chemical test is subject to a
    mandatory revocation without any opportunity for a probationary
    license, while a person actually convicted of driving under the
    influence is subject to a mandatory revocation but nonetheless
    may apply for a probationary license, this disparity in
    treatment does not violate equal protection of the laws. Drake
    v. Colo. Dept. of Rev., 674 P.2d 359 (Colo. 1984).</P>
    <P>
    <B>Revocation of license no burden on right to travel
    interstate.</B>While the right to travel interstate is without
    question a fundamental right under the United States
    constitution, revocation of a driver's license pursuant to this
    section does not burden this fundamental right. Heninger v.
    Charnes, 200 Colo. 194, 613 P.2d 884 (1980).</P>
    <P>
    <B>Primary purpose of this section</B>and ยงยง 42-2-121 and

    Heil v. Charnes, 44 Colo. App. 225, 616 P.2d 980 (1980).</P>
    <P>The implied consent statute serves the distinct governmental
    purpose of facilitating citizen cooperation in achieving
    traffic safety by the use of the administrative sanction of
    revocation upon a refusal to submit to a test, while the
    statutory authorization for a probationary license is expressly
    directed towards the "alcohol and drug traffic driving
    education or treatment" of the convicted traffic offender.
    DeScala v. Motor Vehicle Div., 667 P.2d 1360 (Colo. 1983).</P>
    <P>
    <B>Laws aimed at drivers under influence of alcohol.</B>The
    traffic laws and the revocation procedures contained in this
    section and ยง 42-2-203 are aimed at all drivers who operate a
    motor vehicle while under the influence of alcohol or while
    their ability is impaired, regardless of their status as
    alcoholics or problem drinkers. Heninger v. Charnes, 200 Colo.
    194, 613 P.2d 884 (1980).</P>
    <P>
    <B>Proceeding not barred by one-year delay.</B>A one-year delay
    in commencing these administrative proceedings pursuant to ยง
    42-2-123 does not ipso facto constitute a bar to the hearing.

    1982).</P>

    <B>Issuance of driver's license does not confer upon licensee
    right that is independently entitled to protection</B>against
    any and all governmental interference or restriction. Heninger
    v. Charnes, 200 Colo. 194, 613 P.2d 884 (1980).</P>
    <P>
    <B>Categorization of alcohol-related driving offenses
    reasonably related to governmental interest.</B>To the extent
    that one might consider as a classification the categorization
    of alcohol-related driving offenses in subsections (1)(g) and
    (1)(i), and ยง 42-2-202 (2)(a)(I), such classification is
    reasonably related to the expressed governmental interest of
    providing maximum safety for all persons who travel or
    otherwise use the public highway. Heninger v. Charnes, 200
    Colo. 194, 613 P.2d 884 (1980) (decided prior to the 1981
    amendment to subsections (1)(g) and (1)(i)).</P>
    <P>
    <B>Where a driver's license has been revoked, it continues
    revoked until a new license has been granted,</B>and such
    revocation does not terminate with the expiration date of the
    license. People v. Lopez, 143 Colo. 523, 354 P.2d 491
    (1960).</P>
    <P>
    <B>Completion of alcohol education program was not mitigating
    factor</B>to be considered in granting or denial of
    probationary driver's license, but rather was prerequisite for
    application. Hoth v. Charnes, 736 P.2d 1264 (Colo. App.
    1987).</P>
    <P>
    <B>Former subsection (4) of this section required</B>the
    completion of a Level II alcohol treatment program as a
    prerequisite to the issuance of a probationary license for a
    driver twice convicted of driving under the influence of
    alcohol within a five-year period. Smith v. Dept. of Rev., 793
    P.2d 611 (Colo. App. 1990) (decided under law in effect prior
    to 1990 repeal and reenactment of subsection (4)).</P>
    <P>
    <B>Probationary license sought pursuant to former subsection
    (4) was properly denied</B>since the original revocation period
    expired for driver twice convicted of driving under the
    influence of alcohol within five years and driver was eligible
    for reinstatement, notwithstanding the fact the revocation
    remained in effect until the driver completed Level II alcohol
    treatment. Smith v. Dept. of Rev., 793 P.2d 611 (Colo. App.
    1990) (decided under law in effect prior to 1990 repeal and
    reenactment of subsection (4)).</P>
    <P>
    <B>The application of the 1990 amendments to deny a
    probationary license</B>was not unlawful as being retroactive
    in operation or in violation of defendant's vested rights
    because the revocation and probationary license issues were not
    triggered until defendant's criminal convictions occurred after
    the effective date of the 1990 amendments. Rogers v. Dept. of
    Rev., 841 P.2d 369 (Colo. App. 1992).</P>
    <P>
    <B>Indefinite revocation is a remedial action</B>designed to
    assure the general public safety in the use of its highways and
    is not cruel and unusual punishment. Campbell v. State, 176
    Colo. 202, 491 P.2d 1385 (1971).</P>
    <P>
    <B>Notice need not give facts warranting revocation to be
    adequate.</B>The notice received from the division of motor
    vehicles is not defective because it does not give adequate
    notice of the facts warranting revocation unless the driver was
    genuinely surprised. Campbell v. State, 176 Colo. 202, 491 P.2d
    1385 (1971).</P>
    <P>
    <B>The function of the hearing examiner under this statute is
    purely ministerial.</B>Campbell v. State, 176 Colo. 202, 491
    P.2d 1385 (1971).</P>
    <P>
    <B>Revocation proper even though offenses occurred prior to
    amendment.</B>Application of the mandatory revocation provision
    of subsection (1)(g) is not improper even though only one of
    the offenses upon which the revocation of the license is based
    occurred after the effective date of the 1981 amendment.
    Sanchez v. State, Dept. of Rev., 667 P.2d 779 (Colo. 1983).</P>

    <P>
    <B>There is no due process violation in suspending the driver's
    license of any person convicted of any felony drug
    offense.</B>The sanction is reasonably related to the

    <B>Requirement to surrender license to the court upon

  <B>Initial determination and notice of revocation.</B>(a)
  <M>Upon receipt of an affidavit of a law enforcement officer and
  the relevant documents required by paragraph (a) of subsection
  (5) of this section, the department shall determine whether the
  person's license should be revoked under subsection (3) of this
  section. The determination shall be based upon the information
  contained in the affidavit and the relevant documents submitted
  to the department, and the determination shall be final unless a
  hearing is requested and held as provided in subsection (8) of
  this section. The determination of these facts by the department
  is independent of the determination of a court of the same or
  similar facts in the adjudication of any criminal charges arising
  out of the same occurrence. The disposition of the criminal
  charges shall not affect any revocation under this
  section.</M></P>
  <P N="(6)(b)(I)">(b)
  <N></N>(I)
  <M>If the department determines that the person is subject to
  license revocation, the department shall issue a notice of
  revocation if a notice has not already been served upon the
  person by the law enforcement officer as provided in paragraph
  (b) of subsection (5) of this section. A notice of revocation
  shall clearly specify the reason and statutory grounds for the
  revocation, the effective date of the revocation, the right of
  the person to request a hearing, the procedure for requesting a
  hearing, and the date by which a request for a hearing must be
  made.</M></P>
  <P N="(6)(b)(II)">(II)
  <M>In sending a notice of revocation, the department shall mail
  the notice in accordance with the provisions of section 42-2-119
  (2) to the person at the last-known address shown on the
  department's records, if any, and to any address provided in the
  law enforcement officer's affidavit if that address differs from
  the address of record. The notice shall be deemed received three
  days after mailing.</M></P>
  <P N="(6)(c)">(c)
  <M>If the department determines that the person is not subject to
  license revocation, the department shall notify the person of its
  determination and shall rescind any order of revocation served
  upon the person by the law enforcement officer.</M></P>
  <P N="(6)(d)">(d)
  <M>A license revocation shall become effective seven days after
  the person has received the notice of revocation as provided in
  subsection (5) of this section or is deemed to have received the
  notice of revocation by mail as provided in paragraph (b) of this
  subsection (6). If the department receives a written request for
  a hearing pursuant to subsection (7) of this section within that
  same seven-day period and the department issues a temporary
  permit pursuant to paragraph (d) of subsection (7) of this
  section, the effective date of the revocation shall be stayed
  until a final order is issued following the hearing; except that
  any delay in the hearing that is caused or requested by the
  person or counsel representing the person shall not result in a
  stay of the revocation during the period of delay.</M></P>
  <P N="(7)(a)">(7)
  <M></M>
  <B>Request for hearing.</B>(a)
  <M>A person who has received a notice of revocation may make a
  written request for a review of the department's determination at
  a hearing. The request may be made on a form available at each
  office of the department.</M></P>
  <P N="(7)(b)">(b)
  <M>A person must request a hearing in writing within seven days
  after the day the person receives the notice of revocation as
  provided in subsection (5) of this section or is deemed to have
  received the notice by mail as provided in paragraph (b) of
  subsection (6) of this section. If the department does not
  receive the written request for a hearing within the seven-day
  period, the right to a hearing is waived, and the determination
  of the department that is based on the documents and affidavit
  required by subsection (5) of this section becomes final.</M></P>
  <P N="(7)(c)">(c)
  <M>If a person submits a written request for a hearing after
  expiration of the seven-day period and if the request is
  accompanied by the person's verified statement explaining the
  failure to make a timely request for a hearing, the department
  shall receive and consider the request. If the department finds
  that the person was unable to make a timely request due to lack
  of actual notice of the revocation or due to factors of physical
  incapacity such as hospitalization or incarceration, the
  department shall waive the period of limitation, reopen the
  matter, and grant the hearing request. In such a case, the
  department shall not grant a stay of the revocation pending
  issuance of the final order following the hearing.</M></P>
  <P N="(7)(d)">(d)
  <M>At the time a person requests a hearing pursuant to this
  subsection (7), if it appears from the record that the person is
  the holder of a valid driver's or minor driver's license or of an
  instruction permit or of a temporary permit issued pursuant to
  paragraph (b) of subsection (5) of this section and that the
  license or permit has been surrendered, the department shall stay
  the effective date of the revocation and issue a temporary permit
  that shall be valid until the scheduled date for the hearing. If
  necessary, the department may later extend the temporary permit
  or issue an additional temporary permit in order to stay the
  effective date of the revocation until the final order is issued
  following the hearing, as required by subsection (8) of this
  section. If the person notifies the department in writing at the
  time that the hearing is requested that the person desires the
  law enforcement officer's presence at the hearing, the department
  shall issue a written notice for the law enforcement officer to
  appear at the hearing. A law enforcement officer who is required
  to appear at a hearing may, at the discretion of the hearing
  officer, appear in real time by telephone or other electronic
  means in accordance with section 42-1-218.5.</M></P>
  <P N="(7)(e)">(e)
  <M>At the time that a person requests a hearing, the department
  shall provide to the person written notice advising the
  person:</M></P>
  <P N="(7)(e)(I)">(I)
  <M>Of the right to subpoena the law enforcement officer for the
  hearing and that the subpoena must be served upon the law
  enforcement officer at least five calendar days prior to the
  hearing;</M></P>
  <P N="(7)(e)(II)">(II)
  <M>Of the person's right at that time to notify the department in
  writing that the person desires the law enforcement officer's
  presence at the hearing and that, upon receiving the
  notification, the department shall issue a written notice for the
  law enforcement officer to appear at the hearing;</M></P>
  <P N="(7)(e)(III)">(III)
  <M>That, if the law enforcement officer is not required to appear
  at the hearing, documents and an affidavit prepared and submitted
  by the law enforcement officer will be used at the hearing;
  and</M></P>
  <P N="(7)(e)(IV)">(IV)
  <M>That the affidavit and documents submitted by the law
  enforcement officer may be reviewed by the person prior to the
  hearing.</M></P>
  <P N="(7)(f)">(f)
  <M>Any subpoena served upon a law enforcement officer for
  attendance at a hearing conducted pursuant to this section shall
  be served at least five calendar days before the day of the
  hearing.</M></P>
  <P N="(8)">(8)
  <M></M>
  <B>Hearing.</B>(a)
  <N></N>(I)
  <M>The hearing shall be scheduled to be held as quickly as
  practicable but not more than sixty days after the date the
  department receives the request for a hearing; except that, if a
  hearing is rescheduled because of the unavailability of a law
  enforcement officer or the hearing officer in accordance with
  subsection (8)(a)(III) or (8)(a)(IV) of this section, the hearing
  may be rescheduled more than sixty days after the date the
  department receives the request for the hearing, and the
  department shall continue any temporary driving privileges held
  by the person until the date to which the hearing is rescheduled.
  At least ten days prior to the scheduled or rescheduled hearing,
  the department shall provide in the manner specified in section
  42-2-119 (2) a written notice of the time and place of the
  hearing to the respondent unless the parties agree to waive this
  requirement. Notwithstanding the provisions of sections 42-1-102
  and 42-2-119, the last-known address of the respondent for
  purposes of notice for any hearing pursuant to this section is
  the address stated on the hearing request form.</M></P>
  <P N="(8)(a)(II)">(II)
  <M>A law enforcement officer who submits the documents and
  affidavit required by subsection (5) of this section need not be
  present at the hearing unless the hearing officer requires that
  the law enforcement officer be present and the hearing officer
  issues a written notice for the law enforcement officer's
  appearance or unless the respondent or the respondent's attorney
  determines that the law enforcement officer should be present and
  serves a timely subpoena upon the law enforcement officer in
  accordance with paragraph (f) of subsection (7) of this
  section.</M></P>
  <P N="(8)(a)(III)">(III)
  <M>If a law enforcement officer, after receiving a notice or
  subpoena to appear from either the department or the respondent,
  is unable to appear at the original or rescheduled hearing date
  due to a reasonable conflict, including but not limited to
  training, vacation, or personal leave time, the law enforcement
  officer or the law enforcement officer's supervisor shall contact
  the department not less than forty-eight hours prior to the
  hearing and reschedule the hearing to a time when the law
  enforcement officer will be available. If the law enforcement
  officer cannot appear at the original or rescheduled hearing
  because of medical reasons, a law enforcement emergency, another
  court or administrative hearing, or any other legitimate, just
  cause as determined by the department, and the law enforcement
  officer or the law enforcement officer's supervisor gives notice
  of the law enforcement officer's inability to appear to the
  department prior to the dismissal of the revocation proceeding,
  the department shall reschedule the hearing following
  consultation with the law enforcement officer or the law
  enforcement officer's supervisor at the earliest possible time
  when the law enforcement officer and the hearing officer will be
  available.</M></P>
  <P N="(8)(a)(IV)">(IV)
  <M>If a hearing officer cannot appear at an original or
  rescheduled hearing because of medical reasons, a law enforcement
  emergency, another court or administrative hearing, or any other
  legitimate, just cause, the hearing officer or the department may
  reschedule the hearing at the earliest possible time when the law
  enforcement officer and the hearing officer will be
  available.</M></P>
  <P N="(8)(b)">(b)
  <M>The hearing shall be held in the district office nearest to
  where the violation occurred, unless the parties agree to a
  different location; except that, at the discretion of the

  time, by telephone or other electronic means in accordance with
  section 42-1-218.5.</M></P>
  <P N="(8)(c)">(c)
  <M>The department shall consider all relevant evidence at the
  hearing, including the testimony of any law enforcement officer
  and the reports of any law enforcement officer that are submitted
  to the department. The report of a law enforcement officer shall
  not be required to be made under oath, but the report shall
  identify the law enforcement officer making the report. The
  department may consider evidence contained in affidavits from
  persons other than the respondent, so long as the affidavits
  include the affiant's home or work address and phone number and
  are dated, signed, and sworn to by the affiant under penalty of
  perjury. The affidavit need not be notarized or sworn to before
  any other person.</M></P>

  <P N="(8)(e)">(e)
  <M>When an analysis of the respondent's BAC is considered at a

  <P N="(8)(e)(I)">(I)
  <M>If the respondent establishes, by a preponderance of the
  evidence, that the respondent consumed alcohol between the time
  that the respondent stopped driving and the time of testing, the
  preponderance of the evidence must also establish that the
  minimum required BAC was reached as a result of alcohol consumed
  before the respondent stopped driving; and</M></P>
  <P N="(8)(e)(II)">(II)
  <M>If the evidence offered by the respondent shows a disparity
  between the results of the analysis done on behalf of the law
  enforcement agency and the results of an analysis done on behalf
  of the respondent, and a preponderance of the evidence
  establishes that the blood analysis conducted on behalf of the
  law enforcement agency was properly conducted by a qualified
  person associated with a laboratory certified by the department
  of public health and environment using properly working testing
  devices, there shall be a presumption favoring the accuracy of
  the analysis done on behalf of the law enforcement agency if the
  analysis showed the BAC to be 0.096 or more. If the respondent
  offers evidence of blood analysis, the respondent shall be
  required to state under oath the number of analyses done in
  addition to the one offered as evidence and the names of the
  laboratories that performed the analyses and the results of all
  analyses.</M></P>
  <P N="(8)(f)">(f)
  <M>The hearing shall be recorded. The hearing officer shall

  <B>Appeal.</B>(a)
  <M>Within thirty-five days after the department issues its final

  <P N="(9)(b)">(b)
  <M>Judicial review of the department's determination shall be on

  determination that is unsupported by the evidence in the record,
  the court may reverse the department's determination.</M></P>
  <P N="(9)(c)">(c)
  <M>A filing of a petition for judicial review shall not result in

    <B>This section does not violate constitutional guarantees of
    equal protection of the law,</B>even though a person whose
    driver's license was suspended administratively through ยง
    42-2-122.1 could not receive a probationary license and a
    person whose license was suspended under ยง 42-2-123 as a result
    of a criminal conviction could receive a probationary license,
    because the court, after making a determination of whether
    persons allegedly subject to disparate treatment by these
    sections were in fact similarly situated, found that no
    classification of persons similarly situated exists since this
    section involved an administrative suspension as opposed to a
    suspension resulting from a criminal conviction. Bath v. State
    Dept. of Rev., 758 P.2d 1381 (Colo. 1988); Hancock v. State

    <B>The phrase "without additional testimony" precludes a
    judgment on the grounds that the department of revenue failed

    <B>Statute proscribing driving with a blood alcohol content in
    excess of set limit provides sufficient notice of proscribed

    <P>
    <B>Statute is remedial not punitive, and double jeopardy
    protection does not apply.</B>Revocation occurred because
    defendant refused to take the test for blood alcohol and not
    because of the level of alcohol in his bloodstream.
    Consequently, defendant was arrested for conduct different from
    the conduct giving rise to the license revocation, that is,
    driving a motor vehicle while impaired by the consumption of
    alcohol, as opposed to a refusal to take the test. People v.

    <B>Legality of initial stop and arrest for DUI are proper

    <B>"Probable cause" in the context of this section</B>as it
    existed before the 2013 amendment refers to the quantum and

    issue a notice of driver's license revocation, not whether the
    officer's initial contact with the driver was lawful. Francen
    v. Dept. of Rev., 2014 CO 54, 328 P.3d 111; Hanson v. Dept. of

    <P>
    <B>In determining validity of an investigatory stop,</B>the
    first inquiry is whether there were specific and articulable
    facts known to the police officer which, taken together with
    rational inferences from these facts, created a reasonable
    suspicion of criminal activity. Peterson v. Tipton, 833 P.2d
    830 (Colo. App. 1992).</P>
    <P>
    <B>Officer need not include reasons for driver's erratic
    driving behavior</B>in report but only that the driving was
    erratic and thus the officer had probable cause to stop the
    auto. Kollodge v. Charnes, 741 P.2d 1260 (Colo. App. 1987).</P>
    <P>
    <B>Jurisdiction is acquired in a license revocation proceeding
    under this section</B>when affidavits and other documents
    forwarded by the arresting officer contain sufficient
    information of a reliable character to make a revocation
    determination. Duckett v. Tipton, 826 P.2d 873 (Colo. App.
    1992).</P>
    <P>
    <B>Although arresting officer's failure to swear to the
    affirmation on a revocation form under penalty of perjury
    violated statutory requirement,</B>such violation does not
    prevent department of revenue from acquiring jurisdiction in
    license revocation proceeding and does not warrant reversal of
    revocation. Duckett v. Tipton, 826 P.2d 873 (Colo. App.
    1992).</P>
    <P>
    <B>Where arresting officer swore to validity of documents
    submitted at revocation hearing,</B>any error in the

    <P>
    <B>Statute does not require arresting officer to have personal

    <P>
    <B>Investigating officer's hearsay report</B>as to the time
    that the driver was behind the wheel of the motor vehicle could
    be used to establish timeliness of blood alcohol test without
    violating due process because such report was reliable,
    trustworthy, and possessed probative value. Colo. Div. of Rev.
    v. Lounsbury, 743 P.2d 23 (Colo. 1987); Charnes v. Olona, 743
    P.2d 36 (Colo. 1987).</P>
    <P>
    <B>Revocation of driver's license upheld</B>where substantial

    <P>
    <B>Invalidity of "20% rule".</B>Use of rule which provides that
    a second intoxilyzer test result within 20% of the first test
    result supports and does not refute the first test result was
    invalid as a standard or guide in adjudicatory hearings under
    this article, since it had the effect of an agency rule or
    regulation, but was not promulgated according to the
    rule-making authority delegated to the director of the
    department of revenue. Charnes v. Robinson, 772 P.2d 62 (Colo.
    1989).</P>
    <P>
    <B>Retest is not the only method of refuting intoxilyzer
    results.</B>Where undisputed testimony showed the machine
    consistently read .005% too high, and the margin by which
    driver allegedly exceeded the statutory limit was only .003%,
    the department's prima facie case was nullified, and retest
    could serve no valid purpose. Scherr v. Dept. of Rev., 49 P.3d
    1217 (Colo. App. 2002).</P>
    <P>
    <B>Revocation of a driver's license under the "per se" statute
    requires a properly supported finding that the licensee was
    driving,</B>not a finding that the officer who requested that
    the licensee submit to a blood alcohol test had reasonable
    grounds to believe that the licensee was operating a motor
    vehicle while under the influence of, or impaired by, alcohol.
    Charnes v. Lobato, 743 P.2d 27 (Colo. 1987).</P>
    <P>
    <B>The term "drove a vehicle",</B>for the purposes of
    subsection (1)(a)(I), means a person has actual physical
    control of a motor vehicle upon a highway. Brewer v. Motor
    Vehicle Div., Dept. of Rev., 720 P.2d 564 (Colo. 1986); Smith
    v. Charnes, 728 P.2d 1287 (Colo. 1986); Nefzger v. Dept. of
    Rev., 739 P.2d 224 (Colo. 1987); Hancock v. State Dept. of
    Rev., 758 P.2d 1372 (Colo. 1988).</P>
    <P>"Actual physical control" does not require that the vehicle
    be moving on its own power or that the vehicle travel a
    particular distance. Therefore, licensee was in actual physical
    control of the vehicle when he was seated behind the wheel,
    with the engine running and the car in gear, as the vehicle was
    towed out of a snowbank. Colo. Div. of Rev. v. Lounsbury, 743
    P.2d 23 (Colo. 1987).</P>
    <P>
    <B>Person who was in the driver's seat of an automobile which
    had its motor running and its parking lights on</B>and which
    was located in a private lot was in actual physical control of
    the automobile and thus was driving a motor vehicle. Therefore,
    refusal to consent to testing violates "express consent"
    statute and justifies revocation of license under this section.
    Motor Vehicle Div. v. Warman, 763 P.2d 558 (Colo. 1988).</P>
    <P>
    <B>Specific criminal charge is not required</B>for a valid
    administrative license revocation. Irey v. Nielson, 716 P.2d
    486 (Colo. App. 1986).</P>
    <P>The department's determination of the facts with respect to
    administrative revocation is independent of the determination
    of the same or similar facts in the adjudication of any
    criminal charges arising out of the same occurrence. When the
    statutory text evidences a legislative intent to treat
    separately the administrative and criminal consequences of
    driving under the influence of intoxicating liquor, the statute
    should be interpreted in the manner that gives effect to the
    entire legislative scheme. Nefzger v. Dept. of Rev., 739 P.2d
    224 (Colo. 1987).</P>
    <P>
    <B>Issue preclusion does not bar revocation despite different
    outcome in criminal case.</B>In a revocation proceeding, the
    department of revenue may make findings "independent of the
    determination of the same or similar facts in the adjudication
    of any criminal charges arising out of the same occurrence".
    Accordingly, given the substantial differences in the purposes
    and procedures in a revocation hearing and a criminal case,
    issue preclusion does not prevent the independent resolution of
    the same issue in each proceeding. Meyer v. Dept. of Rev., 143
    P.3d 1181 (Colo. App. 2006) (decided prior to 2008 repeal and
    reenactment).</P>
    <P>
    <B>Hearsay evidence alone may be used to establish an element
    at a revocation hearing</B>if such evidence is sufficiently
    reliable and trustworthy, and the evidence possesses probative
    value commonly accepted by reasonable and prudent persons in
    the conduct of their affairs. Colo. Dept. of Rev. v. Kirke, 743
    P.2d 16 (Colo. 1987); Colo. Div. of Rev. v. Lounsbury, 743 P.2d

    <P>
    <B>Burden of proof.</B>At a driver's license revocation
    hearing, the state must establish by a preponderance of the
    evidence that the licensee drove a vehicle with an alcohol
    concentration of 0.15 or more grams of alcohol per 210 liters
    of breath. Schocke v. St. Dept. of Rev., 719 P.2d 361 (Colo.
    App. 1986).</P>
    <P>State did not meet burden with regard to driver's breath
    alcohol concentration where two different tests, each conducted
    by a certified operator on a certified machine which had been
    verified as operating properly prior to the test, gave
    different results as to whether the driver exceeded acceptable
    breath alcohol concentration level. Schocke v. St. Dept. of
    Rev., 719 P.2d 361 (Colo. App. 1986).</P>
    <P>State did not meet its burden of proof where undisputed
    testimony showed the machine used to test driver's breath
    consistently read .005% too high, and the margin by which
    driver allegedly exceeded the statutory limit was only .003%.

    <P>
    <B>Revocation of driver's license is not reversible upon review
    based upon nonjurisdictional statutory violation</B>unless
    substantial rights of licensee have been prejudiced. Alford v.
    Tipton, 822 P.2d 513 (Colo. App. 1991).</P>
    <P>
    <B>A field test on a portable breath testing device</B>given to
    the suspect prior to arrest did not constitute a chemical test
    within the meaning of the express consent statute, and so a
    revocation for refusal to submit to additional testing is
    supported. Davis v. Carroll, 782 P.2d 884 (Colo. App.
    1989).</P>
    <P>
    <B>Chemical test for alcohol relied upon for revocation of
    license</B>requested more than one hour after the alleged
    driving offense but within a reasonable time of that offense
    will support the revocation of a driver's license for refusal
    to submit to the test. Charnes v. Boom, 766 P.2d 665 (Colo.
    1988).</P>
    <P>"Within one hour thereafter" means up to and including the

    Davis v. Charnes, 740 P.2d 534 (Colo. App. 1987).</P>
    <P>
    <B>Hearing officer cannot refuse to accept into evidence the

    <P>
    <B>Subsections (1)(a) and (8)(c) indicate legislative
    intent</B>that license revocation be based on the results of
    the chemical analysis at least to the extent that the test can
    be considered prima facie proof that blood alcohol
    concentration was in excess of the statutory standard. Swain v.
    State Dept. of Rev., 717 P.2d 507 (Colo. App. 1985).</P>
    <P>
    <B>Subsections (1)(a)(I) and (8)(c) are not

    concentration obtained pursuant to subsection (8)(c) was
    sufficient to sustain revocation of driver's license. Harvey v.
    Charnes, 728 P.2d 373 (Colo. App. 1986) (decided prior to 1987
    amendments to subsections (1)(a) and (8)(c)).</P>
    <P>
    <B>Margin of error may be considered</B>in determining weight
    accorded to blood alcohol test, but hearing officer did not
    abuse discretion in finding blood alcohol in excess of
    statutory standard where there was no showing that the machine
    was inaccurate. Swain v. State Dept. of Rev., 717 P.2d 507
    (Colo. App. 1985).</P>
    <P>Hearing officer did not act arbitrarily or capriciously in
    revoking defendant's license upon finding that he had blood
    alcohol content of .159, despite contention that there was a
    margin of error in the test so that blood alcohol content could
    have been less than .15. Nefzger v. Dept. of Rev., 739 P.2d 224

    <P>
    <B>Presumption in subsection (8)(e)(II) does not apply to
    determination of whether a person is a "persistent drunk
    driver",</B>as that term is defined in ยง 42-1-102. Presumption
    that favors the accuracy of a blood alcohol content analysis
    done on behalf of a law enforcement agency when a driver
    submits conflicting test results applies only to revocation
    determinations. Garcia v. Huber, 252 P.3d 486 (Colo. App.
    2010).</P>
    <P>
    <B>"Verified report" is not necessarily a notarized
    report.</B>The department of revenue had jurisdiction to revoke
    commercial driver's license for one year where police officer's
    report contained all necessary information, was sworn to under
    penalty of perjury, and used form supplied by department. Dept.
    of Rev. v. Hibbs, 122 P.3d 999 (Colo. 2005) (decided under this
    section as it existed prior to 2005 amendment).</P>
    <P>
    <B>A blood alcohol content test report does not have to comply
    with affidavit requirements.</B>Subsection (8)(c) requires
    affidavits to be dated, signed, and sworn under penalty of
    perjury, but the BAC report is not an affidavit. Subsection
    (8)(c)'s requirements are triggered only when someone other
    than a police officer or the respondent submits an affidavit.
    This interpretation is in harmony with the rest of the statute
    and is consistent with ยง 22-4-105 of the State Administrative
    Procedure Act (APA). Dept. of Rev. v. Rowland, 2018 CO 1, 408

    <P>
    <B>The two-hour standard in ยง 42-4-1301.1 does not apply to a
    refusal to take a test.</B>The refusal to take a blood alcohol
    test is an independent cause for revoking driver's license.
    Therefore, so long as the request is within a reasonable time,
    a refusal to take the test may result in loss of a driver's
    license. Stumpf v. Colo. Dept. of Rev., 231 P.3d 1 (Colo. App.
    2009).</P>
    <P>
    <B>Arresting officer's failure to serve driver
    personally</B>with notice of revocation of his driver's license
    does not affect department of revenue's jurisdiction to serve
    the driver with such notice and to enter revocation order.

    Dept. of Rev., 739 P.2d 908 (Colo. App. 1987).</P>
    <P>
    <B>Driver could not be deemed to have received notice of
    revocation</B>of his license where mailed notice was returned
    by postal authorities as unclaimed; return was evidence of fact
    that notice was not served, rebutting presumption indicated in
    subsection (3)(b) that service of notice would be effective
    three days after mailing. Potter v. Dept. of Rev., 739 P.2d 908
    (Colo. App. 1987).</P>
    <P>After mailed notice of revocation was returned by postal
    authorities as unclaimed, driver's written request for hearing,
    together with affidavit setting forth reasons for late filing
    of request, were sufficient. Potter v. Dept. of Rev., 739 P.2d
    908 (Colo. App. 1987).</P>
    <P>
    <B>Waiver of notice.</B>Although motorist did not make an
    express waiver, the fact that he and his attorney appeared and
    argued the merits of his driver's license revocation but did
    not object to the timeliness of notice demonstrated his
    willingness to forego receipt of timely notice and constituted
    a waiver. Mattingly v. Charnes, 700 P.2d 927 (Colo. App. 1985);
    Hendrickson v. State Dept. of Rev., M.V.D., 716 P.2d 489 (Colo.
    App. 1986).</P>
    <P>
    <B>Since the motorist failed to surrender his driver's license
    as required by this section, such refusal gave the department
    of revenue grounds to deny his request for a revocation
    hearing.</B>Haynes v. Charnes, 772 P.2d 670 (Colo. App.

    plaintiff pursuant to either of the prescribed statutory
    methods.</B>Knaus v. Dept. of Rev., 844 P.2d 1318 (Colo. App.
    1992).</P>
    <P>
    <B>Plaintiff not entitled to be given credit toward three-month
    revocation period for period he was under mistaken belief that
    his license had been revoked.</B>He had not yet received notice
    of the revocation as required by statute, and the
    misunderstanding was not the fault or responsibility of the
    department. Knaus v. Dept. of Rev., 844 P.2d 1318 (Colo. App.
    1992).</P>
    <P>
    <B>The 60-day time limit of subsection (8) is

    <P>
    <B>Sixty-day period for a license revocation hearing begins to
    run at the time the department receives the written
    request.</B>Ellis v. Charnes, 722 P.2d 436 (Colo. App.
    1986).</P>
    <P>
    <B>If the sixtieth day falls on a Saturday, Sunday, or legal
    holiday,</B>the 60-day period is automatically extended to the
    end of the next business day. Perez v. Dept. of Rev., 778 P.2d
    326 (Colo. App. 1989).</P>
    <P>
    <B>The date of filing of request for a hearing is not
    included</B>for purposes of computing the 60-day period. Perez
    v. Dept. of Rev., 778 P.2d 326 (Colo. App. 1989).</P>
    <P>
    <B>Revocation hearing must not only be scheduled but held
    within 60 days.</B>The time limit is jurisdictional and the
    department's failure to hold the hearing requires dismissal of
    the action against plaintiff. Wilson v. Hill, 782 P.2d 874
    (Colo. App. 1989) (decided under law in effect prior to 1989
    amendment).</P>
    <P>
    <B>In a license revocation proceeding, the department has the
    burden to prove that it met the earliest possible time
    requirement in order to retain jurisdiction to revoke a
    license.</B>The power of administrative agencies extends only
    so far as the authority conferred on them by statute. Emmons v.
    Dept. of Rev., 2020 COA 17, 459 P.3d 784.</P>
    <P>
    <B>Unlike the time limit for hearings under ยง 42-2-122.1
    (7)(e), the 60-day time limit in ยง 42-2-123 (12) is not
    mandatory.</B>DiMarco v. Dept. of Rev., 857 P.2d 1349 (Colo.
    App. 1993) (decided under law in effect prior to the 1994
    amendment).</P>
    <P>
    <B>Subsection (7)(c) provides the exclusive grounds on which an
    untimely request for a license revocation hearing may be
    granted.</B>Baulsir v. Dept. of Rev., 702 P.2d 277 (Colo. App.
    1985); Kelley v. Dept. of Rev., 780 P.2d 67 (Colo. App.
    1989).</P>
    <P>When the grounds for an untimely request for a license
    revocation hearing is attorney negligence in failing to request
    a hearing within the statutorily designated time period, the
    trial court erred in ordering the department to grant the
    request. Baulsir v. Dept. of Rev., 702 P.2d 277 (Colo. App.
    1985).</P>
    <P>Due process clause was not violated since adequate advance
    notice and an opportunity for an appropriate hearing before the
    license revocation became effective was given. Baulsir v. Dept.
    of Rev., 702 P.2d 277 (Colo. App. 1985).</P>
    <P>
    <B>Statutory notice provisions require driver to request
    hearing within seven days of time notice is deemed by statute
    to be received,</B>not from time of actual notice. Kelley v.
    Dept. of Rev., 780 P.2d 67 (Colo. App. 1989).</P>
    <P>
    <B>Written notice of right to subpoena law enforcement officer
    is jurisdictional requirement.</B>Where respondent never
    received such notice and department nevertheless held
    revocation hearing in absence of officer over respondent's
    objection, order of revocation was invalid. Kress v. Dept. of
    Rev., 834 P.2d 268 (Colo. App. 1992).</P>
    <P>
    <B>If respondent requests that the law enforcement officer be
    present, the officer cannot fulfill this statutory requirement
    by appearing via two-way video conference.</B>The term
    "presence" requires actual presence not video presence. Barnes
    v. Colo. Dept. of Rev., 23 P.3d 1235 (Colo. App. 2000).</P>
    <P>
    <B>Department's policy of never granting a rescheduling request
    by a licensee or counsel for an alternative date within the
    60-day limit is arbitrary, capricious, and inconsistent with
    the statutory obligation to provide a meaningful opportunity
    for a fair hearing.</B>Such policy effectively violated
    licensee's right to counsel of her own choosing when counsel
    made the request due to a scheduling conflict. However, the
    department is not required to accommodate every request for
    rescheduling; it must take the circumstances surrounding the
    request into consideration. Erbe v. Colo. Dept. of Rev., 51
    P.3d 1096 (Colo. App. 2002).</P>
    <P>
    <B>Subsection (9)(c) provides the grounds for reversing a DMV
    revocation order.</B>Where analysis of licensee's blood alcohol
    content was conflicting, it was the hearing officer's role, not
    the role of the reviewing court, to determine which test result
    was more reliable and deserved greater weight. Therefore, the
    hearing officer's decision to rely on one of two conflicting
    test results did not constitute grounds for reversal under the
    statute. Charnes v. Lobato, 743 P.2d 27 (Colo. 1987).</P>
    <P>
    <B>The presumption of accuracy described in subsection
    (9)(c)(II) applies only to revocation hearings and not to
    "persistent drunk driver" determinations.</B>Given the clear
    statutory language, it is apparent that the general assembly
    intended the presumption of accuracy in blood alcohol content
    to apply to the limit required for license revocation.
    Conversely, there is no indication that it intended the
    presumption of accuracy in blood alcohol content to apply to
    the "persistent drunk driver" section of the statute. Wiesner
    v. Huber, 228 P.3d 973 (Colo. App. 2010) (decided under law in
    effect prior to 2008 amendment).</P>
    <P>
    <B>Statute vests authority to review administrative revocations
    exclusively in district court</B>in county of driver's
    residence, and a petition filed by a nonresident of the county
    must be dismissed. Dept. of Rev. v. Borquez, 751 P.2d 639
    (Colo. 1988).</P>
    <P>
    <B>Absence of transcript.</B>Under this section the record does
    not include the transcript. Destruction of transcript due to
    administrative practice, standing alone, does not require
    reversal of department's decision. Cop v. Charnes, 738 P.2d
    1200 (Colo. App. 1987).</P>
    <P>Nor does absence of transcript due to accidental erasure of
    the tape, standing alone, require reversal of the department's
    decision. Guynn v. Dept. of Rev., 939 P.2d 526 (Colo. App.
    1997).</P>
    <P>
    <B>The hearing officer is the trier of fact.</B>Determinations
    concerning witness credibility, evidentiary weight, and the
    resolution of any evidentiary conflicts are factual matters
    solely within the province of the hearing officer as the trier
    of fact. Haney v. Colo. Dept. of Rev., 2015 COA 125, 361 P.3d
    1093.</P>
    <P>
    <B>A reviewing court may not disturb a hearing officer's
    factual findings unless the findings are "clearly erroneous on
    the whole record".</B>Neppl v. Dept. of Rev., 2019 COA 29, 439
    P.3d 76.</P>
    <P>
    <B>District court erred in substituting its judgment for
    hearing officer's determination as to plaintiff's unjustified
    refusal to submit to testing</B>when hearing officer's finding
    was based upon resolution of conflicting evidence. Alford v.
    Tipton, 822 P.2d 513 (Colo. App. 1991).</P>
    <P>
    <B>Department of revenue is not bound in administrative
    revocation under the collateral estoppel doctrine by the
    resolution of the same issues in criminal proceedings arising
    out of the same occurrence.</B>Wallace v. Dept. of Rev., 787 P.
    2d 181 (Colo. App. 1989).</P>
    <P>
    <B>A request for extraordinary relief in the form of mandamus
    under C.R.C.P. 106 was improper to challenge arbitrary action
    by the department of revenue</B>in revoking a person's driver's
    license, even though petition was filed on the basis that the
    department refused to conduct a revocation hearing. The APA
    provides the proper mechanism for seeking relief based on
    arbitrary action by an executive agency. Dept. of Rev. v.
    District Court, 802 P.2d 473 (Colo. 1990).</P>
    <P>
    <B>Questions as to legality of initial motor vehicle stop and

    <P>
    <B>The department's authority is limited by pertinent statutory
    provisions in a driver's license revocation proceeding</B>and,
    absent any statutory authorization for a "reopening", the
    asserted right thereto was a nullity and plaintiff was not
    required to "exhaust" such an invalid administrative "remedy"
    as a condition precedent to his statutory right to seek
    judicial review of the department's final order of revocation.
    Foos v. State, 888 P.2d 321 (Colo. App. 1994).</P>
    <P>
    <B>Under the applicable statutory scheme, the final agency
    action of the department that is subject to judicial review in
    express consent revocation proceedings</B>is the issuance of
    the final order of revocation by the hearing officer at the
    conclusion of the revocation hearing. Foos v. State, 888 P.2d
    321 (Colo. App. 1994).</P>
    <P>
    <B>Judicial review is only available from a final agency
    determination.</B>District court lacks jurisdiction to
    interfere with agency's setting of hearing date. State Dept. of
    Rev. v. District Court, 908 P.2d 518 (Colo. 1995).</P>
    <P>
    <B>On remand, the district court's disposition of the judicial
    review proceedings</B>must be governed solely by the standards
    of the applicable provisions of this section and the APA. Foos
    v. State, 888 P.2d 321 (Colo. App. 1994).</P>
    <P>
    <B>Court has no subject matter jurisdiction to review the
    suspension or revocation of a driver's license</B>when the
    driver-defendant has failed to exhaust his administrative
    remedies before seeking judicial review. Kriz v. Colo. Dept. of
    Rev., 916 P.2d 659 (Colo. App. 1996).</P>
    <P>
    <B>Failure to file a petition for judicial review within 30
    days after issuance of a revocation order is a jurisdictional
    defect that mandates dismissal of the action</B>where, as here,
    the statute does not mandate the filing of a petition for
    reconsideration; therefore, it was error for the district court
    to affirm the revocation order. Jeffries v. Fisher, 66 P.3d 218
    (Colo. App. 2003).</P>
    <P>
    <B>Remedy for driver who has had his driver's license revoked
    or suspended may be available pursuant to ยง 24-4-105(10) where
    the Colorado department of revenue does not hold an
    administrative hearing prior to the expiration of 60 days</B>as
    the department is under statutory obligation to hold an
    administrative hearing within 60 days under either this section
    or ยง 42-2-125. Kriz v. Colo. Dept. of Rev., 916 P.2d 659 (Colo.

    1993).</P>
    <P>
    <B>The statutory grounds for delay of the license revocation
    hearing must be strictly construed.</B>The exception that
    arises when a police officer is unavailable must be limited to
    situations involving the same degree of urgency as covered by
    the other enumerated exceptions. A bare notation that the
    officer had to teach school is insufficient to establish the
    applicability of the statutory exception. Rule v. Dept. of
    Rev., 868 P.2d 1166 (Colo. App. 1994).</P>
    <P>
    <B>Officer who submitted the documentation for a DUI arrest was

    <P>
    <B>Reversal of a driver's license revocation</B>is warranted

  <N></N>(a)
  <M>Except as provided in paragraph (b) of subsection (8) of this
  section, the department has the authority to suspend the license
  of any driver who, in accordance with the schedule of points set
  forth in this section, has been convicted of traffic violations
  resulting in the accumulation of twelve points or more within any
  twelve consecutive months or eighteen points or more within any
  twenty-four consecutive months, or, in the case of a minor driver
  eighteen years of age or older, who has accumulated nine points
  or more within any twelve consecutive months, or twelve points or
  more within any twenty-four consecutive months, or fourteen
  points or more for violations occurring after reaching the age of
  eighteen years, or, in the case of a minor driver under the age
  of eighteen years, who has accumulated more than five points
  within any twelve consecutive months or more than six points for
  violations occurring prior to reaching the age of eighteen years;
  except that the accumulation of points causing the subjection to
  suspension of the license of a chauffeur who, in the course of
  employment, has as a principal duty the operation of a motor
  vehicle shall be sixteen points in one year, twenty-four points
  in two years, or twenty-eight points in four years, if all the
  points are accumulated while said chauffeur is in the course of
  employment. Any provision of this section to the contrary
  notwithstanding, the license of a chauffeur who is convicted of
  DUI, DUI per se, DWAI, UDD, or leaving the scene of an accident
  shall be suspended in the same manner as if the offense occurred
  outside the course of employment. Whenever a minor driver under
  the age of eighteen years receives a summons for a traffic
  violation, the minor's parent or legal guardian or, if the minor
  is without parents or guardian, the person who signed the minor
  driver's application for a license shall immediately be notified
  by the court from which the summons was issued.</M>
  <P N="(1)(b)">(b)
  <M>If any applicant for a license to operate a motor vehicle has
  illegally operated a motor vehicle in this state prior to the

  application, the department has the authority to deny the
  issuance of said license for not more than twelve months.</M></P>
  <P N="(1)(c)">(c)
  <M>For the purpose of this section, any points accumulated by a
  minor under an instruction permit shall apply to the minor
  driver's license subsequently issued to or applied for by such
  minor.</M></P>
  <P N="(1)(d)">(d)
  <M>No suspension or denial shall be made until a hearing has been
  held or the driver has failed to appear for a hearing scheduled
  in accordance with this section. This section shall not be

  <M>The accumulation of points within the time periods provided in

  a current or previous license restraint with a determined
  reinstatement date for the same offense or conviction that caused
  the driver to accumulate sufficient points to warrant suspension,
  the department may not order a point suspension of the license of
  the driver unless the license or driving privilege of the driver

  <M>If the department does not order a point suspension against
  the license of a driver because of the existence of a current or
  previous license restraint with a determined reinstatement date
  under the provisions of subparagraph (I) of this paragraph (b),
  the department shall utilize the points that were assessed
  against the driver in determining whether to impose any future
  license suspension if the driver accumulates any more points
  against the driver's license.</M></P>

  <M>Suspension hearings when ordered by the department shall be
  held at the district office of the department closest to the
  residence of the licensee; except that all or part of the hearing
  may, at the discretion of the department, be conducted in real
  time, by telephone or other electronic means in accordance with
  section 42-1-218.5. A hearing delay shall be granted by the
  department only if the licensee presents the department with good
  cause for such delay. Good cause shall include absence from the
  state or county of residence, personal illness, or any other
  circumstance which, in the department's discretion, constitutes
  sufficient reason for delay. In the event that a suspension
  hearing is delayed, the department shall set a new date for such
  hearing no later than sixty days after the date of the original
  hearing.</M></P>
  <P N="(11)">(11)
  <M>Upon such hearing, the department or its authorized agent may

  require a reexamination of the licensee.</M></P>
  <P N="(12)">(12)
  <M>If at the hearing held pursuant to subsection (8) of this
  section it appears that the record of the driver sustains
  suspension as provided in this section, the department shall
  immediately suspend such driver's license, and such license shall
  then be surrendered to the department. If at such hearing it
  appears that the record of the driver does not sustain
  suspension, the department shall not suspend such license and
  shall adjust the accumulated-point total accordingly. In the
  event that the driver's license is suspended, the department may
  issue a probationary license for a period not to exceed the
  period of suspension, which license may contain such restrictions
  as the department deems reasonable and necessary and which may
  thereafter be subject to cancellation as a result of any
  violation of the restrictions imposed therein. The department may
  also order any driver whose license is suspended to take a
  complete driving reexamination. After such hearing, the licensee
  may appeal the decision to the district court as provided in
  section 42-2-135.</M></P>
  <P N="(13)">(13)
  <M>If the driver fails to appear at such hearing after proper
  notification as provided in subsections (7) and (8) of this
  section and a delay or continuance has not been requested and
  granted as provided in subsection (10) of this section, the
  department shall immediately suspend the license of the driver. A

  the request shall not postpone the effectiveness of the
  restraint.</M></P>

    by SB 94-1 and to repealed ยง 13-4-23, C.R.S. 1963, and to ยง

    have been included in the annotations to this section.</P>
    <P>
    <B>Portion of section authorizing suspension of license held
    constitutional.</B>Portion of this section which grants the
    motor vehicle division authority to suspend the driver's
    license of any operator who has accumulated "twelve points
    within any twelve consecutive months, or eighteen points within
    any twenty-four consecutive months" is not overbroad, vague, or
    indefinite. Zaba v. Motor Vehicle Div., 183 Colo. 335, 516 P.2d
    634 (1973).</P>
    <P>
    <B>Portion of section severable.</B>The portion of this section
    dealing with suspension of licenses is complete in itself and
    independent of the portion of the statute dealing with
    probationary licenses; the two provisions are severable.
    Elizondo v. State, Dept. of Rev., 194 Colo. 113, 570 P.2d 518
    (1977).</P>
    <P>
    <B>Classification of 18- to 21-year-olds not violative of equal
    protection.</B>Where licensees assert that they have been
    denied the equal protection of the laws in violation of the
    fourteenth amendment because Colorado allows drivers in the age
    group of 18 to 21 years to accumulate only eight points prior
    to suspension, while drivers over 21 years are allowed 12
    points before their licenses are suspended, and further assert
    that there is no reasonable relationship to the public health,
    safety, and welfare of Colorado in the different treatment,
    statistical analyses of all accidents in Colorado in 1973,
    analyzed by age, fully justifies the different treatment
    mandated by the general assembly, and these figures clearly
    support the determination by the general assembly that drivers
    in the lower age groups demand closer supervision, to protect
    the public health and safety. Lopez v. Motor Vehicle Div., 189
    Colo. 133, 538 P.2d 446 (1975).</P>
    <P>
    <B>Nonresident licensees assert that it is unreasonable for
    Colorado to treat them differently from their states of
    residence</B>where they are allowed the same driving privileges
    as older drivers, but, as repeatedly pointed out, the use of
    Colorado highways is a privilege strictly governed by statute,
    and it has not been demonstrated that the general assembly was
    in any way unreasonable or arbitrary in its classification.

    <B>Higher point allocation for chauffeurs not
    unconstitutional.</B>The legislative decision to accord
    chauffeurs as a class a higher point allocation than that given
    to the "regular driver" cannot be viewed as so lacking a
    reasonable basis in fact as to render the statutory
    classification constitutionally flawed. Smith v. Charnes, 649
    P.2d 1089 (Colo. 1982).</P>
    <P>
    <B>Statutes enacted by the general assembly in the exercise of
    its police power must be strictly construed</B>and are not to
    be extended by implication; accordingly, an operator's license,
    once issued, is not to be revoked arbitrarily but only in the
    manner provided by law. Cave v. Colo. Dept. of Rev., 31 Colo.
    App. 185, 501 P.2d 479 (1972).</P>
    <P>
    <B>Revocation proceeding is civil.</B>The administrative
    proceeding to revoke the driver's license of a habitual
    offender is a civil proceeding. State v. Laughlin, 634 P.2d 49
    (Colo. 1981).</P>
    <P>
    <B>This section does not constitute an unreasonable exercise of
    the police power,</B>since an individual's right to use the
    highways of the state is an adjunct of the constitutional right
    to acquire, possess, and protect property. Zaba v. Motor
    Vehicle Div., 183 Colo. 335, 516 P.2d 634 (1973).</P>
    <P>
    <B>This section does not unconstitutionally delegate
    legislative power.</B>Since the overall statutory scheme, of
    which the probationary license provision is a part, provides
    sufficient general standards to guide its application and
    contains adequate safeguards against administrative abuse, this
    section is not on its face an unconstitutional delegation of
    legislative power. Elizondo v. State, Dept. of Rev., 194 Colo.

    <P>

    <P>The primary purpose of this section and sections ยงยง 42-2-121
    and 42-2-122 is to protect the public safety upon the highways.
    Heil v. Charnes, 44 Colo. App. 225, 616 P.2d 980 (1980).</P>
    <P>This section is designed to protect the welfare and safety
    of the public and must be construed to further that legislative
    purpose. Livengood v. Dept. of Rev., 44 Colo. App. 431, 614
    P.2d 908 (1980).</P>
    <P>
    <B>Legislative intent.</B>Legislative history clearly
    demonstrates that it was the intent of the general assembly to
    authorize the motor vehicle division to consider that period of
    time ending with the date of the last violation involved. Zaba
    v. Motor Vehicle Div., 183 Colo. 335, 516 P.2d 634 (1973);
    Perlmutter v. State, Dept. of Rev., 191 Colo. 517, 554 P.2d 691
    (1976).</P>
    <P>The general assembly did not intend by this section to
    empower the motor vehicle division to delve back into the
    driving history of any operator for the purpose of suspending
    his license. Zaba v. Motor Vehicle Div., 183 Colo. 335, 516
    P.2d 634 (1973).</P>
    <P>The legislative intent was to authorize two suspensions in
    an instance where during the first year the driver accumulated
    12 points and in the second year the driver accumulated 6 more
    points. Perlmutter v. State, Dept. of Rev., 191 Colo. 517, 554
    P.2d 691 (1976).</P>
    <P>
    <B>Suspension of license authorized upon accumulation of 12
    points in one year.</B>Subsection (1) authorizes the department
    of revenue to suspend the license of any operator who has been
    convicted of traffic violations resulting in accumulation of 12
    points in one year. Theobald v. District Court, 148 Colo. 466,
    366 P.2d 563 (1961); Markham v. Theobald, 152 Colo. 540, 383
    P.2d 791 (1963).</P>
    <P>
    <B>The word "year" must be interpreted as a year tied to the
    expiration date of the license,</B>this being referred to as an
    "anniversary license year". Markham v. Theobald, 152 Colo. 540,
    383 P.2d 791 (1963).</P>
    <P>
    <B>Suspension of license authorized.</B>This section
    establishes a basic rule that any operator or chauffeur is
    subject to license suspension if he is convicted of traffic
    violations which result in the accumulation of 12 points within
    any 12 consecutive months. Edwards v. Motor Vehicle Div., 33
    Colo. App. 382, 520 P.2d 598 (1974).</P>
    <P>
    <B>Section contains a limited exception for chauffeurs</B>which
    allows them to accumulate a maximum of 16 points in one year
    subject, however, to the proviso that "all such points are
    accumulated while said chauffeur is in the course of his
    employment". Edwards v. Motor Vehicle Div., 33 Colo. App. 382,
    520 P.2d 598 (1974).</P>
    <P>
    <B>Where all of the violations and the resulting points did not
    occur within the course of chauffeur's employment,</B>the
    16-point exception is not applicable. Edwards v. Motor Vehicle
    Div., 33 Colo. App. 382, 520 P.2d 598 (1974).</P>
    <P>
    <B>Thus, suspension of license not subject to abuse of
    discretion.</B>Where evidence is clear and demonstrates that
    chauffeur has more than enough points to justify suspension of
    license, suspension of license is ministerial act, discharge of
    which is not subject to abuse of discretion. Michels v. Motor
    Vehicle Div. of Dept. of Rev., 32 Colo. App. 106, 506 P.2d 1243
    (1973); Mitchell v. Charnes, 656 P.2d 719 (Colo. App.
    1982).</P>
    <P>The suspension of drivers' licenses, being based on a point
    system, involves no discretion on the part of an administrator
    and therefore is not subject to abuse of discretion. Elizondo
    v. State, Dept. of Rev., 194 Colo. 113, 570 P.2d 518
    (1977).</P>
    <P>
    <B>Suspension of license based upon the point system is not
    subject to abuse of discretion.</B>Ryan v. Charnes, 738 P.2d
    1175 (Colo. 1987).</P>
    <P>
    <B>The department is authorized to suspend the driver's license
    of any person who has been "convicted" of traffic violations
    resulting in the accumulation of excessive points,</B>but
    points cannot be assessed until after "conviction" for such
    traffic violations. Jackson v. Dept. of Rev., 791 P.2d 1206
    (Colo. App. 1990).</P>
    <P>
    <B>Department is vested with discretionary authority</B>to
    determine length of period of suspension and whether to grant a
    probationary license. Elkins v. Charnes, 682 P.2d 70 (Colo.
    App. 1984).</P>
    <P>
    <B>No violation of due process.</B>Section 42-4-1510 and this

    <B>Minimum standard mandated for use of penalty assessment as

    may be used as a conviction for purposes of suspension or

    that offense. Stortz v. Colo. Dept. of Rev., 195 Colo. 325, 578
    P.2d 229 (1978).</P>
    <P>
    <B>Summons need not reflect assessable points.</B>Where a
    conviction is the result of a court appearance, not of a
    penalty assessment, the summons need not reflect the number of
    points to be assessed for the offense charged; the statutory
    provision which requires that a summons reflect the number of
    points relates only to penalty assessments under ยง

    <B>Due process requirements.</B>Due process requires that the
    department of revenue promulgate rules or regulations to guide
    hearing officers in their decisions regarding requests for
    probationary licenses. These rules and regulations must be
    sufficiently specific to inform the public what factors will be

    person whose license was suspended as a result of a criminal
    conviction in accordance with this section could receive a
    probationary license, because the court, after making a
    determination of whether persons allegedly subject to disparate
    treatment by these sections were in fact similarly situated,
    found that no classification of persons similarly situated
    exists since ยง 42-2-122.1 involved an administrative suspension

    <P>
    <B>Hearing officer must ensure record indicates existence of

    nevertheless, pursuant to his statutory authority under
    subsection (1)(a), ensure that the record on its face indicates
    the existence of the requisite convictions. Gurule v. State

    <P>
    <B>Licensee may challenge mistakes in records but not

    not relitigate the issue of guilt as to the offenses shown on
    his record. State v. Laughlin, 634 P.2d 49 (Colo. 1981).</P>

    <B>Proof of payment of money did not prove conviction.</B>Where
    plaintiff's driving privileges were suspended because she had
    allegedly accumulated 12 points against her driving record
    within a 12-month period, but of these points, four were based
    on an alleged conviction of a charge of driving 41 miles per
    hour in a 30 mile per hour zone in the city of Golden, a
    four-point offense, and with respect to this charge, the record
    indicated only that $15 was paid on September 26, 1974, to the
    Golden municipal court clerk, proof of payment of $15, even if
    it were assumed that it had been to pay a fine, did not prove
    that there was a conviction of the offense for which plaintiff

    <P>
    <B>The general assembly decriminalized various state law

    <P>
    <B>A default judgment entered by a municipal court for a civil
    traffic infraction under municipal law does not constitute a
    "conviction" for purposes of assessing points and authorizing a
    license suspension.</B>The clause "or under the similar
    provisions of any town or city ordinance," which follows the
    provisions regarding penalty assessments under state law in
    subsection (6)(a), does not follow the provisions added in 1982
    regarding judgments for civil traffic infractions under state
    law. It cannot be presumed that this omission was unintentional
    or without significance. Jackson v. Dept. of Rev., 791 P.2d

    <P>
    <B>Proof of knowledge of revocation order.</B>The prosecution
    is required to prove the element of knowledge of the revocation
    order in a driving after judgment prohibited case, as mailing
    notice of the order is only prima facie proof of its receipt
    under subsection (12), and is not conclusive. People v. Lesh,
    668 P.2d 1362 (Colo. 1983).</P>
    <P>
    <B>The 60-day time limit under subsection (12) is, on its face,

    <P>
    <B>Construing the pertinent time limitation to be mandatory
    would divest the Department of jurisdiction to suspend or
    revoke any license</B>if that limitation were violated, even if
    no prejudice was occasioned by such violation and, absent
    explicit language revealing such, we decline to assume that the

    should defeat the prime objective of the statute. DiMarco v.

    <P>
    <B>Unlike the time limit for hearings under ยง 42-2-122.1
    (7)(e), the 60-day time limit in ยง 42-2-123 (12) is not
    mandatory</B>and, consequently, if no claim of actual prejudice
    resulting from the delay is established, the department does
    not lose jurisdiction over the habitual offender revocation
    proceedings or the points suspension proceedings simply because

    <B>Probationary license must be issued unless department makes
    finding of unfitness.</B>Where the department makes no finding
    that the applicant for a probationary license is "unsafe for
    driving for any purpose", and the basis for the suspension is,
    at least in part, an alcohol-related offense, subsection (13)
    requires the department to grant the probationary license. In

    <P>
    <B>Subsection (13) inapplicable to plea-bargained

    that he is entitled to the protection of subsection (13)(a),
    when seeking a probationary license. Schmidt v. Colo. Dept. of

    <P>
    <B>In determining whether motorist's license should be
    suspended,</B>the length of that suspension, and whether a
    probationary license should be granted, the department of
    revenue did not err in considering both the municipal court
    conviction and the traffic points resulting therefrom. Fuller

    <P>
    <B>Applicant's need for probationary license is one
    factor.</B>The need of an applicant for a probationary license
    during a period of suspension is only one factor to be
    considered by the hearing officer, and it was not error for
    hearing officer to deny a probationary license based on
    applicant's repeated driving convictions. Fisher v. Jorgensen,
    674 P.2d 1003 (Colo. App. 1983).</P>
    <P>
    <B>The benefits of amendatory legislation do not apply to
    driver's license revocation proceedings</B>because revocation
    of a driver's license is a civil, not criminal, matter.
    Dellovade v. Charnes, 633 P.2d 531 (Colo. App. 1981).</P>
    <P>The general rule in civil proceedings regarding amendatory
    legislation is that civil liability already incurred may not be
    changed by statute unless specifically so provided by the
    general assembly. Dellovade v. Charnes, 633 P.2d 531 (Colo.
    App. 1981).</P>
    <P>
    <B>Basis for suspensions.</B>Where, in the 24-month period
    preceding April 16, 1972, the date on which appellant committed
    traffic violations for which he was subsequently convicted, the
    only points accumulated by him were during the four months
    ending with April 16, 1972, the only possible basis for his
    first suspension was the acquisition of 12 points during the
    12-month period ending with April 16, 1972, and where, during
    the year immediately succeeding April 16, 1972, he was awarded
    7 more points, he was subject to a second suspension of his
    license for 18 or more points resulting from violations
    occurring in a 24-month period. Perlmutter v. State, Dept. of
    Rev.,191 Colo. 517, 554 P.2d 691 (1976).</P>
    <P>
    <B>The language of subsection (13)(a) is unambiguous</B>and the
    denial by the department of revenue of plaintiff's application
    for a second probationary license was proper because issuance
    of a second probationary license within a five-year period is
    prohibited regardless of whether alcohol-related offenses were
    involved. Howard v. Colo. Dept. of Rev., 680 P.2d 1336 (Colo.
    App. 1984).</P>
    <P>
    <B>Section permits no "grace period"</B>within which a person

    <P>
    <B>Suspensions ending seven years prior in time not considered
    in probationary license hearing.</B>For the purpose of
    examining one's driving history in appraising an application
    for a probationary license, the department may not consider any
    suspension in which the ordered period has ended prior to seven
    years before the hearing. Edwards v. State, Dept. of Rev., 42

    <P>
    <B>Department may allow review of seven-year record when
    processing probationary license.</B>The department has not
    exceeded its authority by allowing the hearing officer to
    consider the licensee's record for a period of seven years when
    processing a probationary license request even though this
    section sets 24 months as the maximum period for which point
    accumulations are to be examined in determining whether a
    license should be suspended. Peshel v. Motor Vehicle Div., 43
    Colo. App. 58, 602 P.2d 875 (1979).</P>
    <P>
    <B>Validity of probationary license.</B>A probationary license,
    issued during a period of suspension, is valid until the
    licensee pays the restoration fee to get back his driver's
    license because the period of suspension continues until the
    restoration fee is paid, unless the expiration date of the
    probationary license is noted on that license. Seigneur v.
    Motor Vehicle Div., 674 P.2d 967 (Colo. App. 1983).</P>
    <P>
    <B>Review of denial of probationary license limited.</B>Where
    there is competent evidence to support the hearing officer's
    findings of aggravating circumstances and lack of mitigating
    circumstances and, therefore, to sustain the denial of a
    probationary license, further review of the soundness of that

  <M>If a written request for a hearing is made after expiration of
  the seven-day period and is accompanied by the person's verified
  statement explaining the failure to make a timely request for a

  If the department finds that the person was unable to make a
  timely request due to lack of actual notice of the suspension,
  factors of physical incapacity such as hospitalization, or
  incarceration, the department shall waive the period of
  limitation, reopen the matter, and grant the hearing request. In
  such case, a stay of the suspension pending issuance of the final

  the hearing unless requested in accordance with subsection (6)(c)
  of this section. The department shall consider all other relevant
  evidence at the hearing, including the reports of other officers
  that are submitted to the department. The reports of other
  officers are not required to be made under oath, but each such
  report must identify the officer making the report. The
  department may consider evidence contained in affidavits from
  persons other than the person requesting the hearing, so long as
  each such affidavit includes the affiant's home or work address
  and telephone number and is dated, signed, and sworn to by the
  affiant under penalty of perjury. The affidavit need not be

  department pursuant to subsection (6)(f) of this section; examine
  and consider documents and copies of documents containing

  defined by rule 201 of article II of the Colorado rules of
  evidence, subject to section 24-4-105 (8), including judicial
  notice of general, technical, or scientific facts within the
  hearing officer's knowledge; compel witnesses to testify or

  necessary to properly perform the hearing officer's duties as
  required by this section; issue subpoenas duces tecum to produce
  books, documents, records, or other evidence; issue subpoenas for

  stop the vehicle at the scene of the accident, or as close to the
  scene as possible, or immediately return to the scene of the
  accident as required by section 42-4-1601. If the presiding
  hearing officer finds in the affirmative on that issue, the
  suspension order shall be sustained and the presiding hearing
  officer shall then consider whether or not to issue a
  probationary license in accordance with subsection (9) of this

  on that issue, the suspension order shall be rescinded.</M></P>

  <P N="(7)(d)">(d)

  shall render an opinion in writing, and a copy shall be provided
  to the person who requested the hearing.</M></P>
  <P N="(7)(e)">(e)
  <M>If the person who requested the hearing fails to appear
  without just cause, the right to a hearing is waived, and the

  <M>Within thirty-five days after the issuance of the final

  for judicial review in the district court in the county of the
  person's residence.</M></P>
  <P N="(8)(b)">(b)
  <M>Judicial review shall be based on the record without taking
  additional testimony. If the court finds that the department
  exceeded its constitutional or statutory authority, made an
  erroneous interpretation of the law, acted in an arbitrary and
  capricious manner, or made a determination that is unsupported by
  the evidence in the record, the court may reverse the
  department's determination.</M></P>
  <P N="(8)(c)">(c)
  <M>The filing of a petition for judicial review does not result
  in an automatic stay of the suspension order. The court may grant
  a stay of the order only upon motion and hearing and upon a
  finding that there is a reasonable probability that the person
  will prevail on the merits and that the person will suffer
  irreparable harm if the order is not stayed.</M></P>
  <P N="(9)">(9)
  <M>A presiding hearing officer may issue a probationary license
  for a period not to exceed the period of suspension for the
  purpose of driving for reasons of employment, education, health,
  or other necessities as determined by the presiding hearing
  officer, which license may contain such restrictions as the
  department deems reasonable and necessary and which may
  thereafter be subject to cancellation as a result of any
  violation of the restrictions imposed therein. The presiding
  hearing officer may refuse to issue a probationary license if the
  department finds that aggravating circumstances exist to indicate
  the individual is unsafe for driving for any purpose. In refusing
  to issue a probationary license, the department shall make
  specific findings of fact to support such refusal. Such
  aggravating circumstances must be matters other than the facts
  and circumstances of the case giving rise to suspension under
  this section.</M></P>

  <B>First-time offender interlock removal.</B>A person with an
  interlock-restricted license issued pursuant to sub-subparagraph
  (A) of this subparagraph (II) shall be eligible for a license
  without the restriction required by this section if the
  department's monthly monitoring reports required in subsection
  (6) of this section show that, for four consecutive monthly
  reporting periods, the approved ignition interlock device did not
  interrupt or prevent the normal operation of the motor vehicle
  due to an excessive breath alcohol content or did not detect that
  there has been tampering with the device, there have been no
  other reports of circumvention or tampering, and there are no
  grounds to extend the restriction pursuant to paragraph (d) of
  subsection (7) of this section. If the department determines that
  a person is eligible for a license without the restriction
  required by this section pursuant to this sub-subparagraph (B),
  the department shall serve upon the person a notice of such
  eligibility. A person who has not been served but who believes he
  or she is eligible for a license without the restriction required
  by this section pursuant to this sub-subparagraph (B) may request
  a hearing on his or her eligibility. The provisions of this

  person shall have satisfied all conditions for reinstatement
  imposed by law including time periods for non-alcohol-related
  restraints; except that a person whose license was also
  restrained for driving under restraint pursuant to section

  restriction on the person's license for an additional twelve
  months after the expiration of the existing interlock
  restriction. The department shall notify the person that the

    The only discretion the district court has under these

    there is nothing before the district court upon which its

    law which it is required to execute. They are of a governmental
    character. The sole object of the action commenced in the
    district court is to obtain an injunction to restrain the
    department from performing its duties. If this should be
    permitted in a direct proceeding, the result would be to
    directly subject executive officials to the jurisdiction of the
    courts when acting within their province and strip them of
    their constitutional powers. This is an authority that the

    <B>Driver may collaterally attack constitutionality</B>of
    uncounseled prior traffic offense convictions underlying the
    administrative order of suspension when prosecuted for driving
    under suspension. People v. Gandy, 685 P.2d 165 (Colo.
    1984)(case arose prior to enactment of ยง 42-4-1505.3).</P>

    is suspended or revoked.</B>Davis v. City &amp; County of
    Denver, 140 Colo. 30, 342 P.2d 674 (1959).</P>
    <P>
    <B>Municipal ordinance dealing with such penalty is
    invalid.</B>Power to establish a licensing system carries with
    it authority to revoke and to penalize the driving of a motor
    vehicle while the license of the operator has been suspended or
    revoked, and the subject being predominately statewide and
    general, a municipal ordinance dealing with the identical
    subject is invalid. Davis v. City &amp; County of Denver, 140
    Colo. 30, 342 P.2d 674 (1959).</P>
    <P>
    <B>Notwithstanding ยง 43-5-207, recognizing the power of
    municipalities to regulate particular areas of traffic</B>--as
    parking, signal control, one-way streets, speed and traffic at
    intersections--does not specifically authorize such
    municipalities to punish the operator of a vehicle driving
    without a license, this authority has been preempted by the
    state and withheld from a municipality. Davis v. City &amp;
    County of Denver, 140 Colo. 30, 342 P.2d 674 (1959).</P>
    <P>
    <B>Renewing suspension pending hearing where suspension
    terminated violates due process.</B>The practice of renewing
    the suspension of a license, pending a hearing at which
    vacation of the renewed suspension is a certainty, violates due
    process of law. Harris v. Colo., 516 F. Supp. 1128 (D. Colo.
    1981).</P>
    <P>
    <B>Knowledge of fact of revocation is an essential
    element</B>of crime of driving while license revoked. Jolly v.
    People, 742 P.2d 891 (Colo. 1987).</P>
    <P>
    <B>Driving while license is denied, suspended, or
    revoked</B>pursuant to this section and driving after
    revocation pursuant to ยง 42-2-206 proscribe the same act, and
    defendant may not be convicted or punished under both statutes.
    People v. Rodriguez, 849 P.2d 799 (Colo. App. 1992).</P>
    <P>
    <B>Driving while license denied, suspended, or revoked</B>under
    this section does not merge with ยง 42-2-206. A person is liable
    to be convicted under both provisions. The elements are
    different because "operating" is a different standard than
    "driving" and "highways" do not include private ways. People v.
    Zubiate, 2013 COA 69, 411 P.3d 757, aff'd, 2017 CO 17, 390 P.3d
    394, (disagreeing with People v. Rodriguez cited above)
    (disapproved by supreme court in People v. Rock, 2017 CO 84,
    402 P.3d 472).</P>
    <P>
    <B>Driving under restraint under this section is a lesser
    included offense of driving after revocation</B>under ยง
    42-2-206. Although a person may commit driving after revocation
    without committing driving under restraint, a person could not
    commit driving under restraint without committing driving after
    revocation. People v. Wambolt, 2018 COA 88, 431 P.3d 681;
    People v. Tun, 2021 COA 34, 486 P.3d 490.</P>
    <P>The "drive" element of driving under restraint is included
    within the "operate" element of driving after revocation
    because a person who drives a car necessarily operates it.
    People v. Wambolt, 2018 COA 88, 431 P.3d 681.</P>
    <P>
    <B>The department of revenue can impose an additional period of
    revocation under subsection (3) upon receiving an accident
    report</B>for a person who is driving under revocation and
    after finding that the person was driving under restraint at
    the time of the accident. The statute authorizes such
    additional time without a conviction of driving under
    restraint, and such authorization is consistent with the
    remedial nature of the statute. Colo. Dept. of Rev. v. Garner,
    66 P.3d 106 (Colo. 2003).</P>
    <P>
    <B>Driving under restraint charges may be prosecuted only for
    those whose licenses have been suspended, denied, or revoked in
    the state of Colorado.</B>Therefore, charge of driving under
    restraint was dismissed against driver whose Massachusetts
    license was under restraint. Driving without a valid license is
    a lesser included offense of driving under restraint and the
    violation notice could proceed on the charge of driving without
    a license. United States v. Rogers, 865 F. Supp. 718 (D. Colo.
    1994)(decided prior to 1994 repeal and reenactment).</P>
    <P>
    <B>Statute authorizes only a permissive inference of the
    licensee's knowledge</B>of fact of revocation and not a
    conclusive presumption and, therefore, comports with due
    process of law. Jolly v. People, 742 P.2d 891 (Colo. 1987).</P>
    <P>
    <B>Subsection (3) furthers a legitimate governmental
    purpose</B>by penalizing drivers under denial, suspension, or
    revocation who commit additional traffic offenses and does not
    violate equal protection guarantees. Allen v. Charnes, 674 P.2d
    378 (Colo. 1984).</P>
    <P>
    <B>Driving under restraint is a public welfare offense</B>that
    requires actual knowledge or knowledge of circumstances
    sufficient to cause a reasonable person to be aware that such
    person's license to drive was under restraint. People v.
    Ellison, 14 P.3d 1034 (Colo. 2000); People v. Boulden, 2016 COA
    109, 381 P.3d 454.</P>
    <P>
    <B>The second part of the driving under restraint statute that
    requires a reasonable person standard does not violate due
    process of law</B>under the federal and Colorado Constitutions.
    People v. Ellison, 14 P.3d 1034 (Colo. 2000).</P>
    <P>
    <B>Requiring "knowledge" limits punishment to those</B>who are
    subjectively aware of circumstances that would lead a
    responsible driver to realize his or her license was under
    restraint. Thus the "knowledge" requirement encourages a driver
    to monitor his or her infractions on the driving privilege
    hereby advancing the state interest in promoting driver
    responsibility. People v. Ellison, 14 P.3d 1034 (Colo.
    2000).</P>
    <P>
    <B>Section merely permits department to exercise power to renew

    <B>Section is not unconstitutional as violative of equal
    protection,</B>despite the contention that it has created
    classifications providing that habitual traffic offenders be
    subjected to mandatory sentencing, whereas other offenders
    whose conduct is of far greater culpability may be granted
    probation or be given suspended sentences. People v. Scott, 200
    Colo. 365, 615 P.2d 680 (1980). 
    <P>
    <B>Punishment is not cruel and unusual.</B>The punishment
    mandated by this section is not so disparate to the gravity of
    the offense as to constitute cruel and unusual punishment.
    People v. Shaver, 630 P.2d 600 (Colo. 1981).</P>
    <P>
    <B>Procedures upon which prosecutions under section are based
    are fundamentally fair,</B>are adequate to assure an accurate
    determination of habitual traffic offender status, and accord
    due process of law to a licensee later accused of violating
    this section. People v. McKnight, 200 Colo. 486, 617 P.2d 1178
    (1980).</P>
    <P>
    <B>Constitutional standards for voluntary and understanding
    plea of guilty clearly are applicable</B>to the traffic offense
    convictions of driving under suspension. People v. Shaver, 630
    P.2d 600 (Colo. 1981).</P>
    <P>
    <B>Section must be construed to prohibit use of conviction
    obtained without benefit or waiver of counsel</B>as a part of
    the foundation for the sentence of imprisonment which is
    mandated for violation of that statute. People v. Roybal, 618
    P.2d 1121 (Colo. 1980).</P>
    <P>Absent a valid waiver of the right to counsel, a conviction
    obtained against a defendant who is not represented by counsel
    may not be used to establish habitual traffic offender status
    for the purpose of imposing punishment for violation of this
    section. People v. Hampton, 619 P.2d 48 (Colo. 1980); People v.
    Rocha, 650 P.2d 569 (Colo. 1982).</P>
    <P>A violation of a defendant's constitutional right to counsel
    in a traffic offense proceeding can be asserted as a defense in
    a subsequent prosecution for driving after judgment prohibited
    based in essential part upon conviction of that traffic
    offense. People v. Mascarenas, 632 P.2d 1028 (Colo. 1981).</P>
    <P>
    <B>Notification of criminal penalty for violation not
    required.</B>The department is not required to notify persons
    adjudged habitual traffic offenders of the possible criminal
    penalty for driving in violation of the order of revocation.
    People v. Shaver, 630 P.2d 600 (Colo. 1981).</P>
    <P>
    <B>Crim. P. 11(b)(4), not applicable to this section.</B>Where
    defendant's third conviction makes him subject to enhanced
    punishment as an habitual traffic offender under subsection
    (1), the attainment of this status is not a "penalty" within
    the meaning of Crim. P. 11(b)(4), and the defendant does not
    have to be advised of the possible consequences of multiple
    convictions before a court can increase the punishment for his
    attainment thereof. People v. Heinz, 197 Colo. 102, 589 P.2d
    931 (1979).</P>
    <P>
    <B>Although compliance with Crim. P. 11, may be considered by
    court.</B>Compliance with Crim. P. 11, although not conclusive
    of the issue of a defendant's waiver of counsel, is an
    appropriate factor for the court to consider in resolving a
    defendant's challenge to the admission of the order of
    revocation. People v. Shaver, 630 P.2d 600 (Colo. 1981).</P>
    <P>
    <B>Administrative hearing not "critical stage" of
    prosecution.</B>The department of motor vehicles'
    administrative hearing which results in license revocation
    pursuant to ยง 42-2-203 is not a "critical stage" of the
    prosecution for violation of this section. People v. McKnight,
    200 Colo. 486, 617 P.2d 1178 (1980); People v. Shaver, 630 P.2d
    600 (Colo. 1981).</P>
    <P>
    <B>Driving after revocation pursuant to this section</B>and
    driving while license denied, suspended, or revoked pursuant to
    ยง 42-2-130 proscribe the same act, and defendant may not be
    convicted or punished under both statutes. People v. Rodriguez,
    849 P.2d 799 (Colo. App. 1992) (decided prior to 1994 amendment
    of title 42).</P>
    <P>
    <B>Driving while license denied, suspended, or revoked</B>under
    this section does not merge with ยง 42-2-138. A person is liable
    to be convicted under both provisions. The elements are
    different because "operating" is a different standard than
    "driving" and "highways" do not include private ways. People v.
    Zubiate, 2013 COA 69, 411 P.3d 757, aff'd, 2017 CO 17, 390 P.3d
    394 (disagreeing with People v. Rodriguez cited above)
    (disapproved by supreme court in People v. Rock, 2017 CO 84,
    402 P.3d 472).</P>
    <P>
    <B>Driving under restraint under ยง 42-2-138 is a lesser
    included offense of driving after revocation</B>under this
    section. Although a person may commit driving after revocation
    without committing driving under restraint, a person could not
    commit driving under restraint without committing driving after
    revocation. People v. Wambolt, 2018 COA 88, 431 P.3d 681;
    People v. Tun, 2021 COA 34, 486 P.3d 490.</P>
    <P>The "drive" element of driving under restraint is included
    within the "operate" element of driving after revocation
    because a person who drives a car necessarily operates it.

    <ANNO-TEXT>
    <B>Two elements of crime of driving after judgment prohibited
    are:</B>(1) operation of a motor vehicle in this state; and (2)
    operation of a motor vehicle while the order of revocation of
    the appellant's driver's license as an habitual offender was in
    effect. People v. Moore, 200 Colo. 481, 615 P.2d 726 (1980). 
    <P>
    <B>Proper charge of violation of section must include</B>not
    only an allegation that the license of an accused driver had
    been revoked upon a determination that he was an habitual
    traffic offender but also an allegation that the accused was
    operating a motor vehicle on the highways of this state while
    that revocation was still in effect. People v. Moore, 200 Colo.
    481, 615 P.2d 726 (1980).</P>
    <P>
    <B>Knowledge of revocation order is essential element.</B>As a
    matter of statutory construction, knowledge of the order of
    revocation is an essential element in a driving after judgment
    prohibited prosecution. People v. Lesh, 668 P.2d 1362 (Colo.
    1983); People v. Parga, 964 P.2d 571 (Colo. App. 1998); Griego
    v. People, 19 P.3d 1 (Colo. 2001).</P>
    <P>The prosecution is required to prove the element of
    knowledge of the revocation order in a driving after judgment
    prohibited case, as mailing notice of the order is only prima
    facie proof of its receipt, and is not conclusive. People v.
    Lesh, 668 P.2d 1362 (Colo. 1983).</P>
    <P>
    <B>To satisfy mens rea requirement for conviction on charge of
    felony driving after judgment prohibited, defendant must have
    actual knowledge of habitual traffic offender
    revocation.</B>For purposes of driving after judgment
    prohibited statute, "actual knowledge" is as defined in ยง
    18-1-501 (6). The constructive knowledge definition contained
    in the misdemeanor driving-under-restraint statute is
    inapplicable to the felony offense of driving after judgment
    prohibited. People v. Parga, 964 P.2d 571 (Colo. App. 1998);
    Griego v. People, 19 P.3d 1 (Colo. 2001).</P>
    <P>
    <B>Defendant's driving record relevant to establish knowledge
    of status as an habitual offender.</B>On retrial, jury may
    consider defendant's record of traffic offenses as
    circumstantial evidence suggesting that he has actual knowledge
    that his license had been revoked as an habitual traffic
    offender. People v. Parga, 964 P.2d 571 (Colo. App. 1998).</P>
    <P>
    <B>Improperly instructing jury on required culpable mental
    state is not harmless error.</B>People v. Parga, 964 P.2d 571
    (Colo. App. 1998).</P>
    <P>
    <B>The mens rea element for the offense of driving after
    judgment is not set forth in this section.</B>However, actual
    knowledge of the order of revocation of license as an habitual
    offender is an essential element of the offense. People v.
    Villa-Villa, 983 P.2d 181 (Colo. App. 1997).</P>
    <P>
    <B>A defendant may be convicted under this section not only if
    he actually knew his license had been revoked but also if</B>a
    reasonable person in the defendant's position would have known
    that his license was under revocation as an habitual offender.
    People v. Villa-Villa, 983 P.2d 181 (Colo. App. 1997).</P>
    <P>
    <B>Inability of a defendant to read and understand English does
    not render the notice of revocation insufficient</B>and does
    not, as a matter of law, constitute a defense to knowledge of
    revocation of driving privileges. People v. Villa-Villa, 983
    P.2d 181 (Colo. App. 1997).</P>
    <P>
    <B>When the documentary evidence included a proof of service,
    dated shortly before the alleged violation, of a notice stating
    that it was unlawful for the defendant to operate a motor
    vehicle and a certified copy of defendant's driving record,
    dated shortly afer the alleged violation, showing that his
    license was under revocation,</B>it was reasonable to conclude
    both that defendant's license was under revocation at the time
    of the alleged violation and that he knew of the revocation.
    People v. Espinoza, 195 P.3d 1122 (Colo. App. 2008).</P>
    <P>
    <B>"Conviction" to include plea of guilty.</B>In enacting ยง
    42-2-201 et seq., the general assembly was concerned with
    identifying and punishing habitual offenders of traffic laws.
    To give effect to that expressed concern, the definition of the
    term "conviction" must include a plea of guilty. Walker v.
    District Court, 199 Colo. 128, 606 P.2d 70 (1980).</P>
    <P>
    <B>Sentence requirement in this section remains
    mandatory</B>and is not subject to plea bargaining to obtain a
    deferred sentence as generally allowed by ยง 16-7-403. Walker v.
    District Court, 199 Colo. 128, 606 P.2d 70 (1980).</P>
    <P>
    <B>The term "operate" does not require actual movement of a
    vehicle.</B>"Operate" is the action of causing something to
    occur or to cause to function, usually by direct personal
    effort. People v. Gregor, 26 P.3d 530 (Colo. App. 2000); People
    v. Stewart, 55 P.3d 107 (Colo. 2002); People v. Valdez, 2014
    COA 125, 411 P.3d 94.</P>
    <P>
    <B>The trial court did not err in failing to define "operate"
    for the jury as requiring actual movement</B>because a person
    who is behind the wheel of a car with the engine running is in
    actual physical control of the vehicle and thus driving. People
    v. Gregor, 26 P.3d 530 (Colo. App. 2000).</P>
    <P>
    <B>Operating a motor vehicle means exercising physical control
    over a motor vehicle.</B>The threat that impaired driving
    statutes seek to avoid is that a vehicle will be put into
    motion by an intoxicated occupant and thus pose a risk to the
    safety of the occupant and others. The risk remains present
    when the reason for a vehicle's inoperability is a temporary
    condition that can be quickly remedied. The "reasonably capable
    of being rendered operable" standard distinguishes between a
    vehicle that has simply run out of gas and one that is in a
    condition that renders it "totally inoperable". People v.

    1981).</P>
    <P>The defendant's burden on a challenge to the admission of an
    order of revocation is to make a prima facie showing that one
    or more of the underlying convictions was constitutionally
    invalid. People v. Shaver, 630 P.2d 600 (Colo. 1981); People v.
    Swann, 770 P.2d 411 (Colo. 1989).</P>
    <P>
    <B>What constitutes prima facie showing.</B>A prima facie
    showing in the context of a challenge to the validity of a
    conviction means evidence which, when considered in a light
    most favorable to the defendant and all reasonable inferences
    therefrom are drawn in his favor, would permit the court to
    find that one or more of the traffic offense convictions
    essential to the order of revocation was not obtained in
    accordance with the constitutional right to effective
    assistance of counsel or due process of law. People v. Shaver,
    630 P.2d 600 (Colo. 1981); People v. Mascarenas, 632 P.2d 1028

    Swann, 770 P.2d 411 (Colo. 1989).</P>
    <P>
    <B>Burden of establishing constitutional validity is by
    preponderance.</B>The appropriate burden for the prosecution is
    to establish the constitutional validity of a traffic
    conviction by a preponderance of the evidence. People v.
    Shaver, 630 P.2d 600 (Colo. 1981).</P>
    <P>
    <B>Burden is distinct from proving guilt beyond reasonable
    doubt.</B>This standard of proof on admissibility of prior
    convictions is to be distinguished from, and does not in any
    manner implicate, the prosecution's burden of proving to the
    jury the defendant's guilt beyond a reasonable doubt on all
    essential elements of the crime charged. People v. Shaver, 630
    P.2d 600 (Colo. 1981).</P>
    <P>
    <B>Failure to make prima facie showing that prior conviction
    invalid.</B>Where defendant fails to present any affirmative
    evidence to show that the defendant's pleas were involuntary or
    without factual basis, or even that the court failed to inquire
    into these matters when accepting his pleas, the defendant has
    failed to make a prima facie showing that a prior conviction
    was invalid. People v. Fleming, 781 P.2d 1384 (Colo. 1989).</P>
    <P>
    <B>No review in criminal proceeding of administrative
    decision.</B>A defendant's right to demonstrate the
    constitutional invalidity of a prior judicial determination of
    guilt does not include the right to obtain judicial review in a
    criminal proceeding of a prior administrative decision
    affecting defendant's status in other context. People v. Rocha,
    669 P.2d 1366 (Colo. 1983).</P>
    <P>
    <B>A defendant charged under this section cannot collaterally
    attack prior uncounseled speeding convictions where</B>he

  Such verification shall utilize appropriate and accurate

    <B>Annotator's note.</B>Since ยง 42-3-105 is similar to ยง
    42-3-105 as it existed prior to the 2005 amendment to article 3
    of title 42, which resulted in the relocation of provisions,
    relevant cases construing former provisions similar to that
    section have been included in the annotations to this section. 
    <P>
    <B>The purpose of the act</B>is to make automobile titles more
    safe and certain, to protect those who deal therein and to
    obviate the necessity of relying upon circumstantial evidence
    as to the ownership thereof. Blevins v. Truitt, 134 Colo. 88,
    299 P.2d 1100 (1956).</P>
    <P>
    <B>The purpose of requiring the name of the owner in the
    registration of a motor vehicle</B>is for the proper
    identification of the registrant; it follows that a person is
    more readily identified by the name he habitually uses, and a
    regulation which requires an applicant to use a first name
    rather than an initial, which would actually hinder
    identification, contravenes the legislative intent and is
    unlawful. Blevins v. Truitt, 134 Colo. 88, 299 P.2d 1100
    (1956).</P>
    <P>
    <B>Director of revenue not authorized to require registration
    in name not regularly used.</B>This section authorizing the
    director of revenue to make regulations governing the
    registration of motor vehicles, including the name and address
    of the owner and "any other information required by the
    department", does not authorize adoption of a regulation
    defining "name of owner" so as to require registration in a
    name other than that regularly used by the applicant. Blevins
    v. Truitt, 134 Colo. 88, 299 P.2d 1100 (1956).</P>
    <P>
    <B>Payment of specific ownership tax tied to filing of
    registration application.</B>While ยง 42-3-123 does not in so
    many words mention "specific ownership tax", it does provide
    for "registration". And this section provides that the owner,
    upon filing an application for "registration", shall pay, among
    other fees, the "annual specific ownership tax on the vehicle
    for which the license is to issue". So, payment of the specific
    ownership tax is thereby necessarily tied into the act of
    filing an application for registration. Bd. of County Comm'rs
    v. E. J. Rippy &amp; Sons, 161 Colo. 261, 421 P.2d 461
    (1966).</P></ANNO-TEXT>

  <M>The taxable value of every item of classified personal

  change. Regardless of the date of acquisition by an owner, the
  year of manufacture or the year for which designated by the
  manufacturer as a current model shall be considered as the first
  year of service. The maximum rate of specific ownership taxation
  shall apply to the taxable value in the first year of service,
  and annual downward graduations from such maximum rate shall
  apply to such taxable value for the number of later years of
  service specified for each class of personal property.</M></P>

    <P>
    <B>The facial disparity in this section and ยง 42-3-107 between
    ownership tax rates applicable to interstate and intrastate
    vehicles ten years old and older violated the Commerce Clause
    of the United States Constitution</B>where trucking company was
    able to show that the statutes discriminated against interstate
    commerce by unfairly imposing an economic disadvantage upon
    interstate carriers that operated vehicles subject to the tax.
    Riverton Produce Co. v. State, 871 P.2d 1213 (Colo. 1994).</P>
    <P>
    <B>The court concluded that the discriminatory provisions of
    this section and ยง 42-3-107 were severable from the remainder
    of the statutes</B>where the discrimination in tax rates was
    not "inextricably intertwined" with the valid provisions and
    where severing the disparity between interstate and intrastate
    vehicles would not frustrate the legislature's efforts to raise
    revenue for the maintenance of its roads and highways. Riverton
    Produce Co. v. State, 871 P.2d 1213 (Colo. 1994).</P>
    <P>
    <B>Specific ownership tax is in lieu of ad valorem
    taxes.</B>The so-called specific ownership tax on motor
    vehicles and trailers authorized by this section is a tax
    directly fixed according to a prescribed method with reference
    to each particular vehicle by the statute itself, and is in

  <ANNO-NOTE>
    <ANNO-TEXT>
    <B>Annotator's note.</B>Since ยง 42-3-116 is similar to ยง
    42-3-127 as it existed prior to the 2005 amendment to article 3
    of title 42, which resulted in the relocation of provisions,
    relevant cases construing that provision and its predecessors
    have been included in the annotations to this section. 
    <P>
    <B>Legislative intent in adopting subsection (1)</B>was to
    accommodate dealers by not requiring registration of each
    vehicle in the dealer's inventory and to permit dealers to
    operate their vehicles upon highways with the ease of
    transferring one license plate from one vehicle to another.
    Dept. of Rev. v. A &amp; A Auto Wrecking, Inc., 625 P.2d 1021
    (Colo. 1981).</P>
    <P>
    <B>There was no violation when a dealer illegally gave a
    purchaser a dealer plate.</B>The statute was enacted to collect
    taxes and not to protect the public. Liebelt v. Bob Penkhus
    Volvo-Mazda, Inc., 961 P.2d 1147 (Colo. App. 1998).</P>
    <P>
    <B>Department may not limit number of dealer licenses to one
    dealer.</B>A department of revenue regulation, limiting the
    number of dealer license plates that may be issued to an
    automobile dealer, is inconsistent with this section and is,
    therefore, invalid. A &amp; A Auto Wrecking, Inc. v. Dept. of
    Rev., 43 Colo. App. 85, 602 P.2d 10 (1979).</P>
    <P>
    <B>Dealer may not obtain unlimited number of
    plates.</B>Subsection (1) does not provide that a dealer may
    obtain an unlimited number of dealer plates, nor would such an
    interpretation lead to a just and reasonable result. Dept. of
    Rev. v. A &amp; A Auto Wrecking, Inc., 625 P.2d 1021 (Colo.
    1981).</P>
    <P>
    <B>Colorado appellate decisions support the proposition that
    nondelivery of the certificate of title to a motor vehicle does
    not prevent a change of ownership,</B>and that delivery of
    possession constitutes a transfer of ownership as between the
    parties involved. Hall v. Hong Seung Gee, 725 P.2d 1164 (Colo.

    <B>Where the suspect's license plate was obstructed by

    Although after stopping the vehicle, the troopers could see the

    continued obstruction of the plate constituted an ongoing
    license plate violation and thus a reasonable purpose for the
    stop. Because the troopers had a reasonable suspicion and a
    reasonable stop, they properly initiated an investigatory stop.

  <M>Every owner or operator of a motor vehicle operated over any
  public highway of this state who is required to pay the
  passenger-mile tax imposed by sections 42-3-304 and 42-3-306
  shall apply to the department and secure a passenger-mile tax
  permit and shall keep and maintain true and correct records of
  the operations of such motor vehicles, including the number of
  miles operated and the number of passengers carried, in such form
  as to reflect the actual activity of all such motor vehicles and
  as may be prescribed by the department and the public utilities
  commission. Such owner or operator shall preserve all such
  records for a period of four years. The passenger-mile tax permit
  shall remain effective until the owner advises the department of
  a change in ownership or a discontinuance of business or until
  such owner has failed to file tax reports and pay any applicable
  passenger-mile tax for four successive tax periods.</M>
  <P N="(2)">(2)
  <M>For failure to apply for and secure a permit, the executive
  director of the department may impose a penalty in an amount
  equal to twenty-five percent of any tax found to be due and
  payable or twenty-five dollars, whichever is greater.</M></P>
  <P N="(3)">(3)
  <M>Failure or refusal of an owner or operator to keep and

  <M>If an examination of the financial responsibility of an owner

  negotiable certificate of deposit issued by a commercial bank
  doing business in this state and acceptable to the executive
  director is necessary to guarantee payment of the tax, the owner
  or operator may be required to deposit such guarantee with the
  department in an amount no greater than twice the amount of tax
  estimated by the executive director to become due and payable
  each tax period. If the deposit is in cash or a negotiable
  certificate of deposit, it shall be subject to forfeiture upon
  failure of the owner or operator to comply with sections 42-3-304
  to 42-3-308, this section, article 10.1 of title 40, or the rules
  of the department or the public utilities commission; if it is a
  surety bond, it shall be conditioned upon the insured's faithful
  compliance with all applicable statutes and rules.</M></P>

  <M>Failure or refusal of an owner or operator to provide or to

  <M>Legislative declaration.</M></CATCH-LINE>The general assembly
  recognizes the many conflicts which presently exist between the
  state's traffic laws and many of the municipal traffic codes,
  which conflicts lead to uncertainty in the movement of traffic on
  the state's highways and streets. These conflicts are compounded
  by the fact that today's Americans are extremely mobile and that
  while this state enjoys a large influx of traffic from many
  areas, there is some lack of uniformity existing between the
  "rules of the road" of this state and those of other states of
  the nation. The general assembly, therefore, declares it the
  purpose of this article to alleviate these conflicts and lack of
  uniformity by conforming, as nearly as possible, certain of the
  traffic laws of this state with the recommendations of the
  national committee of uniform traffic laws and ordinances as set
  forth in the committee's "Uniform Vehicle Code".</SECTION-TEXT>

  <M>Public officers to obey provisions - exceptions for emergency

  <M>The provisions of this article applicable to the drivers of
  vehicles upon the highways shall apply to the drivers of all
  vehicles owned or operated by the United States, this state, or
  any county, city, town, district, or other political subdivision
  of the state, subject to such specific exceptions as are set
  forth in this article with reference to authorized emergency
  vehicles.</M>
  <P N="(2)">(2)
  <M>The driver of an authorized emergency vehicle, when responding
  to an emergency call, or when in pursuit of an actual or
  suspected violator of the law, or when responding to but not upon
  returning from a fire alarm, may exercise the privileges set
  forth in this section, but subject to the conditions stated in
  this article. The driver of an authorized emergency vehicle
  may:</M></P>
  <P N="(2)(a)">(a)
  <M>Park or stand, irrespective of the provisions of this
  title;</M></P>
  <P N="(2)(b)">(b)
  <M>Proceed past a red or stop signal or stop sign, but only after
  slowing down as may be necessary for safe operation;</M></P>
  <P N="(2)(c)">(c)
  <M>Exceed the lawful speeds set forth in section 42-4-1101 (2) or
  exceed the maximum lawful speed limits set forth in section
  42-4-1101 (8) so long as said driver does not endanger life or
  property;</M></P>
  <P N="(2)(d)">(d)
  <M>Disregard regulations governing directions of movement or
  turning in specified directions.</M></P>
  <P N="(3)">(3)
  <M>The exemptions and conditions provided in paragraphs (b) to
  (d), in their entirety, of subsection (2) of this section for an
  authorized emergency vehicle shall continue to apply to section
  24-10-106 (1)(a), C.R.S., only when such vehicle is making use of
  audible or visual signals meeting the requirements of section
  42-4-213, and the exemption granted in paragraph (a) of
  subsection (2) of this section shall apply only when such vehicle
  is making use of visual signals meeting the requirements of
  section 42-4-213 unless using such visual signals would cause an
  obstruction to the normal flow of traffic; except that an
  authorized emergency vehicle being operated as a police vehicle
  while in actual pursuit of a suspected violator of any provision
  of this title need not display or make use of audible or visual
  signals so long as such pursuit is being made to obtain
  verification of or evidence of the guilt of the suspected
  violator. Nothing in this section shall be construed to require
  an emergency vehicle to make use of audible signals when such
  vehicle is not moving, whether or not the vehicle is
  occupied.</M></P>
  <P N="(4)">(4)
  <M>The provisions of this section shall not relieve the driver of
  an authorized emergency vehicle from the duty to drive with due

  reckless disregard for the safety of others.</M></P>
  <P N="(5)">(5)
  <M>The state motor vehicle licensing agency shall designate any
  particular vehicle as an authorized emergency vehicle upon a
  finding that the designation of that vehicle is necessary to the
  preservation of life or property or to the execution of emergency
  governmental functions. Such designation shall be in writing, and
  the written designation shall be carried in the vehicle at all
  times, but failure to carry the written designation shall not
  affect the status of the vehicle as an authorized emergency
  vehicle.</M></P></SECTION-TEXT>

    <P>
    <B>Proper standard under subsection (2)</B>for determining
    whether an emergency vehicle operator was responding to an
    emergency call is an objective standard from the perspective of
    the reasonable emergency vehicle operator. Courts must decide
    whether the emergency vehicle operator reasonably believed that
    he or she was responding to an emergency based on information
    he or she knew or should have known. Corsentino v. Cordova, 4
    P.3d 1082 (Colo. 2000).</P>
    <P>
    <B>Proper standard under subsection (2)(c)</B>for determining
    whether an emergency vehicle driver endangered life or property
    while speeding is to ask whether the emergency vehicle
    operator's speed created an unreasonable risk of injury or
    damage to life or property. Courts should limit their inquiry
    to the relationship between the conduct of the emergency
    operator prior to the accident and the circumstances
    surrounding the conduct and important factors include, but are
    not limited to, the legal speed limit in the area, the speed at
    which the operator was driving, the conditions of the road, and
    the type of area in which the operator was driving. Corsentino
    v. Cordova, 4 P.3d 1082 (Colo. 2000).</P>
    <P>
    <B>Firefighters and city immune from liability</B>when an
    eight-foot section of hard suction hose came loose from the
    truck and plaintiff drove over the hose, causing personal
    injury and damage to the car, because the fire truck was
    responding to a fire alarm and was using its emergency lights
    and sirens. City of Grand Junction v. Sisneros, 957 P.2d 1026
    (Colo. 1998).</P>
    <P>
    <B>Police officer not immune from liability</B>if operating an
    emergency vehicle with "reckless disregard for the safety of
    others". Zapp v. Kukuris, 847 P.2d 150 (Colo. App. 1992).</P>
    <P>
    <B>Running a red light without slowing down is not within the
    provisions of subsection (2)(b).</B>Therefore, the government
    may be held liable for an accident resulting from such conduct.
    Tunget v. Bd. of County Comm'rs, 992 P.2d 650 (Colo. App.
    1999).</P>
    <P>
    <B>Under the emergency vehicle exception provided for by
    subsection (2)(c) of this section and ยง 24-10-106 (1)(a),</B>a
    trial court must find that a police officer who exceeded the
    speed limit in pursuit of a fleeing crime suspect did not
    endanger life or property before granting immunity from a
    lawsuit resulting from a pursuit-related traffic accident. Case
    remanded where the trial court dismissed the lawsuit for lack
    of subject matter jurisdiction based on sovereign immunity
    without making such a finding. Quintana v. City of Westminster,
    8 P.3d 527 (Colo. App. 2000).</P>
    <P>
    <B>The general assembly chose not to apply the conditions of
    subsection (2) of this section to the indemnification
    provisions of ยง 24-10-110 (1)(b)(II)</B>because this section
    refers only to section 24-10-106 (1)(a). A public entity does
    not have immunity if an operator of an emergency vehicle speeds
    and endangers life or property in violation of subsection
    (2)(c) of this section, but the public entity is liable for any
    claims against the operator of the emergency vehicle. Only when
    the operator's acts causing the injuries are willful and wanton
    is the operator personally liable. Corsentino v. Cordova, 4
    P.3d 1082 (Colo. 2000).</P>
    <P>
    <B>Public entity and its employees immune from tort liability
    if employee operating police vehicle while in actual pursuit of
    a suspected violator of title 42,</B>even if the employee is
    not using the vehicle's emergency lights or sirens, if the
    pursuit is made to obtain verification of or evidence of the
    guilt of the suspected violator. Tidwell v. City &amp; County
    of Denver, 62 P.3d 1020 (Colo. App. 2002), rev'd on other
    grounds, 83 P.3d 75 (Colo. 2003).</P>
    <P>
    <B>Police officer was engaged in a pursuit within the
    provisions of subsection (3)</B>when the driver of a car fled
    the scene in a clear attempt to avoid arrest or further
    investigation and the officer followed the car. Tidwell v. City
    &amp; County of Denver, 83 P.3d 75 (Colo. 2003).</P>
    <P>
    <B>Police officer's pursuit was not investigatory in
    nature</B>when the officer already had authority to stop and
    arrest the driver of a car and the officer was pursuing the
    driver of the car for that reason. Therefore the officer was
    required to activate his emergency signals in order for the
    city to claim the protection of governmental immunity under the
    Governmental Immunity Act. Tidwell v. City &amp; County of
    Denver, 83 P.3d 75 (Colo. 2003).</P>
    <P>
    <B>Police officer's alleged conduct could be viewed as reckless
    and conscience-shocking for purposes of 42 U.S.C. ยง
    1983.</B>Police officer's alleged conduct, particularly his
    decision to speed against a red light through an intersection
    on a major boulevard without slowing down or activating his
    siren in non-emergency circumstances, all in violation of state
    law and police regulations, could be viewed as reckless and
    conscience-shocking. Williams v. City &amp; County of Denver,
    99 F.3d 1009 (10th Cir. 1996).</P>
    <P>
    <B>Dismissal of claim based on simple negligence in operation
    of an emergency vehicle was proper,</B>since standard of care
    created in subsection (4) is "reckless disregard". Zapp v.

  Nothing in this section is meant to preclude the use of audible
  warning devices that are activated when the vehicle is backing.
  Any authorized emergency vehicle may be equipped with an audible

    <P>
    <B>The plain language of this section indicates that "safety
    belt system" refers to all of the safety belts that have been
    installed in a motor vehicle</B>to restrain drivers and front
    seat passengers. The language of this section reflects that a
    motor vehicle may contain any number, type, or combination of
    belts within its "safety belt system". The term "safety belt
    system" does not mean the belts at a particular seat. Rather, a
    "safety belt system" is comprised of the many belts contained
    within a motor vehicle to restrain drivers and front seat
    passengers. Carlson v. Ferris, 85 P.3d 504 (Colo. 2003).</P>
    <P>
    <B>Because the language of subsection (2) does not include the
    term "system", the general assembly intended "safety belt" to
    refer to the belts that have been installed in a particular
    seat</B>pursuant to federal motor vehicle safety standards.
    Carlson v. Ferris, 85 P.3d 504 (Colo. 2003).</P>
    <P>
    <B>Drivers and front seat passengers of automobiles that have
    been equipped with a lap and a shoulder belt</B>pursuant to
    federal motor vehicle safety standards must wear both the lap
    and the shoulder belt to comply with subsection (2). Carlson v.
    Ferris, 85 P.3d 504 (Colo. 2003).</P>
    <P>
    <B>Driver is required to fasten all safety belts included in a
    motor vehicle's safety belt system</B>to comply with subsection
    (2) in order to defeat a claim for failure to mitigate under
    subsection (7). Carlson v. Ferris, 58 P.3d 1055 (Colo. App.

    <P>
    <B>A jury instruction regarding the affirmative defense of
    failure to wear a seatbelt</B>should be given when it can be
    inferred with reasonable probability that pain and suffering
    will occur because of the plaintiff's failure to wear a
    seatbelt. Anderson v. Watson, 929 P.2d 6 (Colo. App. 1996)

    of appeals in Anderson v. Watson annotated above).</P>

    <P>
    <B>Evidence sufficient to allow seat belt defense under
    subsection (7)</B>where husband testified that he was wearing a
    seat belt and investigating officer testified that the husband
    had reported that he was not wearing a seat belt at time of
    accident. Askew v. Gerace, 851 P.2d 199 (Colo. App. 1992)
    (supreme court in Anderson v. Watson, 953 P.2d 1284 (Colo.

    <P>
    <B>Lack of seat belt use is admissible evidence at trial</B>but
    only to reduce an award of damages for pain and suffering. Wark
    v. McClellan, 68 P.3d 574 (Colo. App. 2003).</P>
    <P>
    <B>No medical testimony required to show plaintiff's failure to
    wear a seat belt contributed to plaintiff's pain and
    suffering.</B>Askew v. Gerace, 851 P.2d 199 (Colo. App. 1992);
    Anderson v. Watson, 929 P.2d 6 (Colo. App. 1996) (supreme court

    <P>
    <B>Defendant must prove a prima facie case of seat belt nonuse
    before</B>the appropriate instruction on that defense can go to
    the jury if the defendant chooses to raise that defense.
    Anderson v. Watson, 953 P.2d 1284 (Colo. 1998) (disagreeing
    with the reasoning of the court of appeals in Anderson v.
    Watson and Askew v. Gerace annotated above).</P>

  <P N="(2)(a)(II)">(II)
  <M>Insofar as such rules and regulations require the use of

  entity of the state of Colorado to retain legal counsel as
  provided by law to request the federal environmental protection

  qualified carrier company. The carrier company shall maintain a
  copy of such annual permit in each vehicle operating as a longer
  vehicle combination; except that, if a peace officer, as
  described in section 16-2.5-101, C.R.S., or an authorized agent
  of the department of transportation may determine that the permit
  can be electronically verified at the time of contact, a copy of
  the permit need not be in each vehicle. The fee for the permit
  shall be two hundred fifty dollars per year.</M>
  <P N="(1)(b)">(b)
  <M>Notwithstanding the amount specified for the fee in paragraph
  (a) of this subsection (1), the executive director of the
  department by rule or as otherwise provided by law may reduce the
  amount of the fee if necessary pursuant to section 24-75-402 (3),
  C.R.S., to reduce the uncommitted reserves of the fund to which
  all or any portion of the fee is credited. After the uncommitted
  reserves of the fund are sufficiently reduced, the executive
  director of the department by rule or as otherwise provided by
  law may increase the amount of the fee as provided in section
  24-75-402 (4), C.R.S.</M></P>
  <P N="(1)(c)">(c)
  <M>The department shall provide the option to a company filing
  for a permit under this section to file an express consent waiver
  that enables the company to designate a company representative to
  be a party of interest for a violation of this section. The
  appearance of the company representative in a court hearing
  without the operator when the operator has signed such waiver
  shall not be deemed the practice of law in violation of article
  93 of title 13.</M></P>

  Notwithstanding any other restriction set forth in this section,
  such combination may have up to eleven axles when used to
  transport empty trailers.</M></P>
  <P N="(2)(c)">(c)
  <M>An unladen truck tractor, a semitrailer, and a single trailer,
  one trailer of which is not more than forty-eight feet long, the
  other trailer of which is not more than twenty-eight feet six

  considered a trailer. The shorter trailer shall be operated as
  the rear trailer.</M></P>
  <P N="(2)(d)">(d)
  <M>A truck and single trailer, having an overall length of not
  more than eighty-five feet, the truck of which is not more than
  thirty-five feet long and the trailer of which is not more than
  forty feet long. For the purposes of this paragraph (d), a
  semitrailer used with a converter dolly shall be considered a

  <M>Upon action by the congress of the United States to lift the
  freeze imposed by the federal "Intermodal Surface Transportation
  Efficiency Act of 1991", Pub.L. 102-240, as amended, concerning
  the use of longer vehicle combinations, either by the total
  freeze being lifted by congress or by the approval of pilot
  projects to expand the use of longer vehicle combinations by the
  states, the department of transportation shall undertake a
  process to evaluate both interstate and state highways for
  possible authorization by the department of additional highway
  segments for inclusion by the general assembly in paragraph (a)
  of this subsection (3). During the review process, the department
  shall solicit input from all relevant stakeholders and shall work

  <M>An authentication of paid ad valorem taxes, after notification
  of such movement to the county treasurer, may serve as a permit
  for movement of manufactured homes on public streets or highways
  under the county's jurisdiction. An authentication of paid ad
  valorem taxes from the county treasurer of the county from which
  the manufactured home is to be moved, after notification of such
  movement has been provided to the county assessor of the county
  to which the manufactured home is to be moved, pursuant to
  section 39-5-205, C.R.S., may also serve as a permit for the
  movement of manufactured homes from one adjoining county to an
  adjoining county on streets and highways under local
  jurisdiction. The treasurer shall issue along with the
  authentication of paid ad valorem taxes a transportable
  manufactured home permit. The treasurer may establish and collect
  a fee, which shall not exceed ten dollars, for issuing the
  authentication of paid ad valorem taxes and the transportable
  manufactured home permit. Such transportable manufactured home
  permit shall be printed on an eleven inch by six inch fluorescent
  orange card and shall contain the following information: The name
  and address of the owner of the mobile home; the name and address
  of the mover; the transport number of the mover, a description of
  the mobile home including the make, year, and identification or
  serial number; the county authentication number; and an
  expiration date. The expiration date shall be set by the
  treasurer, but in no event shall the expiration date be more than
  thirty days after the date of issue of the permit. Such
  transportable manufactured home permit shall be valid for a
  single trip only. The transportable manufactured home permit
  shall be prominently displayed on the rear of the mobile home
  during transit of the mobile home. Peace officers and local tax
  and assessment officials may request, and upon demand shall be
  shown, all moving permits, tax receipts, or certificates required
  by this subsection (2). Nothing in this section shall require a
  permit from a county treasurer for the movement of a new
  manufactured home. For the purposes of this section, a new
  manufactured home is one in transit under invoice or
  manufacturer's statement of origin which has not been previously
  occupied for residential purposes.</M></P>

  paragraph (a) of subsection (1.5) of this section, an annual
  fleet permit. The application shall be accompanied by a
  certificate or other proof of public liability insurance in
  amounts of not less than one hundred thousand dollars per person
  and three hundred thousand dollars per accident for all
  manufactured homes moved within this state by the permit holder
  during the effective term of the permit. Each application for a
  single trip permit shall be accompanied by an authentication of
  paid ad valorem taxes on the used manufactured home.</M></P>
  <P N="(2)(b)(II)">(II)
  <M>Holders of permits shall keep and maintain, for not less than
  three calendar years, records of all manufactured homes moved in
  whole or in part within this state, which records shall include
  the plate number of the towing vehicle; the year, make, serial
  number, and size of the unit moved, together with date of the
  move; the place of pickup; and the exact address of the final
  destination and the county of final destination and the name and
  address of the landowner of the final destination. These records
  shall be available upon request within this state for inspection
  by the state of Colorado or any of its ad valorem taxing
  governmental subdivisions.</M></P>
  <P N="(2)(b)(III)">(III)
  <M>Holders of permits shall obtain an authentication of paid ad
  valorem taxes through the date of the move from the owner of a
  used manufactured home or from the county treasurer of the county
  from which the used manufactured home is being moved. Permit
  holders shall notify the county treasurer of the county from
  which the manufactured home is being moved of the new exact
  address of the final destination and the county of final
  destination of the manufactured home and the name and address of
  the landowner of the final destination, and, if within the state,
  the county treasurer shall forward copies of the used
  manufactured home tax certificate to the county assessor of the
  destination county. County treasurers may compute ad valorem
  manufactured home taxes due based upon the next preceding year's
  assessment prorated through the date of the move and accept
  payment of such as payment in full.</M></P>
  <P N="(2)(b)(IV)">(IV)
  <M>No owner of a manufactured home shall move the manufactured
  home or provide for the movement of the manufactured home without
  being the holder of a paid ad valorem tax certificate and a
  transportable manufactured home permit thereon, and no person
  shall assist such an owner in the movement of such owner's
  manufactured home, including a manufactured home dealer. Except
  as otherwise provided in this paragraph (b), a permit holder who
  moves any manufactured home within this state shall be liable for
  all unpaid ad valorem taxes thereon through the date of such move
  if movement is made prior to payment of the ad valorem taxes due
  on the manufactured home moved.</M></P>
  <P N="(2)(b)(V)">(V)
  <M>In the event of an imminent natural or man-made disaster or
  emergency, including, but not limited to, rising waters, flood,
  or fire, the owner, owner's representative or agent, occupant, or
  tenant of a manufactured home or the mobile home park owner or
  manager, lienholder, or manufactured home dealer is specifically
  exempted from the need to obtain a permit pursuant to this
  section and may move the endangered manufactured home out of the
  danger area to a temporary or new permanent location and may move
  such manufactured home back to its original location without a
  permit or penalty or fee requirement. Upon any such move to a
  temporary location as a result of a disaster or emergency, the
  person making the move or such person's agent or representative
  shall notify the county assessor in the county to which the
  manufactured home has been moved, within twenty days after such
  move, of the date and circumstances pertaining to the move and
  the temporary or permanent new location of the manufactured home.
  If the manufactured home is moved to a new permanent location
  from a temporary location as a result of a disaster or emergency,
  a permit for such move shall be issued but no fee shall be
  assessed.</M></P>

  <B>Authority.</B>(a)
  <M>In addition to any other powers granted by law, the executive
  director of the department of transportation, or the executive
  director's designee, is hereby authorized to negotiate and enter
  into appropriate agreements with other states concerning the
  regional operation or movement of nondivisible oversize or
  overweight vehicles and to facilitate the uniform application,
  administration, and enforcement of applicable laws concerning
  such vehicles.</M></P>
  <P N="(2)(b)">(b)
  <M>A cooperative agreement under this section may include, but
  shall not be limited to, the establishment of a regional permit
  system authorizing the operation or movement of nondivisible
  oversize or overweight vehicles from one state in the region to
  or through another state or states in the region under a single
  trip permit in accordance with the applicable requirements of
  each of the states.</M></P>
  <P N="(2)(c)">(c)
  <M>For the purposes of a regional permit agreement, the

  <P N="(2)(c)(I)">(I)
  <M>Delegate to other states its authority under section 42-4-510
  (1) to issue permits for nondivisible oversize or overweight
  vehicles to operate on Colorado state highways; except that any
  such issuance by another state shall conform, at a minimum, to
  the applicable Colorado permit standards and legal requirements

  this part 5. The department of transportation may also impose
  additional standards concerning such regional permits as it deems
  appropriate.</M></P>
  <P N="(2)(c)(II)">(II)
  <M>Accept a delegation of authority from other states to issue

  <P N="(2)(c)(III)">(III)
  <M>Collect any fees, taxes, and penalties on behalf of other

  <P N="(2)(d)">(d)
  <M>For the purposes of a regional permit agreement, the Colorado
  state patrol, ports of entry, and local law enforcement
  authorities are authorized to enforce the terms of any regional
  permit concerning the operation of the permitted vehicle on state
  highways in Colorado. The Colorado state patrol, ports of entry,
  and local law enforcement authorities are also permitted to take
  necessary actions in Colorado to enforce the applicable
  requirements of the permitting state or states which shall
  include, but shall not be limited to, monitoring licenses and
  other credential usage; enforcing tax restraint, distraint, or
  levy orders; issuing civil citations; and conducting necessary
  safety and equipment inspections.</M></P>
  <P N="(2)(e)">(e)
  <M>The executive director of the department of transportation, or

  or the designee may promulgate such regulations as are necessary
  for the implementation of the provisions of this section.</M></P>
  <P N="(2)(f)">(f)
  <M>Any agreement entered into under the provisions of this

  eligible for compensation, employee rights, or benefits from the
  state of Colorado and shall not be considered to be employees or

  <P N="(2)(g)">(g)
  <M>A cooperative agreement under this section may also provide

    <B>State law does not take away city's power to regulate
    traffic.</B>If a city has power under the state constitution to
    pass ordinances regulating vehicular traffic upon its streets,
    it cannot be deprived of that power by the passage of a state
    law. And if there is a conflict between statute and ordinance
    the ordinance controls. City &amp; County of Denver v. Henry,
    95 Colo. 582, 38 P.2d 895 (1934); Brown v. Maier, 96 Colo. 1,

    <P>
    <B>Question of contributory negligence measured by requirements
    of city ordinance.</B>Thus, in action for injuries sustained in
    automobile accident at an intersection, the question of
    plaintiff's contributory negligence must be measured by the
    requirements of the city ordinance relating to right-of-way at
    intersections and not by this section, where there was a
    conflict. Thomasson v. Burlington Transp. Co., 128 F.2d 355
    (10th Cir. 1942).</P>
    <P>
    <B>Insufficient evidence to charge contributory
    negligence.</B>To properly apply the "look but not see" rule,
    as a matter of law, it is elemental that the approaching
    vehicle must be plainly visible and that the view of it must be
    unobstructed. If the evidence on these points is not clear or
    is disputed, then it remains a fact question for the trier of
    the facts to resolve. The effect of these findings by the trial
    court is that the evidence was insufficient to charge the
    defendant with contributory negligence when plaintiff
    negligently failed to yield right-of-way. Hernandez v. Ratliff,
    172 Colo. 129, 470 P.2d 579 (1970).</P>
    <P>
    <B>Need not yield right-of-way to one already at fault.</B>A
    driver cannot be required to yield the right-of-way when his

    of him who claims it. Boyd v. Close, 82 Colo. 150, 257 P. 1079

    <B>Violation is question for jury.</B>Whether or not either of
    the drivers or both were negligent in violating this section
    and whether said negligence was the proximate cause of this
    accident, or whether it was caused by the joint and concurrent
    negligence of both, are questions of fact for the jury to

    <B>A driver must first signal and then begin moving right or
    left to change lanes.</B>The phrase "indicate an intention to
    ... change lanes" means that a person must signal and then
    change lanes. A person who crosses the line before signaling
    has violated the statute. People v. Gutierrez, 2020 CO 60, 465
    P.3d 577.

    <B>A turn signal is not required for navigating
    roundabouts.</B>A driver need not use a turn signal when
    entering or exiting a roundabout. People v. McBride, 2020 COA

    <P>
    <B>The violation of this section does not, of itself, impose
    liability</B>for injuries caused by an automobile, but the
    person seeking to recover for such injuries must show, not only
    a violation, but that such was the proximate cause of the

    left-hand turn, provided he gave the statutory signals, ยง
    42-4-803, relating to parking outside of a business or

    <B>It is not a reasonable mistake of law</B>to interpret the
    plain language of this section to conclude that a driver is
    required to signal continuously for any set distance before
    changing lanes on a highway and therefore provide reasonable
    suspicion to justify a traffic stop pursuant to the fourth
    amendment when the driver did not signal continuously for two
    hundred feet prior to the lane change. People v. Burnett, 2019

    <P>
    <B>This section contemplates two lines of traffic,</B>and a
    main traveled roadway sufficient in width for their
    accommodation. The statute by its terms clearly requires the
    yielding, as nearly as possible, by each of two vehicles
    approaching each other, of at least one-half of the main
    traveled portion of the roadway. So far as the statute is
    explicit, the main traveled portion may be in the center, or on
    either side of the roadway. One-half of such traveled portion
    is exacted of each traveler, if it is possible to be given; if
    not, then as nearly as possible. Parrish v. Smith, 102 Colo.
    250, 78 P.2d 629 (1938); Parrish v. Smith, 108 Colo. 256, 115
    P.2d 647 (1941).</P>
    <P>
    <B>A situation might arise in which a strict compliance with
    these statutory requirements would be impossible.</B>The
    reasonable provisions are indicated for roadways, and of course
    no fixed application thereof could be made to parts of a road
    under construction, where changing conditions would not permit
    orderly travel under established rules. Parrish v. Smith, 102
    Colo. 250, 78 P.2d 629 (1938); Parrish v. Smith, 108 Colo. 256,
    115 P.2d 647 (1941); Orth v. Bauer, 163 Colo. 136, 429 P.2d 279
    (1967).</P>
    <P>
    <B>In a case in which strict compliance with these statutory
    requirements would be impossible,</B>then the ordinary rules
    are suspended. An ordinarily prudent traveler with any warning
    at all, in approaching a place of construction is bound to know
    that all rules of the road are suspended, and upon entering
    such an area be prepared -- for his own safety and that of
    others -- to submit to, and be governed by, conditions as he
    finds them. In such circumstances he cannot rely upon written
    traffic rules. Parrish v. Smith, 102 Colo. 250, 78 P.2d 629
    (1938); Parrish v. Smith, 108 Colo. 256, 115 P.2d 647
    (1941).</P>
    <P>
    <B>Suspension of rules is question for jury.</B>The question as
    to whether the physical condition of the roadway and its width
    were sufficient to permit a truck to yield one-half of the
    roadway to an automobile, as required by this section, is
    properly submitted to the jury. Parrish v. Smith, 108 Colo.
    256, 115 P.2d 647 (1941).</P>
    <P>
    <B>Violation of section not negligence per se.</B>Violation of
    this section requiring drivers to yield at least half of the
    roadway is not negligence per se. Sanchez v. Staats, 34 Colo.

    <P>
    <B>The rule that driving on the wrong side of the road is

  shall, in connection with their periodic level-of-service
  evaluation of high occupancy vehicle lanes, perform a
  level-of-service evaluation of the use of high occupancy vehicle
  lanes by ILEVs and hybrid vehicles. If the use of high occupancy
  vehicle lanes by ILEVs or hybrid vehicles is determined to cause
  a significant decrease in the level of service for other bona

    <P>
    <B>Speeding classifications constitutional.</B>Decision to
    treat higher rates of speeding as more serious making them
    criminal acts is within legislature's discretion and does not
    create a suspect class or infringe on a fundamental right.
    Drawing a distinction based on speed is rationally related to
    legislative purpose of safety and fuel conservation. People v.
    Lewis, 745 P.2d 668 (Colo. 1987).</P>
    <P>
    <B>It was the legislative intent of the general assembly in
    enacting the provisions of this section effective January 24,
    1974,</B>to fix a speed limit of 55 miles per hour for the
    period during which federal restrictions, as originated in the
    emergency highway energy conservation act, continued under the
    federal aid highway amendments of 1974, until such time as the
    general assembly took further action. People v. Driver, 189
    Colo. 276, 539 P.2d 1248 (1975).</P>
    <P>The general assembly clearly intended to enact an
    enforceable 55 mile-per-hour maximum speed limit, because
    maintenance of federal highway funding was contingent upon
    enactment of such a statute. Olinyk v. People, 642 P.2d 490
    (Colo. 1982).</P>
    <P>
    <B>The policy considerations behind the enactment of this
    section</B>prohibiting the driving of a vehicle in excess of
    the maximum speed of 55 miles per hour is that a driver must be
    charged as a matter of public policy, with the responsibility
    of ensuring that his vehicle is safe, so as to minimize the
    risk inherent in travel on our public highways. People v.
    Caddy, 189 Colo. 353, 540 P.2d 1089 (1975).</P>
    <P>
    <B>Intent to enact enforceable speed limit.</B>It was obviously
    the intention of the general assembly to enact a maximum speed
    limit enforceable through penal sanctions. Olinyk v. People,
    642 P.2d 490 (Colo. 1982).</P>
    <P>
    <B>Speed limit is enforceable.</B>Since the penalty applicable
    to violation of the 55 mile-per-hour speed limit charged by
    complaint and summons is ascertainable, the speed limit is
    enforceable. Olinyk v. People, 642 P.2d 490 (Colo. 1982).</P>
    <P>
    <B>Speed should be no greater than is reasonable and
    prudent.</B>The driver of a motor vehicle must at all times so
    operate it as to maintain reasonable control over it, at a
    speed no greater than is reasonable and prudent under the
    conditions then existing. Bennett v. Hall, 132 Colo. 419, 290
    P.2d 241 (1955); Union P. R. R. v. Snyder, 220 F.2d 388 (10th
    Cir. 1955); Eagan v. Maiselson, 142 Colo. 233, 350 P.2d 567
    (1960); Mayer v. Sampson, 157 Colo. 278, 402 P.2d 185
    (1965).</P>
    <P>
    <B>This section creates a mandatory rebuttable
    presumption</B>that if the prosecution proves that a defendant
    was driving in excess of the posted speed limit, the burden of
    going forward shifts to the defendant to prove that his or her
    speed was reasonable and prudent under the circumstances.
    People v. Hoskin, 2016 CO 63, 380 P.3d 130.</P>
    <P>
    <B>And mandatory rebuttable presumption does not violate due
    process.</B>People v. Hoskin, 2016 CO 63, 380 P.3d 130.</P>
    <P>
    <B>A "special hazard" can be anything that is not a normal
    traffic condition.</B>It need not be an unusual event such as
    heavy traffic after a parade or sports event. A construction
    zone may well be a "special hazard". Dempsey v. Denver Police
    Dept., 2015 COA 67, 353 P.3d 928.</P>
    <P>
    <B>The appropriate signs erected pursuant to subsection (2) of
    this section indicate the speed limit starts at the physical
    location of the sign and continues to be in effect until the
    next different speed limit sign</B>pursuant to the manual
    adopted by the department of transportation pursuant to ยง
    42-4-104. Shafron v. Cooke, 190 P.3d 812 (Colo. App. 2008).</P>
    <P>
    <B>Crime irrespective of intent or scienter.</B>Although the
    absence of a specified "culpable mental state" in this section
    is not conclusive on the issue, it is well settled that the
    general assembly may make a prohibited act a crime,
    irrespective of the elements of intent or scienter, when public
    policy so requires. People v. Caddy, 189 Colo. 353, 540 P.2d
    1089 (1975).</P>
    <P>
    <B>Offense of strict liability.</B>In the absence of a
    specified element of "criminal intent", and because of the
    strong public policy considerations, speeding is an offense of
    strict liability. People v. Caddy, 189 Colo. 353, 540 P.2d 1089
    (1975).</P>
    <P>
    <B>Lack of culpable mental state no defense.</B>Even though
    defendant presented evidence at trial that his speedometer
    reflected a speed 10 miles per hour below the true speed of his
    vehicle, and that he had no knowledge that the speedometer
    reading was in error, or that he should have known of the
    defective speedometer, his lack of a culpable mental state was
    not a defense to the charge of speeding. People v. Caddy, 189
    Colo. 353, 540 P.2d 1089 (1975).</P>
    <P>There is no element of mental culpability required in the
    speeding statute. People v. Caddy, 189 Colo. 353, 540 P.2d 1089

  parking in the area; except that a jurisdiction may specifically
  limit reserved parking on any public street to no less than four
  hours. To limit reserved parking, the jurisdiction must clearly
  post the appropriate time limits in the area. The ability to park

  <P N="(2)(e)(I)">(e)
  <N></N>(I)
  <M>The owner of public or private property may request the
  installation of official signs or pavement markings identifying
  reserved parking spaces. The request operates as a waiver of any

  printing) version of the international building code, or any
  succeeding standard, published by the international code
  council.</M></P>
  <P N="(2)(e)(II)(B)">(B)

  Absolutely No Parking" sign, which blocks neither the access
  aisle nor accessible routes.</M></P>
  <P N="(2)(e)(II)(D)">(D)

  <M>The owner of real property with multiple-family dwellings
  affixed and with reserved parking shall retain the reserved
  parking as commonly owned for the tenants, owners, or visitors of
  the individual units within the dwellings. This subparagraph
  (III) does not prohibit the sale of all commonly owned property
  so long as the reserved parking is not severed from the other
  elements.</M></P>
  <P N="(2)(e)(IV)">(IV)
  <M>A person shall not impose restrictions on the use of disabled
  parking unless specifically authorized by a statute of Colorado
  and a resolution of or ordinance of a political subdivision of
  Colorado and notice of the restriction is prominently posted by a
  sign clearly visible at the parking space.</M></P>
  <P N="(3)(a)">(3)
  <M></M>
  <B>Misuse of reserved parking.</B>(a)
  <M>A person without a disability shall not park in a parking
  space on public or private property that is clearly identified by
  an official sign or by visible pavement markings as being
  reserved parking or as being a passenger loading zone
  unless:</M></P>
  <P N="(3)(a)(I)">(I)
  <M>The person is parking the vehicle for the direct benefit of a
  person with a disability to enter or exit the vehicle while it is
  parked in the reserved parking space; and</M></P>
  <P N="(3)(a)(II)">(II)
  <M>An identifying plate or placard obtained under or authorized
  by section 42-3-204 is displayed in or on the vehicle if the
  license plate or placard is currently valid or has expired less
  than one month before the day the person used the reserved
  parking.</M></P>
  <P N="(3)(a.5)">(a.5)
  <M>A person shall not, while parked in a parking space that

  requires remuneration.</M></P>
  <P N="(3)(b)(I)">(b)
  <N></N>(I)
  <M>A person, after using a reserved parking space that has a time

  to another reserved parking space within one hundred yards of the
  original parking space within the same eight hours in order to

  <P N="(3)(b)(II)(A)">(II)
  <N></N>(A)
  <M>Parking in a time-limited reserved parking space for more than
  three hours for at least three days a week for at least two weeks

  <P N="(3)(b)(II)(B)">(B)
  <M>This subparagraph (II) does not apply to privately owned
  parking spaces.</M></P>
  <P N="(3)(c)">(c)
  <M>A person shall not use reserved parking for a commercial
  purpose unless:</M></P>
  <P N="(3)(c)(I)">(I)
  <M>The purpose relates to transacting business with a business
  the reserved parking is intended to serve; or</M></P>
  <P N="(3)(c)(II)">(II)
  <M>The owner of private property consents to allow the
  use.</M></P>
  <P N="(3)(d)(I)">(d)
  <N></N>(I)
  <M>An employee of an entity shall not use an identifying placard
  issued to the entity unless the employee is transporting persons
  with disabilities.</M></P>
  <P N="(3)(d)(II)">(II)
  <M>For a violation of this paragraph (d), the chief operations
  officer within Colorado of the entity to whom the placard or
  plate was issued and the offending employee are each subject to
  the penalties in section 42-4-1701 (4)(a)(I)(M).</M></P>
  <P N="(3)(d)(III)(A)">(III)
  <N></N>(A)
  <M>It is an affirmative defense to a violation of this paragraph
  (d) for the chief operations officer within Colorado that the
  entity enforces an internal policy controlling access to and use
  of identifying placards issued to the entity.</M></P>
  <P N="(3)(d)(III)(B)">(B)
  <M>If the placard used is expired by operation of section
  42-3-204 (6)(f), it is an affirmative defense to a violation of
  this paragraph (d) that the person did not know the placard was
  expired if the person who used the placard was the person to whom
  it was issued.</M></P>
  <P N="(3)(e)(I)">(e)
  <N></N>(I)
  <M>A person who violates subsection (3)(a) or (3)(a.5) of this
  section is subject to the penalties in section 42-4-1701
  (4)(a)(VIII) and (4)(a)(IX).</M></P>
  <P N="(3)(e)(II)">(II)

  <P N="(4)(a)">(4)
  <M></M>
  <B>Blocking access.</B>(a)
  <M>Regardless of whether a person displays an identifying plate
  or placard, a person shall not park a vehicle so as to block
  reasonable access to curb ramps, passenger loading zones, or
  accessible routes, as identified in 28 CFR part 36 appendix A,
  that are clearly identified unless the person is actively loading
  or unloading a person with a disability.</M></P>
  <P N="(4)(b)">(b)
  <M>A person who violates this subsection (4) is subject to the
  penalties in section 42-4-1701 (4)(a)(VIII).</M></P>

  <M></M>
  <B>Fraud and trafficking.</B>A person is subject to the penalties

  <P N="(5)(b)">(b)

  <P N="(5)(c)">(c)
  <M>Knowingly creates or uses a device intended to give the
  impression that it is an identifying placard when viewed from

  <P N="(6)(a)">(6)
  <M></M>
  <B>Enforcement of reserved parking.</B>(a)
  <M>A peace officer or authorized and uniformed parking
  enforcement official may check the identification of a person
  using an identifying plate or placard in order to determine
  whether the use is authorized.</M></P>
  <P N="(6)(b)(I)">(b)
  <N></N>(I)
  <M>A peace officer or authorized and uniformed parking
  enforcement official may confiscate an identifying placard that
  is being used in violation of this section.</M></P>
  <P N="(6)(b)(II)">(II)
  <M>The peace officer or parking enforcement official shall send a
  confiscated placard to the department unless it is being held as
  evidence for prosecution of a violation of this section. If the
  tag is being held as evidence, the peace officer or parking
  enforcement official shall notify the department of the
  confiscation and pending charges.</M></P>
  <P N="(6)(b)(III)">(III)
  <M>The department shall hold a confiscated placard for thirty
  days and may dispose of the placard after thirty days. The
  department shall release the placard to the person with a
  disability to whom it was issued when the person signs a
  statement under penalty of perjury that he or she was unaware
  that the violator used, or intended to use, the placard in
  violation of this section.</M></P>
  <P N="(6)(c)">(c)
  <M>A peace officer and the department may investigate an
  allegation that a person is violating this section.</M></P>
  <P N="(6)(d)">(d)
  <M>A person who observes a violation of this section may submit
  evidence, including a sworn statement, concerning the violation
  to any law enforcement agency.</M></P>
  <P N="(6)(e)(I)">(e)
  <N></N>(I)
  <M>A peace officer may issue a penalty assessment notice for a
  violation of paragraph (b), (c), or (d) of subsection (3) of this
  section by sending it by certified mail to the registered owner
  of the motor vehicle. The peace officer shall include in the
  penalty assessment notice the offense or infraction, the time and
  place where it occurred, and a statement that the payment of the
  penalty assessment and a surcharge is due within twenty days
  after the issuance of the notice. The department receives payment
  of the penalty assessment by the due date if the payment is
  received or postmarked by the twentieth day after the vehicle
  owner received the penalty assessment notice.</M></P>
  <P N="(6)(e)(II)">(II)
  <M>If the penalty assessment and surcharge are not paid within
  twenty days after the date the vehicle owner receives the
  assessment notice specified in subparagraph (I) of this paragraph
  (e), the peace officer who issued the original penalty assessment
  notice shall file a complaint with a court having jurisdiction
  and issue and serve upon the registered owner of the vehicle a
  summons to appear in court at the time and place
  specified.</M></P>
  <P N="(6)(f)(I)">(f)
  <N></N>(I)
  <M>The entering court shall send certification of the entry of
  judgment for each violation of paragraph (b), (c), or (d) of
  subsection (3) of this section to the department.</M></P>
  <P N="(6)(f)(II)">(II)
  <M>Upon receipt of certification of an entry of judgment for a
  violation of paragraph (b), (c), or (d) of subsection (3) of this
  section, the department shall not register the person's vehicle
  until all fines imposed for the violations have been
  paid.</M></P>
  <P N="(6)(f)(III)">(III)
  <M>Upon receipt of certification or independent verification of
  an entry of judgment, the department shall revoke an identifying
  plate or placard as provided in section 42-3-204 (7)(d).</M></P>
  <P N="(6)(g)(I)">(g)
  <N></N>(I)
  <M>Notwithstanding any other provision of this section to the
  contrary, a holder is liable for any penalty or fine as set forth
  in this section or section 42-3-204 or for any misuse of an
  identifying plate or placard, including the use of such plate or
  placard by any person other than a holder, unless the holder
  furnishes sufficient evidence that the identifying plate or
  placard was, at the time of the violation, in the care, custody,
  or control of another person without the holder's knowledge or
  consent.</M></P>
  <P N="(6)(g)(II)">(II)
  <M>A holder may avoid the liability described in subparagraph (I)
  of this paragraph (g) if, within a reasonable time after
  notification of the violation, the holder furnishes to the
  prosecutorial division of the appropriate jurisdiction the name
  and address of the person who had the care, custody, or control
  of the identifying plate or placard at the time of the violation
  or the holder reports the license plate or placard lost or stolen
  to both the appropriate local law enforcement agency and the
  department.</M></P>
  <P N="(6)(h)">(h)
  <N></N>An employer shall not forbid an employee from reporting
  violations of this section. A person shall not initiate or
  administer any disciplinary action against an employee because
  the employee notified the authorities of a possible violation of
  this section if the employee has a good-faith belief that a
  violation has occurred.</P>
  <P N="(6)(i)">(i)
  <M>A landlord shall not retaliate against a tenant because the
  tenant notified the authorities of a possible violation of this
  section if the tenant has a good-faith belief that a violation
  has occurred.</M></P>
  <P N="(6)(j)">(j)
  <M>In order to stop a vehicle from blocking access or illegally
  using reserved parking, a peace officer may order a vehicle that
  is used to violate subsection (4) of this section to be towed to
  an impound lot or a vehicle storage location. The peace officer
  shall verify that the vehicle has not been stolen and report the
  tow to the department of revenue in accordance with section
  42-4-1804.</M></P>
  <P N="(6)(k)">(k)
  <M>The state or local authority issuing a citation under this
  section, or under any local ordinance defining a substantially
  equivalent offense, shall transfer one-half of the fine to the
  state treasurer, who shall credit the fine to the disabled
  parking education and enforcement fund created in section
  42-1-226.</M></P>
  <P N="(7)(a)">(7)
  <M></M>
  <B>Statewide concern.</B>(a) The general assembly finds that
  access to reserved parking by persons with disabilities ensures
  that those persons have equal access to goods and services
  essential for daily life.</P>
  <P N="(7)(b)">(b)
  <M>The general assembly determines that:</M></P>
  <P N="(7)(b)(I)">(I)
  <M>Reserved parking for persons with disabilities is a
  state-administered program and that identifying license plates
  and placards are issued under state law;</M></P>
  <P N="(7)(b)(II)">(II)
  <M>Because local regulations regarding reserved parking for
  persons with disabilities vary significantly across
  jurisdictions, they are inconsistent and confusing for persons
  with disabilities, medical professionals, peace officers, and
  members of the general public;</M></P>
  <P N="(7)(b)(III)">(III)
  <M>Modern life requires travel across multiple local
  jurisdictions. Inconsistent local marking and enforcement of
  reserved parking for persons with disabilities confuses people,
  which prevents them from fully obeying disabled parking
  regulations.</M></P>
  <P N="(7)(b)(IV)">(IV)
  <M>A message disseminated by one political subdivision of the
  state using modern communication methods will be received by
  individuals from multiple political subdivisions. Any attempt to
  use modern communication methods to educate the public on local
  regulations governing reserved parking for persons with
  disabilities will result in public exposure to multiple
  inconsistent, confusing regulations, so education requires
  uniform regulation across the state, and a statewide effort is
  needed to educate the public about disabled parking. This effort
  is funded by fines that are typically issued by local
  authorities.</M></P>
  <P N="(7)(c)">(c)
  <M>The general assembly therefore declares that access to
  reserved parking by persons with disabilities is a matter of
  statewide concern and that the provisions set forth in this
  section preempt any action contrary to this section if the action
  is adopted by a political subdivision of the
  state.</M></P></SECTION-TEXT>

  <M>Owner liability for parking violations.</M></CATCH-LINE>(1)
  <M>In addition to any other liability provided for in this
  article, the owner of a motor vehicle who is engaged in the
  business of leasing or renting motor vehicles is liable for
  payment of a parking violation fine unless the owner of the
  leased or rented motor vehicle can furnish sufficient evidence
  that the vehicle was, at the time of the parking violation, in
  the care, custody, or control of another person. To avoid
  liability for payment the owner of the motor vehicle is required,
  within a reasonable time after notification of the parking
  violation, to furnish to the prosecutorial division of the
  appropriate jurisdiction the name and address of the person or
  company who leased, rented, or otherwise had the care, custody,
  or control of such vehicle. As a condition to avoid liability for
  payment of a parking violation, any person or company who leases
  or rents motor vehicles to another person shall attach to the
  leasing or rental agreement a notice stating that, pursuant to
  the requirements of this section, the operator of the vehicle is
  liable for payment of a parking violation fine incurred when the
  operator has the care, custody, or control of the motor vehicle.
  The notice shall inform the operator that the operator's name and
  address shall be furnished to the prosecutorial division of the
  appropriate jurisdiction when a parking violation fine is

  the person's BAC, as shown by analysis of the person's breath, is
  at least 0.02 but not more than 0.05 at the time of driving or

  defendant pursuant to this subparagraph (I), may order, in
  addition to any penalty imposed under a class A traffic
  infraction, that the defendant perform up to twenty-four hours of
  useful public service, subject to the conditions and restrictions
  of section 18-1.3-507, C.R.S., and may further order that the

  <M>Notwithstanding the provisions of section 18-1-408, C.R.S.,

  alcohol.</M></P>
  <P N="(6)(a)(II)">(II)
  <M>If at such time the defendant's BAC was in excess of 0.05 but

  may also be considered with other competent evidence in
  determining whether or not the defendant was under the influence
  of alcohol.</M></P>
  <P N="(6)(a)(III)">(III)
  <M>If at such time the defendant's BAC was 0.08 or more, such

  under the influence of one or more drugs.</M></P>
  <P N="(6)(b)">(b)
  <M>The limitations of this subsection (6) shall not be construed
  as limiting the introduction, reception, or consideration of any

  from certain devices, the collection or preservation of a second

  and preservation of a delayed breath alcohol specimen is not
  required.</M></P>
  <P N="(6)(c)(II)">(II)

    <B>Annotator's note.</B>Since ยง 42-4-1301 is similar to ยง
    42-4-1301 as it existed prior to its 2002 amendment and ยง
    42-4-1202 as it existed prior to the 1994 amending of title 42
    as enacted by SB 94-1, relevant cases construing those
    provisions have been included in the annotations to this
    section.</P>
    <P>
    <B>Procedural due process violated when guilty plea to serious
    offense entered in summary proceeding.</B>In view of the
    serious consequences which follow the entry of a plea of guilty
    to driving under the influence of alcohol, the summary disposal
    immediately after arrest, notwithstanding the belief of the
    officer, evidenced by the fact that he filed the charge, that
    the accused was under the influence of liquor, constitutes a
    serious deprivation of the constitutional right of the accused
    to a fair trial. It is axiomatic that justice delayed is
    justice denied, but there are limits to the acceleration
    process, and the instant procedure was so unjustifiably sudden
    as to constitute a violation of the constitutional guarantee of
    procedural due process of law. Toland v. Strohl, 147 Colo. 577,
    364 P.2d 588 (1961).</P>
    <P>
    <B>A first-time charge of driving while ability impaired is not
    a petty offense.</B>The general assembly's placement of
    numerous alcohol and drug-related offenses in a single statute
    demonstrates an intention to not treat first-time driving while
    ability impaired offenses as petty offenses. The penalties are
    dependant upon circumstances that may not be known by the court
    at the time of arraignment. The penalties for a first-time
    offense may easily exceed those of a petty offense under
    ยง16-10-109. Therefore, defendants are not required to file with
    a court under ยง16-10-109 to obtain a trial by jury. Byrd v.
    Stavely, 113 P.3d 1273 (Colo. App. 2005).</P>
    <P>
    <B>Failure to preserve a second sample of the defendant's blood
    for independent testing did not violate his due process
    rights</B>under the state constitution because the test for
    materiality of evidence set forth in People v. Greathouse (742
    P.2d 334 (Colo. 1987)) was not met. People v. Humes, 762 P.2d
    665 (Colo. 1988).</P>
    <P>
    <B>Defendant, who was convicted of vehicular assault while
    under the influence, vehicular assault by driving recklessly,
    and driving under the influence, was not denied her right to
    procedural due process</B>by the prosecution's failure to
    preserve a second sample of her breath at the time the
    breathalyzer test was administered to her or to keep the
    victim's car in storage. Defendant failed to meet the test of
    materiality set forth in People v. Greathouse (742 P.2d 334
    (Colo. 1987)) or the test for bad faith set forth in Arizona v.
    Youngblood (488 U.S. 51 (1988)). People v. Acosta, 860 P.2d
    1376 (Colo. App. 1993).</P>
    <P>
    <B>Challenge raised initially on appeal to supreme court not
    considered.</B>An equal protection challenge to this section
    not raised during the license revocation review proceedings
    will not be considered if raised for the first time on appeal
    to the supreme court. Colgan v. State Dept. of Rev., 623 P.2d
    871 (Colo. 1981).</P>
    <P>
    <B>Subsection (6)(d) is not unconstitutional because use of
    refusal to consent to blood alcohol test as evidence of guilt
    does not violate fourth amendment right prohibiting
    unreasonable search.</B>Fitzgerald v. People, 2017 CO 26, 394
    P.3d 671; People v. King, 2017 CO 44, 401 P.3d 516; People v.
    Sewick, 2017 CO 45, 401 P.3d 521; People v. Maxwell, 2017 CO

    518.</P>
    <P>
    <B>Governmental purpose.</B>The implied consent statute serves
    the distinct governmental purpose of facilitating citizen
    cooperation in achieving traffic safety by the use of the
    administrative sanction of revocation upon a refusal to submit
    to a test, while the statutory authorization for a probationary
    license is expressly directed towards the "alcohol and drug
    traffic driving education or treatment" of the convicted
    traffic offender. DeScala v. Motor Vehicle Div., 667 P.2d 1360
    (Colo. 1983).</P>
    <P>
    <B>Legislative policy of this state</B>has been to create a
    graduated scale of penalties arising from driving an automobile
    after the use of intoxicants. Thompson v. People, 181 Colo.
    194, 510 P.2d 311 (1973).</P>
    <P>
    <B>The primary purpose of this section</B>is to obtain
    scientific evidence of the amount of alcohol in the bloodstream
    in order to curb drunk driving through prosecution for that
    offense. Zahtila v. Motor Vehicle Div., 39 Colo. App. 8, 560
    P.2d 847 (1977); Hess v. Tice, 43 Colo. App. 47, 598 P.2d 536
    (1979).</P>
    <P>This section's purpose is to assist in the prosecution of
    the drinking driver. Marin v. Colo. Dept. of Rev., 41 Colo.
    App. 557, 591 P.2d 1336 (1978).</P>
    <P>
    <B>The terms "intoxicated", "drunk", and "under the influence
    of intoxicating liquor" are substantially synonymous.</B>There
    is no reason to allow opinion testimony by a lay witness
    phrased in one of these terms and to prohibit it when it is
    phrased in another of these terms. People v. Norman, 194 Colo.
    372, 572 P.2d 819 (1977).</P>
    <P>
    <B>The terms "drive" and "drove" as used in this section and
    for purposes of the DUI statute include "actual physical
    control" of a vehicle,</B>even if the vehicle is not actually
    moving. Proof that a person is in actual physical control of a
    vehicle is sufficient to prove that the person drove the
    vehicle. People v. Swain, 959 P.2d 426 (Colo. 1998); People v.
    Valdez, 2014 COA 125, 411 P.3d 94.</P>
    <P>
    <B>Driving a motor vehicle means exercising physical control
    over a motor vehicle.</B>Although the court did not instruct
    the jury that it must find the vehicle was reasonably capable
    of being rendered operable, it did not err because there was
    undisputed testimony that the vehicle's alleged inoperability
    was a result only of a lack of fuel and a dead battery. These
    circumstances do not, as a matter of law, render a vehicle not
    reasonably capable of being rendered operable. People v.
    VanMatre, 190 P.3d 770 (Colo. App. 2008).</P>
    <P>
    <B>Prosecution not required to prove the operability of a
    vehicle beyond a reasonable doubt.</B>People v. Valdez, 2014
    COA 125, 411 P.3d 94.</P>
    <P>
    <B>Trial court did not commit plain error</B>in upholding the
    jury's separate convictions for DUI and aggravated driving
    after revocation prohibited offenses and for imposing separate
    sentences for those crimes. People v. Valdez, 2014 COA 125, 411
    P.3d 94.</P>
    <P>
    <B>For general explanation of provisions of this
    section,</B>see Marin v. Colo. Dept. of Rev., 41 Colo. App.
    557, 591 P.2d 1336 (1978).</P>
    <P>
    <B>This section is not vague, indefinite, nor uncertain</B>as
    there are reasonable ascertainable standards by which the guilt
    of an accused can be determined. Thompson v. People, 181 Colo.
    194, 510 P.2d 311 (1973).</P>
    <P>This section, when read as a whole, provides standards
    sufficiently precise to inform the defendant of the crime
    charged. Thompson v. People, 181 Colo. 194, 510 P.2d 311
    (1973).</P>
    <P>
    <B>Defendant not deprived of his constitutional right to equal
    protection under this section</B>since all class 2 misdemeanors
    do not reflect similar criminal conduct to which similar
    sanctions must be applied, the general assembly is entitled to
    establish more severe penalties for acts that it believes have
    greater social impact and graver consequences, and the
    defendant failed to prove that the mandatory sentencing scheme
    has impacted him differently from all other persons convicted
    of similar criminal conduct of driving under the influence.
    People v. Martinnillie, 940 P.2d 1090 (Colo. App. 1996).</P>
    <P>
    <B>For even a full reading of the penalty section of this
    section would not apprise the accused of the consequences of
    the guilty plea.</B>If, as the charge suggests, the accused was
    under the influence of liquor, he could not give an effectual
    waiver. The fact that the accused evidenced a desire to accept
    the impetuous proceedings tendered does not in the present
    circumstances justify the summary disposition of the charge.
    Toland v. Strohl, 147 Colo. 577, 364 P.2d 588 (1961).</P>
    <P>
    <B>It is a misdemeanor for any person under the influence of
    intoxicating liquor to drive</B>an automobile on the public
    highways. Solt v. People, 130 Colo. 1, 272 P.2d 638 (1954);
    People v. Sanchez, 173 Colo. 188, 476 P.2d 980 (1970).</P>
    <P>
    <B>Proceedings under the implied consent law are civil in
    nature.</B>Johnson v. Motor Vehicle Div., 38 Colo. App. 230,
    556 P.2d 488 (1976).</P>
    <P>
    <B>Traffic laws and revocation procedures contained in ยงยง
    42-2-122 and 42-2-203 are aimed at all drivers who</B>operate a
    motor vehicle while under the influence of alcohol or while
    their ability is impaired, regardless of their status as
    alcoholics or problem drinkers. Heninger v. Charnes, 200 Colo.
    194, 613 P.2d 884 (1980).</P>
    <P>
    <B>Subsection (1)(b) intended to be a less serious offense than
    subsection (1)(a).</B>The penalty and presumptions of this
    section clearly show a legislative intent that subsection
    (1)(b) is a less serious offense than subsection (1)(a), and
    demonstrates that the general assembly intended to establish
    two levels of prohibited conduct. Thompson v. People, 181 Colo.
    194, 510 P.2d 311 (1973).</P>
    <P>
    <B>And is a lesser included offense.</B>Driving while one's
    ability is impaired due to consumption of alcohol is considered
    a lesser included offense of driving under the influence of
    intoxicating liquor if the evidence warrants. Thompson v.
    People, 181 Colo. 194, 510 P.2d 311 (1973).</P>
    <P>
    <B>Driving under the influence is a lesser included offense of
    aggravated driving after revocation.</B>Merger principles
    preclude conviction for a lesser included offense of a crime
    for which a defendant has also been convicted in the same
    prosecution. People v. Mersman, 148 P.3d 199 (Colo. App.
    2006).</P>
    <P>
    <B>Driving under the influence is a lesser included offense of
    vehicular assault.</B>If a person is guilty of vehicular
    assault by virtue of driving under the influence, driving under
    the influence is a lesser included offense prohibited by the
    double jeopardy clause. People v. Cruthers, 124 P.3d 887 (Colo.
    App. 2005); People v. Smoots, 2013 COA 152, 396 P.3d 53, aff'd
    sub nom. Reyna-Abarca v. People, 2017 CO 15, 390 P.3d 816.</P>
    <P>
    <B>Misdemeanor offenses under this section are not the same as
    the felony offenses under ยง 18-3-205</B>because the elements
    and the required proof for conviction are different. People v.
    Smith, 182 Colo. 228, 512 P.2d 269 (1973).</P>
    <P>The misdemeanor count of driving while under the influence
    of intoxicating liquor is not the same offense as the felony
    count of inflicting bodily injury by operating an automobile in
    a reckless manner while under the influence of intoxicating
    liquor. People v. Smith, 182 Colo. 228, 512 P.2d 269
    (1973).</P>
    <P>
    <B>And are not lesser included offenses.</B>Driving under the
    influence of intoxicating liquor and driving while ability is
    impaired are not lesser included offenses of the felony charge
    of inflicting bodily injury while under the influence of
    intoxicating liquor by driving an automobile in a reckless
    manner. People v. Smith, 182 Colo. 228, 512 P.2d 269
    (1973).</P>
    <P>
    <B>Dismissal of count under this section not bar to prosecution
    under ยง 18-3-205.</B>The court's dismissal of a misdemeanor
    count under this section, which placed the defendant in
    jeopardy as to that count, did not bar prosecution on felony

    <B>Reasonable grounds to arrest driver.</B>Evidence that a
    driver's automobile was weaving across traffic lanes and
    speeding, that there was an odor of alcohol on the driver's
    breath, and that the driver did not satisfactorily perform the
    roadside sobriety tests, is sufficient to support a hearing

    pictures of his going through one test, later was admissible in
    prosecution for driving under the influence regardless of fact
    that the sound on the film had been ordered suppressed by the

    <P>A certificate generated by a breathalyzer machine is not

    <B>The failure of the arresting officer to identify which

    P.2d 665 (Colo. App. 1990).</P>
    <P>
    <B>Evidence held sufficient.</B>When the toxicologist's
    testimony is considered together with the testimony of the two
    investigating officers concerning the alcoholic odor about the
    defendant immediately after the accident and the testimony that
    defendant was driving on the wrong side of the road, the
    evidence of defendant being under the influence of intoxicating
    liquor is abundant and sustains the verdict of guilty of

    P.2d 303 (1973).</P>
    <P>

    <P>
    <B>Sufficient facts for reasonable grounds for implied consent
    test request.</B>The odor of alcohol on a driver's breath,

    <P>
    <B>Determining whether one is substantially under influence is
    jury issue.</B>Given the rebuttable presumptions, if chemical
    analysis of a defendant's blood is taken or other evidence is
    offered, juries of common experience can determine whether one
    is substantially under the influence so as to be incapable of
    operating a vehicle safely, as distinguished from merely

    <B>This section sets up a series of presumptions arising from
    the amount of alcohol in the blood.</B>Egle v. People, 159
    Colo. 217, 411 P.2d 325 (1966). 
    <P>
    <B>The limitations of this section shall not prevent the
    consideration of any other competent evidence</B>that defendant
    was under the influence of intoxicating liquor. Egle v. People,
    159 Colo. 217, 411 P.2d 325 (1966).</P>
    <P>
    <B>Subsection (2) authorizes only a permissive inference that
    defendant was under the influence of alcohol.</B>Because of the
    constitutional conflicts which arise with the use of
    presumptions in criminal cases and because of the central
    purposes behind the legislature's enactment of the presumption,
    subsection (2)(c) is properly construed to authorize only a
    permissive inference that the defendant was under the influence
    of alcohol. Barnes v. People, 735 P.2d 869 (Colo. 1987).</P>
    <P>Instruction which told jurors that they "must accept the
    presumption as if it had been factually established by the
    evidence" and that they could reject this presumption only if
    it was "rebutted by evidence to the contrary" created a
    mandatory and not a permissive presumption that the petitioner
    was under the influence of alcohol. Barnes v. People, 735 P.2d
    869 (Colo. 1987).</P>
    <P>
    <B>Both subsection (2) of this section and ยง 18-3-106 (2)
    permit a jury to infer that a defendant was under the influence
    of alcohol</B>if it finds that the amount of alcohol in his
    blood at the time of the commission of the alleged offense "or
    within a reasonable time thereafter," as shown by chemical
    analysis of the defendant's blood, is 0.10 percent or more.
    People v. Emery, 812 P.2d 665 (Colo. App. 1990).</P>
    <P>
    <B>Subsection (2)(c) is very specific in limiting the use of
    its presumption to the misdemeanors</B>of driving any vehicle
    while under the influence of intoxicating liquor and driving
    while ability is impaired by the consumption of alcohol. People
    v. Davis, 187 Colo. 16, 528 P.2d 251 (1974).</P>
    <P>
    <B>Statutory presumption of subsection (2)(c) is not applicable
    to a felony charge</B>under ยง 18-3-106. People v. Davis, 187
    Colo. 16, 528 P.2d 251 (1974).</P>
    <P>
    <B>Defendant's ability to attack validity of
    presumption</B>that he was driving under the influence of
    alcohol when he had a blood alcohol level of .10 percent is
    dependent upon his ability to attack the accuracy of the
    machine which tested his blood alcohol level. Garcia v.
    District Court, 197 Colo. 38, 589 P.2d 924 (1979).</P>
    <P>
    <B>The blood alcohol test results are statutorily deemed to
    relate back to the alleged offense for purposes of applying the
    statutory inferences.</B>People v. Emery, 812 P.2d 665 (Colo.
    App. 1990).</P>
    <P>
    <B>Jury could infer that the defendant was under the influence
    at the time of the offense</B>where the prosecution presented
    evidence that approximately three hours after the accident,
    defendant's blood alcohol level was above the statutory
    percentage. Because the circumstances at issue permitted the
    jury to make such inference, the extrapolation evidence offered
    to establish a still higher blood alcohol level was neither
    necessary nor relevant and the admission thereof was harmless
    error. People v. Emery, 812 P.2d 665 (Colo. App. 1990).</P>
    <P>
    <B>Presumption that defendant was under influence specifically
    does not limit the introduction, reception, or consideration of
    other competent evidence</B>bearing upon the question of
    whether or not a defendant was under the influence of
    intoxicating liquor. People v. Hedrick, 192 Colo. 37, 557 P.2d
    378 (1976).</P>
    <P>
    <B>Thus, moving pictures and their sound are
    admissible.</B>Moving pictures and their sound, which are
    relevant and which allegedly show the demeanor and condition of
    a defendant charged with driving under the influence of either
    alcohol or drugs, taken at the time of the arrest or soon
    thereafter, are admissible in evidence even though they show
    the defendant's refusal to take sobriety and coordination
    tests, when properly offered in order to show the defendant's
    demeanor, conduct and appearance, and to show why sobriety and
    coordination tests were not given. Lanford v. People, 159 Colo.
    36, 409 P.2d 829 (1966).</P>
    <P>
    <B>Even if a defendant objects to the introduction and
    admission of movies,</B>they still are to be admitted, provided
    that then the trial court must, at defendant's request, caution
    the jury as to the limited purpose of the evidence, and again
    at defendant's request, give a limiting instruction in the
    general charge for the same purpose. Lanford v. People, 159
    Colo. 36, 409 P.2d 829 (1966).</P>
    <P>
    <B>Evidence of breath analysis results indicating a level of
    0.139 grams of alcohol per 210 liters of breath and testimony
    of both lay witness and law enforcement agents that defendant
    was driving erratically before the collision and that she
    exhibited some symptoms of being under the influence after the
    collision was sufficient</B>to establish that, at the time of
    the collision, defendant's physical or mental capacities had
    been adversely affected by her previous consumption of alcohol.
    People v. Acosta, 860 P.2d 1376 (Colo. App. 1993).</P>
    <P>
    <B>Jury verdict convicting defendant of driving under the
    influence and vehicular assault while under the influence is
    not inconsistent with</B>defendant's acquittal of driving with
    an excessive blood or breath alcohol content since the jury
    could well have rejected the reliability of breath tests
    indicating a level of 0.139 grams of alcohol per 210 liters of
    breath to show beyond a reasonable doubt an excessive level of
    alcohol in defendant's breath but could have concluded that her
    mental and physical capacities had been so affected that she
    had been under the influence given her admission that she had
    consumed at least one and one-half glasses of wine. People v.
    Acosta, 860 P.2d 1376 (Colo. App. 1993).</P></ANNO-TEXT>

    <P>
    <B>Subsections (1) and (4) of this section do not create two
    separate offenses.</B>The obvious purpose of these statutory
    provisions is to regulate the punishment to be imposed upon the
    single offense of drunk driving. Righi v. People, 145 Colo.
    457, 359 P.2d 656 (1961); Quintana v. People, 169 Colo. 295,

    <P>
    <B>A prior conviction is an element of felony DUI.</B>The
    statutory provisions that define and provide penalties for
    felony DUI make prior convictions an element of the crime, and,
    therefore, the prior convictions must be proved to the jury
    beyond a reasonable doubt. Linnebur v. People, 2020 CO 79M, 476
    P.3d 734; People v. Carter, 2021 COA 29, 486 P.3d 473; People
    v. Tun, 2021 COA 34, 486 P.3d 490; People v. Ambrose, 2021 COA
    62, -- P.3d --.</P>
    <P>
    <B>The plain language of subsection (1) compels the conclusion
    that the general assembly intended prior DUI or DWAI offenses
    to constitute elements of felony DUI that do more than increase
    the penalty</B>of the crime. Therefore, to obtain a conviction,
    a prosecutor must prove prior convictions to a jury beyond a
    reasonable doubt. Transforming a misdemeanor into a felony does
    far more than simply increase the potential punishment; it
    changes the very nature of the offense because felony trials
    have important procedural distinctions and collateral
    consequences that misdemeanor cases do not. People v. Viburg,
    2020 COA 8M, 477 P.3d 746.</P>
    <P>
    <B>Subsection (4) only intended to increase punishment for
    substantive offense.</B>The guilt of a substantive offense and
    the proof of prior convictions are clearly severable. Proof of
    prior convictions or the adjudication that the defendant is an
    habitual criminal do not involve substantive offenses, but
    merely provide for increased punishment of those whose prior
    convictions fall within the scope of these statutes. The
    important relation between the primary offenses and the prior
    convictions charged is, therefore, the sentence to be imposed,
    and the jury does not participate in that. Righi v. People, 145
    Colo. 457, 359 P.2d 656 (1961); Quintana v. People, 169 Colo.
    295, 455 P.2d 210 (1969).</P>
    <P>
    <B>Former convictions must be in separate counts of the
    information,</B>and then it appears to be the accepted practice
    that when arraignment is had, the defendant be fully advised of
    these counts in the information. Heinze v. People, 127 Colo.
    54, 253 P.2d 596 (1953); Quintana v. People, 169 Colo. 295, 455
    P.2d 210 (1969).</P>
    <P>
    <B>The use of the proof of convictions of second or more
    offenses cannot obtain until guilt of the substantive offense
    on trial is established.</B>Heinze v. People, 127 Colo. 54, 253
    P.2d 596 (1953); Quintana v. People, 169 Colo. 295, 455 P.2d
    210 (1969).</P>
    <P>
    <B>The same jury need not be utilized in both segments in the
    prosecution of a drunk driving charge aggravated by a charge of
    a prior conviction</B>within five years. Quintana v. People,
    169 Colo. 295, 455 P.2d 210 (1969).</P>
    <P>
    <B>However, proof may be offered to the same jury if a guilty
    verdict has been returned on the substantive count.</B>Heinze
    v. People, 127 Colo. 54, 253 P.2d 596 (1953).</P>
    <P>
    <B>Abuse of discretion to set aside guilty verdict on
    substantive offense and order another trial on second count of
    prior conviction.</B>Quintana v. People, 169 Colo. 295, 455
    P.2d 210 (1969).</P>
    <P>
    <B>When the sole question on remand from an appellate court
    involves the proof of an alleged prior conviction,</B>there is
    no reason to require the parties to retry the question of guilt
    of the primary offenses when the correctness of that
    determination is not challenged. There is nothing prejudicial
    involved in a limited new trial on the issue of the challenged
    prior conviction by a jury different from that which tried the
    issue of guilt of the primary offenses. Quintana v. People, 169
    Colo. 295, 455 P.2d 210 (1969).</P></ANNO-TEXT>

    <B>Annotator's note.</B>The annotations below resulted from
    cases involving the implied consent law, which was replaced by
    the express consent law in 1983, and have been included for
    historical purposes. 
    <P>
    <B>This section was known as the "implied consent
    law".</B>Colo. Dept. of Rev. v. District Court ex rel. County
    of Adams, 172 Colo. 144, 470 P.2d 864 (1970).</P>
    <P>
    <B>The implied consent law is constitutional.</B>People v.
    Brown, 174 Colo. 513, 485 P.2d 500 (1971), appeal dismissed,
    404 U.S. 1007, 92 S. Ct. 671, 301 L. Ed. 2d (1972); Sweeney v.
    State Dept. of Rev., 185 Colo. 116, 522 P.2d 101 (1974).</P>
    <P>This section is not unconstitutional as violative of equal
    protection. Norsworthy v. Colo. Dept. of Rev., 197 Colo. 527,
    594 P.2d 1055 (1979).</P>
    <P>The statutory scheme militates against a standardless
    discretion in enforcement and does not violate equal protection
    of the laws. Davis v. Colo. Dept. of Rev., 623 P.2d 874 (Colo.
    1981).</P>
    <P>The federal constitution does not prohibit the states from
    requiring a driver to submit to chemical testing of his blood
    shortly after a valid arrest. People v. Gillett, 629 P.2d 613
    (Colo. 1981).</P>
    <P>This section does not violate constitutional standards
    because the statute does not expressly require an evidentiary
    hearing on the issue of any alleged refusal to submit to some
    form of test to determine the alcohol content of a driver's
    breath or blood. The statutory requirement of a specific
    averment by the arresting officer that the driver refused to
    submit to an appropriate chemical analysis test makes the issue
    of refusal a question of fact, permitting the driver to present
    evidence contrary to such an averment and requiring the hearing
    officer to make a finding on such a factual issue based on all
    of the evidence. DuPuis v. Charnes, 668 P.2d 1 (Colo.
    1983).</P>
    <P>The failure of the implied consent statute to provide for a
    probationary license does not violate equal protection of the
    laws. DeScala v. Motor Vehicle Div., 667 P.2d 1360 (Colo.
    1983).</P>
    <P>
    <B>The implied consent law met the constitutional requirements
    of due process.</B>People v. Brown, 174 Colo. 513, 485 P.2d 500
    (1971), appeal dismissed, 404 U.S. 1007, 92 S. Ct. 671, 301 L.
    Ed. 2d 656 (1972).</P>
    <P>
    <B>Probable cause is required before test may be
    administered.</B>People v. Grassi, 192 P.3d 496 (Colo. App.
    2008), aff'd, 2014 CO 12, 320 P.3d 332, cert. denied, 574 U.S.
    1014, 135 S. Ct. 678, 190 L. Ed.2d 393 (2014).</P>
    <P>
    <B>Probable cause may be established under the fellow-officer
    rule if two conditions are met:</B>(1) The officer acts
    pursuant to a coordinated investigation, and (2) the police, as
    a whole, possess the information giving rise to probable cause
    at the time of the search or arrest. Grassi v. People, 2014 CO
    12, 320 P.3d 332, cert. denied, 574 U.S. 1014, 135 S. Ct. 678,
    190 L. Ed.2d 393 (2014).</P>
    <P>
    <B>The implied consent law gave rights which were greater than
    those required by due process.</B>It specifically provided that
    at the time of the request to take the test, the officer shall
    inform the licensee orally and in writing "of his rights under
    the law and the probable consequences of refusal to submit to
    such a test". Vigil v. Motor Vehicle Div., 184 Colo. 142, 519
    P.2d 332 (1974).</P>
    <P>
    <B>Reason implied consent statute enacted.</B>The implied
    consent statute was enacted to assist in the prosecution of the
    drinking driver. Calvert v. State Dept. of Rev., 184 Colo. 214,
    519 P.2d 341 (1974); People v. Carlson, 677 P.2d 310 (Colo.
    1984).</P>
    <P>The implied consent law was enacted to assist law
    enforcement officers in prosecuting the drinking driver.
    Zahtila v. Motor Vehicle Div., 39 Colo. App. 8, 560 P.2d 847
    (1977).</P>
    <P>
    <B>Purpose of revocation penalty.</B>To encourage the suspected
    drunk driver to take a blood-alcohol test voluntarily, the
    implied consent statute imposed an automatic revocation
    penalty, with very few exceptions, on those who refused to take
    the test. Calvert v. State Dept. of Rev., 184 Colo. 214, 519
    P.2d 341 (1974).</P>
    <P>
    <B>Written notice required.</B>Former subsection (3)(b)
    required that the "person arrested" be given an explanation, in
    written form, of his rights and the probable consequences of
    refusing to submit to a test, in order that he may read and
    study the same before having to make a decision. Cantrell v.
    Weed, 35 Colo. App. 180, 530 P.2d 986 (1974); Cooper v.
    Nielson, 687 P.2d 541 (Colo. App. 1984) (decided under
    subsection (3) prior to 1983 repeal and reenactment).</P>
    <P>
    <B>Such notice must be physically offered to licensee at time
    of test.</B>Under former subsection (3)(b) notice in writing
    had to be physically handed or offered to the licensee
    contemporaneously with or prior to the officer's request for
    the sobriety test. Cantrell v. Weed, 35 Colo. App. 180, 530
    P.2d 986 (1974).</P>
    <P>Merely affording driver the opportunity to "read along"
    while the officer orally recited the form containing written
    notice of the consequences of refusal to submit to test was not
    sufficient to constitute written notice under former subsection
    (3)(b). Cantrell v. Weed, 35 Colo. App. 180, 530 P.2d 986
    (1974).</P>
    <P>Where the arresting officer testified unequivocally that he
    read the advisement form to the plaintiff and offered him the
    opportunity to read it for himself, but that the plaintiff
    refused to do so, the evidence was sufficient to support a
    hearing examiner's finding that the plaintiff was properly
    advised under former subsection (3)(b). Gilbert v. Dolan, 41
    Colo. App. 173, 586 P.2d 233 (1978).</P>
    <P>
    <B>How warning should be phrased.</B>The warning under former
    subsection (3)(b) had to be phrased so that a person of normal
    intelligence would understand the consequences of his actions.
    Calvert v. State Dept. of Rev., 184 Colo. 214, 519 P.2d 341
    (1974).</P>
    <P>
    <B>What licensee to be informed of.</B>The implied consent law
    required that the licensee be informed of both the hearing and
    the possibility of the revocation of the license. Vigil v.
    Motor Vehicle Div., 184 Colo. 142, 519 P.2d 332 (1974).</P>
    <P>A licensee was advised of the "probable consequences of
    refusal" under former subsection (3)(b) if he was informed that
    his license "might" be revoked. Hall v. Charnes, 42 Colo. App.
    111, 590 P.2d 516 (1979).</P>
    <P>Where the motorist was given the Miranda v. Arizona, 384
    U.S. 436, 86 S. Ct. 1602, 16 L. Ed. 2d 694, 10 A.L.R.3d 974
    (1966) warnings and he manifested his desire to call his
    attorney before deciding whether or not to submit to the test,
    but was not told that he had no such right, under these
    circumstances, the motorist should have been advised that the
    right to remain silent does not include the right to refuse to
    submit to the test or the right to prior consultation with an
    attorney. Calvert v. State Dept. of Rev., 184 Colo. 214, 519
    P.2d 341 (1974).</P>
    <P>
    <B>The fact that the defendant was handcuffed and could neither
    touch nor feel the implied consent form</B>when it was read to
    him was of no consequence where it was placed in such a
    position that he could, if he so desired, read it, and he was
    given the form as soon as practicable when his handcuffs were
    removed. Herren v. Motor Vehicle Div., 39 Colo. App. 146, 565
    P.2d 955 (1977).</P>
    <P>
    <B>Officer was not required to orally advise a driver</B>of his
    rights prior to a second request to submit to a blood alcohol
    test which was accompanied by a written advisement of the
    driver's rights. Bowker v. Charnes, 679 P.2d 1119 (Colo. App.
    1984).</P>
    <P>
    <B>Notice requirements of former subsection (3)(b) were not
    violated</B>by the fact that the advisement form read by an
    arresting officer to one stopped for suspicion of driving while
    intoxicated did not state that an individual could refuse to
    submit to a test if it would be medically inadvisable for him
    to do so or if the test to be given would not conform to the
    rules and regulations prescribed by the state board of health.
    Zinn v. Dolan, 41 Colo. App. 370, 588 P.2d 389 (1978).</P>
    <P>
    <B>The only valid justifications in the implied consent law for
    refusing the test</B>are either that it was medically
    inadvisable for the licensee or that the test would not be
    given in compliance with proper health standards. Vigil v.
    Motor Vehicle Div., 184 Colo. 142, 519 P.2d 332 (1974).</P>
    <P>
    <B>The implied consent law applied only to the misdemeanor
    offense of driving under the influence</B>of intoxicating
    liquor as defined in this section. People v. Sanchez, 173 Colo.
    188, 476 P.2d 980 (1970).</P>
    <P>The consent provision of this section applied only to
    misdemeanor offenses and not to felonies. People v. Acosta, 620
    P.2d 55 (Colo. App. 1980).</P>
    <P>
    <B>One charged with felony could not claim consent to test was
    statutorily or constitutionally required.</B>Inasmuch as this
    section did not extend to felonies, a defendant charged with
    the felony of causing injury while driving under the influence
    of intoxicating liquor could not claim any statutory right to
    refuse to take a breathalyzer test. Since consent was neither
    statutorily nor constitutionally required, it was immaterial
    whether such defendant was inadequately advised or whether his
    consent was uninformed. People v. Sanchez, 173 Colo. 188, 476
    P.2d 980 (1970).</P>
    <P>
    <B>One could not be compelled to take a roadside sobriety
    test</B>against one's wishes. People v. Helm, 633 P.2d 1071
    (Colo. 1981).</P>
    <P>
    <B>Other jurisdictions, with similar implied consent laws, have
    unanimously found their statutes to be merely permissive</B>and
    not mandatory. People v. Culp, 189 Colo. 76, 537 P.2d 746

    <P>
    <B>State's exercise of police power.</B>An individual's right
    to use the public highways of this state is an adjunct of the
    constitutional right to acquire, possess, and protect property,
    yet such a right may be limited by a proper exercise of the
    police power of the state based upon a reasonable relationship
    to the public health, safety, and welfare. People v. Brown, 174
    Colo. 513, 485 P.2d 500 (1971), appeal dismissed, 404 U.S.
    1007, 92 S. Ct. 671, 301 L. Ed. 2d 656 (1972).</P>

    <B>There is no constitutional right to refuse to surrender

    656 (1972).</P>
    <P>
    <B>This section does not violate equal protection.</B>A
    rational basis exists for the statute's differential treatment
    of individuals who receive medical treatment at locations
    without breath testing equipment because providing such
    individuals with the option of choosing a breath test would
    cause delays in obtaining test samples. These delays would
    substantially hinder the state's legitimate public safety
    interest in securing timely alcohol test results for
    individuals suspected of driving while intoxicated. Evans v.
    Dept. of Rev., 159 P.3d 769 (Colo. App. 2006).</P>
    <P>
    <B>This section is not unconstitutionally vague.</B>The words
    and phrases of this section are readily comprehensible to
    persons of ordinary intelligence without further definition.
    The statute, in sufficiently clear terms, provides individuals
    with fair warning as to the circumstances under which a choice
    of tests is, and is not, available. Evans v. Dept. of Rev., 159
    P.3d 769 (Colo. App. 2006).</P>
    <P>
    <B>The right to refuse a blood test under the implied consent
    (now express consent) law is a statutory right only</B>and as
    such is subject to the sanction of possible suspension of one's
    driver's license. People v. Brown, 174 Colo. 513, 485 P.2d 500
    (1971), appeal dismissed, 404 U.S. 1007, 92 S. Ct. 671, 301 L.
    Ed. 2d 656 (1972); Fitzgerald v. People, 2017 CO 26, 394 P.3d

    518.</P>
    <P>
    <B>Right to refuse.</B>Statutory, not constitutional, law
    provides the basis for determining whether there is any
    requirement that a motorist alleged to have violated drunk
    driving statute must be advised of right to refuse or to choose
    a type of blood alcohol test. Moreover, no such statutorily
    required advisement exists. Brewer v. Motor Vehicle Div., Dept.
    of Rev., 720 P.2d 564 (Colo. 1986); Smith v. Charnes, 728 P.2d
    1287 (Colo. 1986); Evans v. Dept. of Rev., 159 P.3d 769 (Colo.
    App. 2006).</P>
    <P>
    <B>Miranda warnings are not required</B>before the
    administration of a roadside sobriety test. People v. Helm, 633
    P.2d 1071 (Colo. 1981); People v. Lowe, 687 P.2d 454 (Colo.
    1984).</P>
    <P>
    <B>Use of refusal to consent to blood alcohol test as evidence
    of guilt does not violate fourth amendment right prohibiting
    unreasonable search.</B>Defendant argued that use of
    refusal-to-consent evidence penalized the exercise of a
    defendant's right to refuse consent. Refusal to consent to
    testing is a statutory right under the express consent statute.
    While criminalizing a refusal to consent would be improper, use
    of refusal to consent as evidence of guilt and automatic
    suspension of driving privileges for refusal would not
    impermissibly burden a defendant's fourth amendment
    constitutional right to be free from a warrantless search.
    Fitzgerald v. People, 2017 CO 26, 394 P.3d 671; People v. King,

    <B>A motorist does not have a constitutional right to talk with

    Calvert v. State Dept. of Rev., 184 Colo. 214, 519 P.2d 341
    (1974).</P>
    <P>Driver was not prejudiced by the failure of arresting
    officer to warn him that he had no right to counsel under this
    statute. Sauer v. Heckers, 34 Colo. App. 217, 524 P.2d 1387
    (1974).</P>
    <P>There was no duty to advise defendant that he had no right
    to counsel prior to deciding whether to permit a chemical test
    of his blood where he was given an opportunity to make a phone
    call and despite defendant's confusion between his fifth
    amendment rights to counsel and his rights under the implied
    consent law. Washington v. Dolan, 38 Colo. App. 414, 557 P.2d
    1223 (1976).</P>
    <P>A motorist has no right under the Colorado implied consent

    <B>Statutory consent satisfies consent exception to fourth

    document purporting to identify person who drew defendant's
    blood for blood test was not itself verified, and where no
    testimony was presented which identified that person as one

    <P>
    <B>The two-hour standard does not apply to a refusal to take a

    <P>
    <B>But licensee must inform officer of reconsideration and
    consent.</B>Although an attorney informs a police officer that
    she has advised her client to submit to a blood-alcohol test,
    unless the licensee informs the officer of his consent to the
    test, a prior refusal to take the test is grounds for the
    revocation of his license. McCampbell v. Charnes, 626 P.2d 762

    <P>After a driver has refused to submit to a test, recantation
    must be made to the arresting officer or other law enforcement
    officer in sufficient time to obtain a sample within two hours
    of the person's driving. The arresting officer is not obliged
    to wait with the suspect for two hours in case the suspect may
    wish to recant the refusal. If the officer has returned to
    duty, the refusal stands. Gallion v. Colo. Dept. of Rev., 155

  <P N="(3)(c)(III)">(III)
  <M>The alcohol evaluation shall be conducted and the report

  education or treatment programs approved by the behavioral health
  administration in the department of human services. Level I
  programs are short-term, didactic education programs. Level II
  programs are therapeutically oriented education, long-term
  outpatient, and comprehensive residential programs. The court
  shall instruct a defendant sentenced to level I or level II
  programs to meet all financial obligations of the programs. If
  the financial obligations are not met, the program shall notify
  the sentencing court for the purpose of collection or review and
  further action on the defendant's sentence. Nothing in this

  <N></N>(a)
  <M>There is created an alcohol and drug driving safety program
  fund in the office of the state treasurer, referred to in this
  subsection (4) as the "fund". The fund consists of money
  deposited in it as directed by this subsection (4)(a). The
  assessment in effect on July 1, 1998, remains in effect unless
  the judicial department and the behavioral health administration
  in the department of human services have provided the general
  assembly with a statement of the cost of the program, including
  costs of administration for the past and current fiscal year to
  include a proposed change in the assessment. The general assembly
  shall then consider the proposed new assessment and approve the
  amount to be assessed against each person during the following
  fiscal year in order to ensure that the alcohol and drug driving
  safety program established in this section is financially
  self-supporting. Any adjustment in the amount to be assessed must
  be noted in the appropriation to the judicial department and the
  behavioral health administration in the department of human
  services as a footnote or line item related to this program in
  the general appropriation bill. The state auditor shall
  periodically audit the costs of the programs to determine that
  they are reasonable and that the rate charged is accurate based
  on these costs. Any other fines, fees, or costs levied against a
  person are not part of the program fund. The court shall transmit
  to the state treasurer the amount assessed for the alcohol and
  drug evaluation to be credited to the fund. Fees charged pursuant
  to section 27-81-106 (1) to approved alcohol and drug treatment
  facilities that provide level I and level II programs as provided
  in subsection (3)(c) of this section must be transmitted to the
  state treasurer, who shall credit the fees to the fund. Upon
  appropriation by the general assembly, the money must be expended
  by the judicial department and the behavioral health
  administration in the department of human services for the
  administration of the alcohol and drug driving safety program. In
  administering the alcohol and drug driving safety program, the
  judicial department is authorized to contract with any agency for
  any services the judicial department deems necessary. Money
  deposited in the fund remains in the fund to be used for the
  purposes set forth in this section and must not revert or
  transfer to the general fund except by further act of the general
  assembly.</M></P>
  <P N="(4)(b)">(b)
  <M>The judicial department shall ensure that qualified personnel
  are placed in the judicial districts. The judicial department and
  the behavioral health administration in the department of human
  services shall jointly develop and maintain criteria for
  evaluation techniques, treatment referral, data reporting, and
  program evaluation.</M></P>
  <P N="(4)(c)">(c)
  <M>The alcohol and drug driving safety program shall cooperate in
  providing services to a defendant who resides in a judicial
  district other than the one in which the arrest was made. Alcohol
  and drug driving safety programs may cooperate in providing
  services to any defendant who resides at a location closer to
  another judicial district's program. The requirements of this
  section shall not apply to persons who are not residents of
  Colorado at the time of sentencing.</M></P>
  <P N="(4)(d)">(d)
  <M>Notwithstanding any provision of paragraph (a) of this
  subsection (4) to the contrary, on March 5, 2003, the state
  treasurer shall deduct one million dollars from the alcohol and
  drug driving safety program fund and transfer such sum to the
  general fund.</M></P>
  <P N="(5)">(5)
  <M>The provisions of this section are also applicable to any
  defendant who receives a diversion in accordance with section
  18-1.3-101, C.R.S., or who receives a deferred sentence in
  accordance with section 18-1.3-102, C.R.S., and the completion of
  any stipulated alcohol evaluation, level I or level II education
  program, or level I or level II treatment program to be completed
  by the defendant shall be ordered by the court in accordance with
  the conditions of such deferred prosecution or deferred sentence
  as stipulated to by the prosecution and the defendant.</M></P>
  <P N="(6)">(6)
  <M>An approved alcohol or drug treatment facility that provides
  level I or level II programs as provided in paragraph (c) of
  subsection (3) of this section shall not require a person to
  repeat any portion of an alcohol and drug driving safety
  education or treatment program that he or she has successfully
  completed while he or she was imprisoned for the current
  offense.</M></P></SECTION-TEXT>

  imprisonment as a penalty for a violation of a condition of his
  or her probation, the penalty shall constitute a separate period

    <B>A finding of knowing or wilful conduct is sufficient</B>to

    Yanaga, 635 P.2d 925 (Colo. App. 1981).</P>
    <P>
    <B>One may be said to be guilty of wanton behavior
    when,</B>although the defendant may not have deliberately
    intended to injure anyone, he consciously chooses a dangerous
    course of action which to a reasonable mind creates a strong
    probability that injury to others will result. Martin v.
    People, 179 Colo. 237, 499 P.2d 606 (1972).</P>
    <P>
    <B>Wanton and wilful disregard not equivalent of wilful or
    intentional injury.</B>An allegation in a complaint that
    defendant was guilty of negligence consisting of wanton and
    wilful disregard of the rights and safety of others is not
    equivalent to an allegation of wilful or intentional injury.
    Healy v. Hewitt, 101 Colo. 92, 71 P.2d 63 (1937).</P>
    <P>
    <B>One who commits reckless driving necessarily has been guilty
    of careless driving,</B>for the greater degree of negligence
    includes the lesser. People v. Chapman, 192 Colo. 322, 557 P.2d
    1211 (1977).</P>
    <P>Both reckless and careless driving offenses consist of two
    elements: (1) The act of driving a motor vehicle; and (2) the
    state of mind in "disregard" of or "without due regard" for
    safety. People v. Chapman, 192 Colo. 322, 557 P.2d 1211
    (1977).</P>
    <P>In both reckless and careless driving statutes the essence
    of the mental element is disregard of safety in driving. In
    both it is the absence of care which renders the driving
    criminal. People v. Chapman, 192 Colo. 322, 557 P.2d 1211
    (1977).</P>
    <P>The two offenses differ only in that the degree of
    negligence required is far more culpable in reckless driving
    than in careless driving, although it falls short of
    intentional wrongdoing. People v. Chapman, 192 Colo. 322, 557
    P.2d 1211 (1977).</P>

    <B>Reckless driving is a lesser included offense of vehicular

    People v. Esparza-Treto, 282 P.3d 471 (Colo. App. 2011).</P>
    <P>"Wanton or willful disregard" for safety under this section
    is essentially the same element as the "reckless" state of mind
    specified in ยง18-9-116.5. People v. Pena, 962 P.2d 285 (Colo.
    App. 1997).</P>
    <P>
    <B>Reckless driving is not a lesser included offense
    of</B>vehicular homicide or vehicular assault. People v. Clary,
    950 P.2d 654 (Colo. App. 1997).</P>
    <P>
    <B>Jury question in civil case.</B>Whether or not either of the
    drivers or both were negligent in violating this section and
    whether said negligence was the proximate cause of this
    accident, or whether it was caused by the joint and concurrent
    negligence of both, were questions of fact for the jury to
    determine. Amos v. Remington Arms Co., 117 Colo. 399, 188 P.2d

    <B>Annotator's note.</B>Since ยง 42-4-1402 is similar to ยง
    42-4-1204 as it existed prior to the 1994 amendments to title
    42 as enacted by SB 94-1, relevant cases construing that
    provision have been included with the annotations to this
    section.</P>
    <P>
    <B>This section is applicable and may be enforced in connection
    with acts of careless driving committed on private
    property</B>used as a shopping center parking lot. Clark v.
    Bunnell, 172 Colo. 32, 470 P.2d 42 (1970); People v. Millican,
    172 Colo. 561, 474 P.2d 789 (1970); People v. Erb, 173 Colo.
    15, 475 P.2d 330 (1970).</P>
    <P>
    <B>This section preempts ordinance.</B>In prosecution for
    violation of traffic ordinance, where this section makes
    complete provision for the offenses involved, leaving nothing
    to supplement, the ordinance must fall, the state having
    preempted the field. City of Aurora v. Mitchell, 144 Colo. 526,
    357 P.2d 923 (1960).</P>
    <P>
    <B>One who commits reckless driving necessarily has been guilty
    of careless driving,</B>for the greater degree of negligence
    includes the lesser. People v. Chapman, 192 Colo. 322, 557 P.2d
    1211 (1977).</P>
    <P>Both reckless and careless driving offenses consist of two
    elements: (1) The act of driving a motor vehicle; and (2) the
    state of mind in "disregard" of or "without due regard" for
    safety. People v. Chapman, 192 Colo. 322, 557 P.2d 1211
    (1977).</P>
    <P>In both reckless and careless driving statutes, the essence
    of the mental element is disregard of safety in driving. In
    both it is the absence of care which renders the driving
    criminal. People v. Chapman, 192 Colo. 322, 557 P.2d 1211
    (1977).</P>
    <P>The two offenses differ only in that the degree of
    negligence required is far more culpable in reckless driving
    than in careless driving, although it falls short of
    intentional wrongdoing. People v. Chapman, 192 Colo. 322, 557
    P.2d 1211 (1977).</P>
    <P>The actions of a defendant convicted of criminally negligent
    homicide may be the same as a person convicted under this
    section. The enactment by the general assembly of a specific
    criminal statute does not preclude prosecution under a general
    criminal statute unless a legislative intent to limit
    prosecution to the specific statute is shown. Here no such
    intent is found. People v. Tow, 992 P.2d 665 (Colo. App.
    1999).</P>
    <P>
    <B>Careless driving is not a lesser included offense of
    vehicular assault (reckless).</B>People v. Zweygardt, 2012 COA
    119, 298 P.3d 1018.</P>
    <P>
    <B>A child who is in utero at the time of the careless driving
    offense</B>who is subsequently born alive and dies from
    injuries sustained due to the offense can be a victim by virtue
    of the plain meaning of the statute. People v. Lage, 232 P.3d
    138 (Colo. App. 2009).</P>
    <P>
    <B>Relationship of this section to probationary license
    regulation.</B>Since the language of a department of revenue
    regulation concerning careless driving as an aggravating factor
    in the denial of a probationary license tracks the language of
    this section, a conviction under this section necessarily
    qualifies as an aggravating factor under the regulation.

    coverage and subjected the vendee to personal liability and

    <B>It is not the prosecution's burden to prove,</B>as an
    element of the offense, that an officer requested proof of
    insurance before an offender may be convicted under subsection
    (2). Rather, the prosecution's burden is to prove beyond a
    reasonable doubt that the offender was driving and that he or
    she had no insurance. People v. Martinez, 179 P.3d 23 (Colo.
    App. 2007).</P>
    <P>Because subsection (6) enacts a safeguard to protect drivers
    who have insurance but who are unable to produce evidence of it
    when stopped by an officer, and since the defendant never
    asserted or suggested during trial that he had insurance, the
    evidence was sufficient to support the conclusion that
    defendant was guilty under subsection (2). People v. Martinez,
    179 P.3d 23 (Colo. App. 2007).</P>
    <P>
    <B>Even though peace officer did not explicitly ask for proof
    of insurance, there was prima facie evidence of lack of
    insurance</B>when defendant did not produce proof of insurance
    and such documentation was not found during a search of the

    <P>
    <B>Under this section, the only circumstance in which a court

  <M>The general assembly hereby finds and declares that:</M>
  <P N="(1)(a)">(a)
  <M>The regulation of persons approaching controlled intersections
  is a matter of mixed state and local concern; and</M></P>
  <P N="(1)(b)">(b)
  <M>It is necessary, appropriate, and in the best interest of the
  state to reduce injuries, fatalities, and property damage
  resulting from collisions at controlled intersections between
  motor vehicles and persons who are not operating motor vehicles
  by allowing most persons approaching controlled intersections who
  are fifteen years of age or older or who are under fifteen years
  of age and accompanied by an adult and who are not operating
  motor vehicles to approach controlled intersections in the manner
  set forth in this section.</M></P>
  <P N="(2)(a)(I)">(2)
  <N></N>(a)
  <N></N>(I)
  <M>A pedestrian or a person who is fifteen years of age or older
  or who is under fifteen years of age and accompanied by an adult
  and who is operating a low-speed conveyance and approaching a
  controlled intersection with a stop sign shall slow down and, if
  required for safety, stop before entering the intersection. If a
  stop is not required for safety, the pedestrian or person
  operating a low-speed conveyance shall slow to a reasonable speed
  and yield the right-of-way to any traffic or pedestrian in or
  approaching the intersection. After the pedestrian or person
  operating a low-speed conveyance has slowed to a reasonable speed
  and yielded the right-of-way if required, the pedestrian or
  person operating a low-speed conveyance may cautiously make a
  turn or proceed through the intersection without
  stopping.</M></P>
  <P N="(2)(a)(II)">(II)
  <M>For purposes of this subsection (2)(a), a reasonable speed is
  ten miles per hour or less. A municipality, by ordinance, or a
  county, by resolution, may raise the maximum reasonable speed to
  twenty miles per hour if the municipality or county also posts
  signs at the intersection stating that higher speed
  limitation.</M></P>
  <P N="(2)(b)">(b)
  <M>A person who is fifteen years of age or older or who is under
  fifteen years of age and is accompanied by an adult and who is
  operating a low-speed conveyance and approaching a controlled
  intersection with an illuminated red traffic control signal shall
  stop before entering the intersection and shall yield to all
  other traffic and pedestrians. Once the person operating a
  low-speed conveyance has yielded, the person operating a
  low-speed conveyance may cautiously proceed in the same direction
  through the intersection or make a right-hand turn. When a red
  traffic control signal is illuminated, a person operating a
  low-speed conveyance shall not proceed through the intersection
  or turn right if an oncoming vehicle is turning or preparing to
  turn left in front of the person operating a low-speed
  conveyance.</M></P>
  <P N="(2)(c)">(c)
  <M>A person who is fifteen years of age or older or who is under
  fifteen years of age and is accompanied by an adult and who is
  operating a low-speed conveyance approaching an intersection of a
  roadway with an illuminated red traffic control signal may make a
  left-hand turn only if turning onto a one-way street and only
  after stopping and yielding to other traffic and pedestrians.
  However, a person operating a low-speed conveyance shall not turn
  left if an oncoming vehicle is turning or preparing to turn
  right.</M></P>
  <P N="(2)(d)">(d)
  <M>Notwithstanding any other provision of this subsection (2), if
  a county or municipality has placed a traffic sign or a traffic
  control signal at a controlled intersection and the traffic sign
  or traffic control signal provides instructions only to one or
  more specified types of low-speed conveyances, the operator of a
  low-speed conveyance to which the traffic sign or traffic control
  signal is directed shall obey the instructions provided by the
  sign or traffic control signal.</M></P>
  <P N="(2)(e)">(e)
  <M>If a county or municipality adopted a valid ordinance or
  resolution that regulates bicycles or electrical assisted
  bicycles substantially as described in subsections (2)(a.5),
  (2)(b.5), and (2)(c.5) of this section prior to May 3, 2018, that
  ordinance or resolution remains valid to the extent that it
  applies to the operation of bicycles or electrical assisted
  bicycles by persons who are under fifteen years of age and who
  are not accompanied by an adult.</M></P>
  <P N="(2.5)">(2.5)
  <M>This section supersedes any conflicting ordinance that a
  municipality, county, or city and county adopts, but nothing in
  this section affects the validity of any ordinance or resolution
  adopted by a municipality, county, or city and county that
  regulates the conduct of persons approaching controlled
  intersections and does not conflict with this section.</M></P>
  <P N="(3)">(3)
  <M>This section does not diminish or alter the authority of the
  department of transportation or the state transportation
  commission, as those entities are defined in section 43-1-102,
  regarding the department's or commission's authority to regulate
  motor vehicle traffic on any portion of the state highway system
  as defined in section 43-2-101 (1).</M></P>
  <P N="(3.5)">(3.5)
  <M>This section does not create any right for a pedestrian or the
  operator of a low-speed conveyance to travel on any portion of a
  roadway where travel is otherwise prohibited by state law or by
  an ordinance or resolution adopted by a municipality, county, or
  city and county.</M></P>

    <B>Annotator's note.</B>Since ยง 42-4-1413 is similar to ยง
    42-4-1512 as it existed prior to the 1994 amending of title 42
    as enacted by SB 94-1, relevant cases construing that provision
    have been included in the annotations to this section. 
    <P>
    <B>A defendant may be charged with multiple offenses of eluding
    a police officer arising from a single criminal episode</B>when
    he or she has performed discrete acts of eluding one or more
    police officers, each constituting a new volitional departure
    in defendant's course of conduct. People v. McMinn, 2013 COA
    94, 412 P.3d 551.</P>
    <P>
    <B>Under double jeopardy principles,</B>defendant's four
    convictions for vehicular eluding do not merge with one
    another, and defendant's four convictions for eluding a police
    officer do not merge with one another because each officer was
    eluded during separate times at separate locations. People v.
    McMinn, 2013 COA 94, 412 P.3d 551.</P>
    <P>
    <B>A construction of this statute that permits a jury to
    consider factors such as the length of time or distance driven
    does not render it unconstitutionally vague.</B>People v. Sims,
    2020 COA 78, 474 P.3d 189.</P>
    <P>
    <B>Elude may simply be defined as "avoid",</B>"escape", or "to
    not be caught". People v. Sims, 2020 COA 78, 474 P.3d 189.</P>
    <P>
    <B>Fleeing on foot is included in the phrase "any other manner"
    of eluding,</B>and the maxim ejusdem generis does not limit
    eluding to only those situations in which the operator uses the
    motor vehicle to elude the police officer, particularly given
    that ยง 18-9-116.5 criminalizes vehicular eluding while
    recklessly operating a motor vehicle. People v. Espinoza, 195
    P.3d 1122 (Colo. App. 2008).</P>
    <P>
    <B>Eluding a police officer does not require a trick or evasive
    action.</B>A court may properly convict a defendant who drives
    a motor vehicle normally but refuses to stop. People v. Sims,
    2020 COA 78, 474 P.3d 189.</P>
    <P>Although defendant did not attempt to deceive the police
    officer, the jury could reasonably conclude that defendant was
    attempting to elude the officer. People v. Sims, 2020 COA 78,
    474 P.3d 189.</P>
    <P>
    <B>Section does not require immediate compliance.</B>The
    evidence was insufficient to sustain a conviction for violating
    this section when defendant did not accelerate and drove only
    two blocks before turning into a school parking lot, driving
    over a six-inch curb, stopping, and following the officer's
    directions to get out of the vehicle. People v. Procasky, 2019
    COA 181, 467 P.3d 1252.</P>
    <P>
    <B>Crime of eluding a police officer is not a lesser included
    offense of vehicular eluding,</B>as defined in ยง 18-9-116.5.
    People v. Fury, 872 P.2d 1280 (Colo. App. 1993); People v.
    Pena, 962 P.2d 285 (Colo. App. 1997); People v. Esparza-Treto,
    282 P.3d 471 (Colo. App. 2011).</P>
    <P>
    <B>If the basis of a conviction is eluding a police officer,
    this section merges with aggravated driving with a revoked
    license.</B>Eluding a police officer is a lesser included
    offense. People v. Sims, 2020 COA 78, 474 P.3d 189.</P>

    <B>Annotator's note.</B>Since ยง 42-4-1601 is similar to ยง
    42-4-1401 as it existed prior to the 1994 amending of title 42
    as enacted by SB 94-1, relevant cases construing that provision
    have been included with the annotations to this section. 
    <P>
    <B>Sentencing under this section
    unconstitutional.</B>Sentencing a defendant under this section
    unconstitutionally denies him equal protection, because this
    section and ยง 42-4-1403 set different penalties for the same
    conduct. People v. Mumaugh, 644 P.2d 299 (Colo. 1982) (decided
    prior to 1983 repeal of ยง 42-4-1403 (3)).</P>
    <P>The distinction, if any, between "directly involved in an
    accident"(this section) and "involved in an accident" (ยง
    42-4-1403) is one without a sufficiently pragmatic difference
    to permit an intelligent and uniform application of the law.
    People v. Mumaugh, 644 P.2d 299 (Colo. 1982) (decided prior to
    1983 repeal of ยง 42-4-1403 (3)).</P>
    <P>
    <B>No violation of equal protection.</B>This section does not
    violate equal protection of the laws because the conduct
    constituting a class 4 felony under this section (i.e., leaving
    the scene of an accident resulting in death) is distinguishable
    in type and degree from the conduct constituting a class 2
    traffic offense under ยง 42-4-1406 (i.e., failing to report an
    accident). People v. Rickstrew, 775 P.2d 570 (Colo. 1989).</P>
    <P>
    <B>This section and ยง 42-4-1402 cover accidents involving
    death, injuries, and property damage.</B>City of Aurora v.
    Mitchell, 144 Colo. 526, 357 P.2d 923 (1960).</P>
    <P>
    <B>A county court has jurisdiction over the subject matter of
    offenses alleged to have been committed under this
    section.</B>People v. Griffith, 130 Colo. 475, 276 P.2d 559
    (1954).</P>
    <P>
    <B>Infractions of section are matters of general public concern
    and not purely local.</B>The investigation and apprehension of
    a violator of the requirements of this and ยง 42-4-1403 is not
    exclusively a local matter. Infractions of these provisions are
    of general public concern. Moreover, these requirements do not
    necessarily relate to traffic control, but provide certain
    necessary actions on the part of the motorist involved to be
    taken after an accident occurs to protect the life and property
    of the injured. When these offenses are charged they come under
    the general police power of the state and do not necessarily
    relate to regulation of motor vehicle traffic of a "local or
    municipal" nature, although occurring in a municipality. People
    v. Graham, 107 Colo. 202, 110 P.2d 256 (1941).</P>
    <P>
    <B>Fault and extent of damages are not issues.</B>This section
    and ยง 42-4-1403 do not contemplate that in a prosecution
    thereunder the court shall be concerned in determining where
    the fault lies. Nor may it be concerned about the extent of
    injuries to persons or damage to property resulting from an
    accident made the basis of such a prosecution. Those questions
    are referable to a prosecution under a different statute, or to
    a civil action for damages. It is not the accident, as such,
    therefore, that constitutes the offense. Weiderspon v. People,
    118 Colo. 529, 198 P.2d 301 (1948).</P>
    <P>
    <B>This section creates a strict liability offense</B>because
    the plain language does not require or imply a culpable mental
    state, the proscribed conduct does not necessarily involve a
    culpable mental state, and the fact that the offense is a
    felony is not determinative. Due process is not violated
    because the offense is against the public welfare. People v.
    Manzo, 144 P.3d 551 (Colo. 2006).</P>
    <P>
    <B>This section and ยง 42-4-1603 require a driver of a vehicle
    involved in an accident to identify himself or herself as the
    driver.</B>Unless the fact is reasonably apparent from the
    circumstances, the driver has an affirmative duty to identify
    that he or she was the one driving the motor vehicle. People v.
    Hernandez, 250 P.3d 568 (Colo. 2010).</P>
    <P>
    <B>The unit of prosecution for leaving the scene of an accident
    is the number of accident scenes, not the number of injured
    victims at those scenes;</B>consequently, where two people were
    injured at a single accident scene, defendant's conviction on
    two counts of leaving the scene of an accident violates the
    constitutional prohibition against double jeopardy. People v.
    Arzabala, 2012 COA 99, 317 P.3d 1196; People v.

    <P>
    <B>This section deals with reporting.</B>City of Aurora v.

    <P>
    <B>The conduct constituting a class 4 felony under ยง 42-4-1401
    (i.e., leaving the scene of an accident resulting in death) is
    distinguishable in type and degree</B>from the conduct
    constituting a class 2 traffic offense under this section (i.e.
    failing to report an accident); therefore, there is no
    implication of equal protection. People v. Rickstrew, 775 P.2d
    570 (Colo. 1989).</P>
    <P>
    <B>This section requires</B>that, if the accident involves
    injury, death, or property damage in excess of $100, the
    motorist file a written report with the department of revenue,
    and that law enforcement officers shall conduct an accident
    investigation and file a written report. People v. Reyes, 42

    <P>
    <B>Driver must immediately report accident and must receive
    permission to leave.</B>While this section initially grants
    authority to a driver to leave the scene of an accident, he
    must immediately report the accident to a proper authority and
    must receive specific permission from that authority before he
    is excused from any further presence at the scene of the
    accident. Gammon v. State Dept. of Rev., 32 Colo. App. 437, 513
    P.2d 748 (1973).</P>
    <P>
    <B>But where no law enforcement officer is at automobile
    accident scene</B>before driver is taken to hospital, the
    driver is free to wait and give notice of the accident to the
    nearest office of a duly authorized police authority, to be
    followed by a written report within 10 days. People v. Reyes,
    42 Colo. App. 73, 589 P.2d 1385 (1979).</P>
    <P>
    <B>Officer who investigates accident is foreseeable
    plaintiff.</B>If a driver causes an accident, it is foreseeable
    that public safety officers will respond to the scene, and the
    driver has a duty to exercise due care toward the officer

  the defendant. Such penalty assessment notice shall contain all

  satisfactory evidence of identity or who the officer has

  summons portion of such notice may be issued a penalty assessment
  notice if the defendant consents to be taken by the officer to
  the nearest mailbox and to mail the amount of the fine or penalty
  and surcharge thereon to the department. The peace officer shall
  advise the person arrested or cited of the points to be assessed
  in accordance with section 42-2-127. Except as otherwise provided
  in section 42-4-1710 (1)(b), acceptance of a penalty assessment
  notice and payment of the prescribed fine or penalty and
  surcharge thereon to the department shall be deemed a complete
  satisfaction for the violation, and the defendant shall be given
  a receipt which so states when such fine or penalty and surcharge

  officer issue a penalty assessment notice to a minor under the

  Should the defendant charged with an offense other than a traffic
  infraction accept service of the penalty assessment notice but
  fail to post the prescribed penalty and surcharge thereon within
  twenty days thereafter, the notice shall be construed to be a
  summons and complaint unless payment for such penalty assessment
  has been accepted by the department of revenue as evidenced by
  receipt. Should the defendant charged with a traffic infraction
  accept the notice but fail to post the prescribed penalty and
  surcharge thereon within twenty days thereafter, and should the
  department of revenue not accept payment for such penalty and
  surcharge as evidenced by receipt, the defendant shall be allowed
  to pay such penalty and surcharge thereon and the docket fee in
  the amount set forth in section 42-4-1710 (4) to the clerk of the
  court referred to in the summons portion of the penalty
  assessment notice during the two business days prior to the time

  be heard in the court of competent jurisdiction prescribed on the
  penalty assessment notice in the same manner as is provided by
  law for prosecutions of the misdemeanors not specified in
  subsection (4) of this section. If the penalty for a traffic
  infraction and surcharge thereon is not timely paid, the case
  shall thereafter be heard in the court of competent jurisdiction
  prescribed on the penalty assessment notice in the manner

  <COMMENT-HEAD>ANNOTATION</COMMENT-HEAD>
  <ANNO-NOTE>
    <ANNO-TEXT>
    <B>Annotator's note.</B>Since ยง 42-4-1701 is similar to ยง
    42-4-1501 as it existed prior to the 1994 amending of title 42
    as enacted by SB 94-1, relevant cases construing that provision
    have been included with the annotations to this section. 
    <P>
    <B>The simplified procedures of the penalty assessment statute
    do not impermissibly offend the due process clauses</B>of
    either the constitution of the state or the constitution of the
    United States. Since the penalty assessment statute does not
    deprive an offender accused of a traffic violation of his right
    to a trial, on the contrary, the statute not only expressly
    preserves the accused's right to a trial but also affords him
    an alternative procedure which he may accept or reject, and
    therefore the statute does not violate any constitutional
    rights. Cave v. Colo. Dept. of Rev., 31 Colo. App. 185, 501
    P.2d 479 (1972).</P>
    <P>Section 42-2-123 and this section give a licensee notice of
    the ramifications of his failure to appear and the forfeiture
    of his bond for traffic violation charge and due process
    requirements are satisfied. Lopez v. Motor Vehicle Div., 189
    Colo. 133, 538 P.2d 446 (1975).</P>
    <P>
    <B>Due process standard for using penalty assessment as
    conviction.</B>Through the provisions of ยง 42-2-121 (3), the
    general assembly has mandated a minimum standard of due process
    which must be followed before payment of a penalty assessment
    under this section may be used as a conviction for purposes of
    suspension or revocation of a driver's license pursuant to ยง
    42-2-123 (1)(a). Stortz v. Colo. Dept. of Rev., 195 Colo. 325,
    578 P.2d 229 (1978).</P>
    <P>
    <B>Speeding classifications constitutional.</B>Decision to
    treat higher rates of speeding as more serious making them
    criminal acts is within legislature's discretion and does not
    create a suspect class or infringe on a fundamental right.
    Drawing a distinction based on speed is rationally related to
    legislative purpose of safety and fuel conservation. People v.
    Lewis, 745 P.2d 668 (Colo. 1987).</P>
    <P>
    <B>Traffic violations not decriminalized.</B>The general
    assembly did not intend to decriminalize minor traffic
    violations by denominating them "misdemeanor traffic offenses"
    and prescribing a fine-only penalty scheme for certain grades
    of these offenses. City of Greenwood Vill. v. Fleming, 643 P.2d
    511 (Colo. 1982) (decided prior to 1982 amendments).</P>
    <P>
    <B>Jurisdiction of county courts includes offenses reclassified
    as "misdemeanor traffic offenses"</B>under this section.
    Phillips v. County Court, 42 Colo. App. 187, 591 P.2d 600
    (1979).</P>
    <P>
    <B>When points not assessable.</B>If a traffic violation does
    not appear on the summons, to be issued under the notice
    provisions of subsection (4)(a), and the offender is not
    advised by the arresting officer in reference to the points
    chargeable for the traffic violation, points cannot be assessed
    against him for that offense. Stortz v. Colo. Dept. of Rev.,
    195 Colo. 325, 578 P.2d 229 (1978).</P>
    <P>
    <B>Payment of ticket, and subsequent lack of protest, precludes
    challenge of conviction.</B>Where a party pays a traffic ticket
    without a court judgment or a signed acknowledgment of guilt,
    but does not challenge the validity of the conviction and
    affirms the accuracy of his driving record at a departmental
    hearing, the party may not then challenge the conviction.
    Martinez v. Dolan, 41 Colo. App. 513, 591 P.2d 588 (1978).</P>
    <P>

  <M>Every hearing in county court for the adjudication of a
  traffic infraction, as provided by this article, shall be held
  before a county court magistrate appointed pursuant to part 5 of
  article 6 of title 13, C.R.S., or before a county judge acting as
  a magistrate; except that, whenever a crime and a class A or
  class B traffic infraction or a crime and both such class A and
  class B traffic infractions are charged in the same summons and
  complaint, all charges shall be made returnable before a judge or
  magistrate having jurisdiction over the crime and the rules of
  criminal procedure shall apply. Nothing in this part 17 or in
  part 5 of article 6 of title 13, C.R.S., shall be construed to
  prevent a court having jurisdiction over a criminal charge
  relating to traffic law violations from lawfully entering a
  judgment on a case dealing with a class A or class B traffic
  infraction.</M>
  <P N="(2)">(2)
  <M>When a court of competent jurisdiction determines that a
  person charged with a class 1 or class 2 misdemeanor traffic
  offense is guilty of a lesser-included offense which is a class A
  or class B traffic infraction, the court may enter a judgment as
  to such lesser charge.</M></P>
  <P N="(3)">(3)
  <M>The burden of proof shall be upon the people, and the traffic
  magistrate shall enter judgment in favor of the defendant unless
  the people prove the liability of the defendant beyond a
  reasonable doubt. The district attorney or the district
  attorney's deputy may, in the district attorney's discretion,
  enter traffic infraction cases for the purpose of attempting a
  negotiated plea or a stipulation to deferred prosecution or
  deferred judgment and sentence but shall not be required to so
  enter by any person, court, or law, nor shall the district
  attorney represent the state at hearings conducted by a
  magistrate or a county judge acting as a magistrate on class A or
  class B traffic infraction matters. The magistrate or county
  judge acting as a magistrate shall be permitted to call and
  question any witness and shall also act as the fact finder at
  hearings on traffic infraction matters.</M></P>

  <M>A case in which the court entering judgment did not have
  jurisdiction over the person of the violator;</M></P>
  <P N="(5)(b)(III)">(III)
  <M>Where the court hearing the collateral attack finds by a
  preponderance of the evidence that the failure to seek relief
  within the applicable time period was caused by an adjudication
  of incompetence or by commitment or certification of the violator
  to an institution for treatment as a person with a mental health
  disorder; or</M></P>
  <P N="(5)(b)(IV)">(IV)
  <M>Where the court hearing the collateral attack finds that the

    <P>
    <B>This section prohibits the admission in evidence of the
    record of conviction of any person,</B>for violation of the
    state traffic laws, in a civil action. Ripple v. Brack, 132
    Colo. 125, 286 P.2d 625 (1955).</P>
    <P>This section prevents the admission of evidence of
    conviction for failure to yield in violation of ยง 42-4-703 (3).
    That evidence may not be introduced at trial or during summary
    judgment and may not serve as the basis for issue preclusion on
    the question of violation of a statute. Bullock v. Wayne, 623
    F. Supp. 2d 1247 (D. Colo. 2009).</P>
    <P>
    <B>Evidence of convictions under this article are only
    permissible in a habitual traffic offender
    proceeding.</B>Alhilo v. Kliem, 2016 COA 142, 412 P.3d 902.</P>
    <P>
    <B>Unless ยงยง 42-2-201 to 42-2-208 are implicated, evidence of a
    driver's prior traffic convictions is not admissible in a civil
    action,</B>even if such convictions caused the driver's license
    to be suspended at the time of the accident that is the subject
    of the civil action. Absent an adjudication by the department
    of revenue that the driver was an habitual offender, the
    convictions are inadmissible for any purpose, including to show
    that the prior convictions giving rise to the suspension
    indicated a habit, practice, and pattern of disregard for
    traffic regulations. Lawrence v. Taylor, 8 P.3d 607 (Colo. App.
    2000).</P>
    <P>
    <B>Highly speculative assertion in personal injury action that
    plaintiff's decedent would have been convicted of driving under
    suspension had he survived, and thus qualify as an habitual
    offender under ยงยง 42-2-201 to 42-2-208, does not meet the
    exception in this section.</B>Thus, the decedent's prior
    traffic convictions were properly excluded at trial. Lawrence
    v. Taylor, 8 P.3d 607 (Colo. App. 2000).</P>
    <P>
    <B>Section prohibits admission of evidence of charge of
    violation.</B>By this section, the general assembly obviously
    intended, by prohibiting the admission in evidence in a civil
    action of the record of conviction of any person for violation
    of the traffic laws, to prohibit also the asking questions as
    to whether or not the plaintiff had been charged in justice's
    court with a violation of the state traffic laws. Ripple v.
    Brack, 132 Colo. 125, 286 P.2d 625 (1955).</P>
    <P>
    <B>No prejudice to defendant.</B>The medical witness stated:
    "An auto hit him in the back and he got a ticket for reckless
    driving." The statement is ambiguous; for that reason it was
    proper to clarify since the plaintiff did not receive a ticket,
    and the defendant's counsel did not move to strike the
    statement. The facts do not bring the motion for mistrial
    within the ambit of the proscription of the statute, since the
    statement made no mention of a "conviction", nor was any effort
    made to introduce a "record of the conviction of any person".
    There was no prejudice to the defendant. Thompson v. Tartler,
    166 Colo. 247, 443 P.2d 365 (1968).</P>

    <B>Section not applicable to parties in collision of two
    automobiles.</B>Where two automobiles were involved in a
    collision at an intersection, none of the parties to an action
    arising out of the collision are within the purview of this
    section; for the intent of the enactment was neither
    exclusively, nor in part, to protect any interest of either of
    them. Any violation of it did not constitute a breach of any
    statutory duty owed, either to the violator or to the other
    party. Its provisions, therefore, are not determinative of any
    action between them. Hamilton v. Gravinsky, 174 Colo. 206, 483

    <B>Presence of school bus not determinative of negligence as

    intersection was a factor the jury could properly consider when
    making its determinations on the questions of the negligence of
    the respective parties to this case, under ordinary negligence
    principles; but its presence, and the existence of the statute
    regulating it, was not determinative, as a matter of law, of
    the issue of negligence. Hamilton v. Gravinsky, 28 Colo. App.
    408, 474 P.2d 185 (1970), aff'd in part and rev'd in part on

    title, preamble, history or otherwise, be construed as intended
    to protect only the interests of a particular class of
    individuals. If so, a violation of the enactment can make the
    actor liable only to a person of that class. Hamilton v.

  <M>The state board of education, by and with the advice of the
  executive director of the department, shall adopt and enforce
  regulations not inconsistent with this article to govern the
  operation of all school buses used for the transportation of
  schoolchildren and to govern the discharge of passengers from
  such school buses. Such regulations shall prohibit the driver of
  any school bus used for the transportation of schoolchildren from
  discharging any passenger from the school bus which will result
  in the passenger's immediately crossing a major thoroughfare,
  except for two-lane highways when such crossing can be done in a
  safe manner, as determined by the local school board in
  consultation with the local traffic regulatory authority, and
  shall prohibit the discharging or loading of passengers from the
  school bus onto the side of any major thoroughfare whenever
  access to the destination of the passenger is possible by the use
  of a road or street which is adjacent to the major thoroughfare.
  For the purposes of this section, a "major thoroughfare" means a
  freeway, any U.S. highway outside any incorporated limit,
  interstate highway, or highway with four or more lanes, or a
  highway or road with a median separating multiple lanes of
  traffic. Every person operating a school bus or responsible for
  or in control of the operation of school buses shall be subject
  to said regulations.</M>
  <P N="(2)">(2)
  <M>Any person operating a school bus under contract with a school
  district who fails to comply with any of said regulations is

  <N></N>(a)
  <M>To sell a motor vehicle that was abandoned on private

  commercially reasonable manner at a public or private sale held
  not less than thirty days nor more than sixty days after the
  postmarked date the notice was mailed pursuant to section
  42-4-2103 (4) or the date the operator receives notice that no
  record exists for such vehicle. The operator must make the sale
  to a licensed motor vehicle dealer or wholesaler, or wholesale
  motor vehicle auction dealer, or through a classified newspaper
  advertisement published in Colorado. The appraisal must be
  performed by an independent third person. For purposes of this
  section, a sale is not commercially reasonable if:</M>
  <P N="(1)(a)(I)">(I)
  <M>The vehicle's appraisal value is more than three hundred fifty

  <M>The operator fails to set the sale price at the time of sale,
  list the fair market price at the time of sale, or report the
  sale; or report the sale price to the department within five
  business days after the sale.</M></P>
  <P N="(1)(b)">(b)
  <M>Nothing in this section requires that an operator must be a
  licensed dealer pursuant to part 1 of article 20 of title 44 for
  purposes of selling a motor vehicle pursuant to this part
  21.</M></P>
  <P N="(1)(c)">(c)
  <M>Subject to section 42-4-2103 and if an operator conducts a
  commercially reasonable sale but fails to sell the motor vehicle,
  the operator may continue to collect daily storage fees for such
  vehicle actually accrued for up to one hundred twenty
  days.</M></P>
  <P N="(2)">(2)
  <M>If the appraised value of an abandoned motor vehicle sold
  pursuant to this section is three hundred fifty dollars or less,
  the sale shall be made only for the purpose of junking,
  scrapping, or dismantling such motor vehicle, and the purchaser
  thereof shall not, under any circumstances, be entitled to a
  Colorado certificate of title. The operator making the sale shall
  cause to be executed and delivered a bill of sale, together with
  a copy of the report described in section 42-4-2103 (3), to the
  person purchasing such motor vehicle. The bill of sale shall
  state that the purchaser acquires no right to a certificate of
  title for such vehicle. The operator making the sale shall
  promptly submit a report of sale, with a copy of the bill of
  sale, to the department and shall deliver a copy of such report
  of sale to the purchaser of the motor vehicle. Upon receipt of
  any report of sale with supporting documents on any sale made
  pursuant to this subsection (2), the department shall purge the
  records for such vehicle as provided in section 42-4-2109 (1)(b)
  and shall not issue a new certificate of title for such vehicle.
  Any certificate of title issued in violation of this subsection
  (2) shall be void.</M></P>
  <P N="(3)">(3)
  <M>If the appraised value of an abandoned motor vehicle sold
  pursuant to this section is more than three hundred fifty

  the report described in section 42-4-2103 (3), and an application
  for a Colorado certificate of title signed by a legally
  authorized representative of the operator conducting the sale, to
  the person purchasing such motor vehicle. The purchaser of the
  abandoned motor vehicle shall be entitled to a Colorado
  certificate of title upon application and proof of compliance
  with the applicable provisions of the "Certificate of Title Act",
  part 1 of article 6 of this title; except that, if such vehicle
  is less than five years old, including the current year models,
  and if the department does not provide the name of an owner of

  <N></N>(a)
  <N></N>(I)
  <M>The department or authorized agent shall mail or deliver
  certificates of title to motor or off-highway vehicles issued
  under this part 1 to the applicant, except as provided in section
  42-6-124, and the director shall retain and appropriately index
  and file information appearing and concerning the issuance of the
  certificates of title. The certificates may be electronic records
  in compliance with rules adopted by the director.</M>
  <P N="(1)(a)(II)">(II)
  <M>In addition to other information that the director may by rule
  require, the certificates of title must contain the make and
  model of the motor or off-highway vehicle described in the
  record, if the information is available, together with the motor
  and any other serial number of the vehicle, and a description of
  any other marks or symbols placed upon the vehicle by the vehicle
  manufacturer for identification purposes.</M></P>
  <P N="(1)(a)(III)">(III)
  <M>If a vehicle shows a brand in its title history, or if the
  vehicle is subject to a brand, the department shall place the
  appropriate brand on the certificate of title. If the vehicle has
  multiple brands, the department shall place the most recent brand
  on the certificate of title and the notice "other brands exist".
  If the brand is from a certificate of title issued in another
  jurisdiction, the brand must be carried forward to the Colorado
  certificate of title along with the name of the jurisdiction
  originating the brand.</M></P>
  <P N="(1)(a)(IV)">(IV)
  <M>The year listed on the certificate of title of a kit vehicle
  is the year of manufacture of the kit from which the vehicle was
  assembled, as indicated in the manufacturer's statement of
  origin.</M></P>
  <P N="(1)(b)(I)">(b)
  <N></N>(I)
  <M>Except as otherwise provided in subsection (1)(b)(II) of this
  section, the department may require those vehicle-related
  entities specified by regulation to verify information concerning
  a vehicle through the physical inspection of the vehicle. The
  information required to be verified by a physical inspection must
  include the vehicle identification number or numbers, the make of
  vehicle, the vehicle model, the type of vehicle, the year of
  manufacture of the vehicle, the type of fuel used by the vehicle,
  and other information as may be required by the department. For
  the purposes of this subsection (1)(b), "vehicle-related entity"
  means an authorized agent or designated employee of the agent, a
  Colorado law enforcement officer, a licensed Colorado dealer, a
  licensed inspection and readjustment station, or a licensed
  diesel inspection station.</M></P>
  <P N="(1)(b)(II)">(II)
  <M>The department shall not require a physical inspection as a
  condition for issuance of a certificate of title for a vehicle
  if:</M></P>
  <P N="(1)(b)(II)(A)">(A)
  <M>The applicant for a certificate of title for the vehicle
  presents either a copy of a manufacturer's certificate of origin
  or a purchase receipt from the dealer or the out-of-state seller
  from whom the applicant purchased the vehicle and either document
  indicates that the applicant purchased the vehicle as new;
  or</M></P>
  <P N="(1)(b)(II)(B)">(B)
  <M>At the time of application, the vehicle is currently titled in
  another county of the state.</M></P>
  <P N="(2)">(2)
  <M>The department or authorized agent shall include in the
  electronic record of the certificate or the paper version of the
  certificate a description of every lien on the motor or
  off-highway vehicle that appears in the application for the
  certificate of title or is unreleased upon a prior certificate of
  title for the vehicle, including the date of the lien, the
  original amount secured by the vehicle, the named lienee, and the
  county in which the lien appears of record if it is of public
  record. The department or authorized agent shall number
  certificates and electronic records consecutively by counties,
  beginning with number one. The certificate of title filed with
  the authorized agent is prima facie evidence of the contents of
  the record and that the person in whose name the certificate is
  registered is the lawful owner of the vehicle. Except as provided
  in section 42-6-118, the certificate remains effective after
  filing until the vehicle described in the record is sold or
  ownership is otherwise transferred.</M></P></SECTION-TEXT>

    <B>The certificate of title shall be prima facie evidence of

    P.2d 879 (1971).</P>
    <P>This part is a recording act by which prior interests can be

    (1974).</P>
    <P>
    <B>A certificate of title shall be prima facie evidence of the
    matters contained therein; a certificate of registration is
    presumptive evidence of ownership of an automobile, but the
    presumption is rebuttable.</B>A certificate of title does not
    represent conclusive proof of ownership. To overcome this
    presumption, a debtor must demonstrate that title alone does
    not determine ownership. Hill v. Koching, 338 B.R. 463 (Bankr.

    <P>
    <B>Regulation of possible abuse is legislative matter.</B>It
    may be that repossession of automobiles or any other property
    sold on time payment with an express agreement permitting such
    repossession without notice may be resulting in great abuses,
    and controls are needed. If so, the regulation of this abuse is
    a matter for the general assembly, not the courts. Sifuentes v.
    Weed, 186 Colo. 109, 525 P.2d 1157 (1974).</P>
    <P>
    <B>Activity of the director of revenue in the issuance of a new
    title to a repossessor of a motor vehicle is strictly
    limited</B>to the ministerial duty of providing prima facie
    evidence of what has already occurred by purely private action,
    namely, the transfer of title from the debtor to the creditor
    in a manner specifically provided for by their agreement. It
    does not in any meaningful way involve the director in the
    repossession and subsequent transfer of ownership to the

    <B>Showing of mortgages on title certificates.</B>The mobility
    of motor vehicles and their frequent sale in states far distant
    from the county of the mortgage filing has resulted in a new
    method of protection by means of showing mortgages on the title
    certificate, which can be carried with the car, rather than by
    record in the files of a distant and probably unknown county.
    Under the policy of our law the requisite of clear title is the
    possession of a certificate free of lien. Title depends on
    receipt of such a certificate, and ignorance of mortgages must
    be proven by the certificate. First Nat'l Bank v. Chuck Lowen,
    Inc., 128 Colo. 104, 261 P.2d 158 (1953); Loye v. Denver United

    <P>
    <B>This section must be construed with ยง 42-6-131.</B>Under ยง
    42-6-131, the recognition of a foreign mortgage in Colorado
    depends not upon its being filed for record, but upon its
    appearing on the certificate of title. That section must be
    construed together with this section which provides that except
    in cases not here applicable no person shall sell a motor
    vehicle without delivering a certificate of title and that no
    purchaser shall acquire any right, title, or interest in a
    motor vehicle unless he shall first obtain from the transferor
    the certificate of title thereto. By virtue of that section, on
    failure of an out-of-state dealer to deliver such certificate,
    whether because it showed a mortgage on its face or because it
    was deposited with the mortgagee, the purchaser could acquire
    no title as against prior mortgagees, and his rights are
    subordinate to such as are valid. First Nat'l Bank v. Chuck
    Lowen, Inc., 128 Colo. 104, 261 P.2d 158 (1953); Federico v.

    <B>The doctrine of title by accession does not apply to the

    <P>
    <B>Colorado's Certificate of Title Act operates as strictly as

    <B>Inapplicability of uniform commercial code to motor

    inventory, the provisions of the Colorado uniform commercial
    code applied in their entirety. Guy Martin Buick, Inc. v. Colo.
    Springs Nat'l Bank, 184 Colo. 166, 519 P.2d 354 (1974).</P>
    <P>
    <B>The uniform commercial code applies to a security interest
    in a motor vehicle held in inventory, notwithstanding the
    requirement in ยง 42-6-109 that the certificate of title is
    required to transfer an interest in a motor
    vehicle.</B>Although a bank had a perfected security interest
    in an auto dealer's inventory, the interest was extinguished
    upon sale of the vehicle because the bank authorized the sale
    of the inventory. Under ยง 4-9-315, the bank was left with a
    security interest only in the proceeds of the sale. Therefore,
    a credit union that financed the purchase of the vehicle from
    the dealer had a security interest that prevails against the
    bank, even though the certificate of title was not conveyed to
    the credit union at the time of sale. Valley Bank &amp; Trust
    Co. v. Holyoke Cmty. Fed. Credit Union, 121 P.3d 358 (Colo.
    App. 2005).</P>
    <P>
    <B>Substantial compliance with ยง 42-6-120.</B>This section
    provides that any mortgage intended to create a lien on a motor
    vehicle, to be effective as a valid lien against creditors of
    the owner, shall be filed for public record and the fact
    thereof noted on the certificate of title "substantially" in
    the manner provided by ยง 42-6-120 and the filing with the
    authorized agent and the notation by him of that fact on the
    certificate "substantially" in the manner provided in ยง
    42-6-120 shall constitute notice to the world of the existence
    of such mortgage. Loye v. Denver United States Nat'l Bank, 341
    F.2d 402 (10th Cir. 1965).</P>
    <P>
    <B>Notation of creditor as "owner" suffices.</B>A notation of
    the creditor as "owner" on the certificate of title constitutes
    substantial compliance with ยง 42-6-120. Yeager Trucking v.
    Circle Leasing, 29 B.R. 131 (Bankr. D. Colo. 1983).</P>
    <P>
    <B>The certificate of title act creates a system of notice
    filing</B>in which the certificate merely indicates who may
    have a security interest. Further inquiry from the parties is
    necessary to determine the complete state of affairs. Yeager
    Trucking v. Circle Leasing, 29 B.R. 131 (Bankr. D. Colo.
    1983).</P>
    <P>
    <B>Proper recording of chattel mortgages provides "notice to
    the world".</B>If there ever was any exception to the general
    rule of priority of chattel mortgages for a garageman's
    equitable lien for necessary repairs, it was eliminated by the
    enactment of this section which provides that properly
    recording and noting chattel mortgages on the title certificate
    provides "notice to the world". First Sec. Bank v. Crouse, 374
    F.2d 17 (10th Cir. 1967).</P>
    <P>
    <B>With recordation of a chattel mortgage, persons who
    subsequently deal with the chattel have constructive notice
    of</B>the encumbrance. Rabtoay Gen. Tire Co. v. Colo. Kenworth
    Corp., 135 Colo. 110, 309 P.2d 616 (1957).</P>
    <P>
    <B>Constructive notice is as effectual as actual
    notice.</B>Rabtoay Gen. Tire Co. v. Colo. Kenworth Corp., 135
    Colo. 110, 309 P.2d 616 (1957).</P>
    <P>
    <B>Superiority of recorded lien.</B>A creditor cannot obtain a
    judicial lien superior to a transferee's interest, once the
    requirements for the recording of the lien on a motor vehicle
    set out in this section and ยง 42-6-120 are fulfilled. GMAC v.
    Martella, 22 B.R. 649 (Bankr. D. Colo. 1982).</P>
    <P>
    <B>Mortgage cannot attach more value than amount noted on
    certificate.</B>Allowing a mortgage to attach having more value
    than the amount noted on the certificate of title would negate
    the purpose of this section and ยง 42-6-120, which is to make
    the certificate conclusive as to the rights of the parties with
    respect to notice of prior encumbrances. In re Grizaffi, 23
    B.R. 137 (Bankr. D. Colo. 1982).</P>
    <P>
    <B>Section inapplicable to foreign mortgages.</B>In view of ยง
    42-6-131, the provisions of this section requiring filing of
    mortgages does not apply to foreign mortgages. First Nat'l Bank
    v. Chuck Lowen, Inc., 128 Colo. 104, 261 P.2d 158 (1953).</P>
    <P>
    <B>Persons with no right in vehicle not protected by
    section.</B>Where a party has no rights to a motor vehicle,
    having been divested of all ownership, he is not within the
    four categories of persons protected by the filing requirements
    of this section. People v. Armijo, 197 Colo. 91, 589 P.2d 935

    <P>
    <B>The purpose of the title act was to provide a simple and
    effective means of ascertaining the title to and interests in
    motor vehicles</B>and that means is an examination of the title
    certificate itself. The provision in the statute requiring the
    notation on the title certificate of the filed chattel mortgage
    was designed to make that certificate conclusive as to the
    rights of the parties with respect to the matter of notice of
    prior encumbrances. It is not the province of this court to
    give to the statute a narrow interpretation out of harmony with
    the designed purpose and intent of the general assembly. Loye
    v. Denver United States Nat'l Bank, 341 F.2d 402 (10th Cir.

    <P>
    <B>Application of uniform commercial code where automobiles

  mortgage presenting to the director's authorized agent of the
  county where the mortgage is filed or in the county where the
  owner resides a certification of extension of chattel mortgage,
  subscribed by the holder of the mortgage and acknowledged by the
  holder before an officer authorized to acknowledge deeds to real

  <M>Second or other junior mortgages.</M></CATCH-LINE>(1)
  <M>On and after July 1, 1977, a person who takes a junior
  mortgage on a motor or off-highway vehicle for which a Colorado
  certificate of title has been issued or filed may file the
  mortgage for public record and have the existence of the mortgage
  noted or filed on the certificate of title with like effect as in
  other cases, as required by this section.</M>
  <P N="(2)">(2)
  <M>The junior mortgagee or the holder of the mortgage shall file
  the mortgage as required by section 42-6-121 with the authorized
  agent of the county where the mortgagor of the motor or
  off-highway vehicle resides or where the vehicle is located with
  a written request to have the existence of the mortgage noted or
  filed on the certificate of title records of the authorized agent
  pertaining to the vehicle covered by the junior mortgage. Upon
  the filing of the mortgage, the authorized agent shall note in
  the record of the vehicle the day and hour when the mortgage was
  received by the agent, shall make and deliver a receipt for the
  mortgage to the person filing the mortgage, and shall file the
  mortgage as required under section 42-6-122. If there is more
  than one mortgage or lien on the motor or off-highway vehicle,
  the department's authorized agent may electronically transmit the
  mortgage or lien to the first mortgage or lienholder and notify
  the first mortgage or lienholder of any additional mortgages or
  liens.</M></P>
  <P N="(3)">(3)
  <M>The director's authorized agent, by registered mail, return
  receipt requested, shall make a written demand on the holder of
  the certificate of title, addressed to such person at the
  person's address as the same may appear in said written request,
  that such certificate be delivered to the authorized agent for
  the purpose of having noted on the certificate such second or
  junior mortgage. Within fifteen days after the receipt of such
  demand, the person holding such certificate shall either mail or
  deliver the same to such director's authorized agent or, if the
  person no longer has possession of the certificate, shall so
  notify the agent and, if the person knows, shall likewise inform
  the agent where and from whom such certificate may be procured.
  Upon the receipt of such certificate, the director's authorized
  agent shall complete an application for a new title and record
  the number thereof on the mortgage, as in the case of a first
  mortgage, and shall, as in the case of a first mortgage, issue
  and file a new certificate of title on which record the existence
  of all mortgages on the motor vehicle, including such second or
  junior mortgage, have been noted.</M></P>
  <P N="(4)">(4)
  <M>If a person lawfully in possession of a certificate of title
  to a motor or off-highway vehicle, upon whom demand is made for
  the delivery to the authorized agent, fails to deliver or mail
  the certificate of title to the authorized agent, the person is
  liable to the holder of the junior mortgage for all damage
  sustained by reason of the omission.</M></P></SECTION-TEXT>

    <P>
    <B>Purpose, application, and limitations of section.</B>The
    purpose of this section, being to apprise a local purchaser of
    the existence of a foreign lien, it applies only to a regular
    and nonfraudulent foreign title, and its operation is limited
    to the protection of a local innocent purchaser where a foreign
    title is issued without notation of lien. Federico v. Universal
    C.I.T. Credit Corp., 140 Colo. 145, 343 P.2d 830 (1959).</P>
    <P>
    <B>Refusal to give effect to mortgage filed for record in
    foreign state.</B>In the first sentence of this section the
    general assembly has changed the prior law by refusing to give
    effect to a mortgage that is filed for record in a foreign
    state and nothing more, at least in a state which uses the
    system of certificates of title. Federico v. Universal C.I.T.
    Credit Corp., 140 Colo. 145, 343 P.2d 830 (1959).</P>
    <P>
    <B>Modified by second sentence of section.</B>If taken
    literally, the first sentence of this section would indicate
    that no foreign mortgage shall be enforceable against a
    subsequent purchaser for value in Colorado. However, the second
    sentence of the same section refers to the "certificate of
    title for such vehicle ... under the laws of ... any other
    state". Thus, it would appear that the second sentence modifies
    and thus limits the first sentence to application to mortgages
    originating in certificate of title states. Doenges-Glass, Inc.

    104, 261 P.2d 158 (1953).</P>

  <M>Upon the sale or transfer of a motor vehicle for which a
  current Colorado certificate of title has been issued or filed
  and that has become a salvage vehicle, the purchaser or
  transferee shall apply for a salvage certificate of title. The
  owner of the vehicle may apply for a salvage certificate of title
  before the sale or transfer of the vehicle. To be issued a
  salvage title, an owner applying for a salvage certificate of
  title must provide the director with evidence of ownership that
  satisfies the director of the applicant's right to have a salvage
  certificate of title filed in the applicant's favor.</M>

  salvage title, the owner must provide to the director evidence of
  ownership that satisfies the director that the applicant is
  entitled to file a certificate of title. The director shall place
  a designation in a conspicuous place in the record when a salvage
  vehicle has been made roadworthy. The director shall include the
  words "REBUILT FROM SALVAGE" and shall make the designation a

  <M>It is unlawful for any person to advertise for sale, to sell,
  to use, or to install or to have installed any device which
  causes an odometer to register any mileage other than the true

  <M>Nothing in this part 2 shall prevent the service, repair, or

  remains the same as before the service, repair, or replacement.
  When the odometer is incapable of registering the same mileage as
  before such service, repair, or replacement, the odometer shall
  be adjusted to read zero, and a notice in writing shall be
  attached to the left door frame of the vehicle by the owner or
  the owner's agent specifying the mileage prior to repair or
  replacement of the odometer and the date on which it was repaired
  or replaced. Any removal or alteration of such notice so affixed
  is unlawful.</M></P>
  <P N="(5)">(5)
  <M>It is unlawful for any transferor to fail to comply with 49

  <M>Legislative declaration.</M></CATCH-LINE>(1)
  <M>The general assembly is acutely aware of the toll in human
  suffering and loss of life, limb, and property caused by
  negligence in the operation of motor vehicles in our state.
  Although it recognizes that this basic problem can be and is
  being dealt with by direct measures designed to protect our
  people from the ravages of irresponsible drivers, the general
  assembly is also very much concerned with the financial loss
  visited upon innocent traffic accident victims by negligent
  motorists who are financially irresponsible. In prescribing the
  sanctions and requirements of this article, it is the policy of
  this state to induce and encourage all motorists to provide for
  their financial responsibility for the protection of others, and
  to assure the widespread availability to the insuring public of
  insurance protection against financial loss caused by negligent
  financially irresponsible motorists.</M>
  <P N="(2)(a)">(2)
  <N></N>(a)
  <M>The general assembly hereby finds that motor vehicle accidents
  cause a substantial economic impact in lost wages, medical bills,
  and property destruction exacerbated by the following:</M></P>
  <P N="(2)(a)(I)">(I)
  <M>Some negligent motorists are uninsured or flee the scene of an
  accident.</M></P>
  <P N="(2)(a)(II)">(II)
  <M>Negligent motorists often attempt to avoid financial
  responsibility by means such as fleeing the state, concealing
  their whereabouts, or failing to update the address on their
  driver's license with the department of revenue, thereby
  frustrating service of process and preventing the innocent victim
  from accessing either the negligent driver's liability insurance
  policy or the uninsured motorist coverage the victim has
  purchased.</M></P>
  <P N="(2)(a)(III)">(III)
  <M>When innocent traffic accident victims cannot access either
  the negligent driver's automobile liability policy or their own
  uninsured motorist coverage, the burden of the uncompensated
  losses are borne by the taxpayer in the form of taxes for
  medicaid, by trauma facilities in the form of uncompensated
  hospital-related costs, and by the innocent victim.</M></P>
  <P N="(2)(b)(I)">(b)
  <N></N>(I)
  <M>The state of Colorado encourages the widespread availability
  of uninsured or underinsured motorist insurance by requiring
  every motor vehicle liability policy delivered or issued in this
  state to contain uninsured motorist coverage unless the named
  insured rejects such coverage in writing.</M></P>
  <P N="(2)(b)(II)">(II)
  <M>Because insurance benefits have been paid for by either the
  negligent driver or the innocent victim for the purpose of
  compensating the innocent victim for injuries or losses, the
  general assembly declares that it is necessary to simplify the
  process for an innocent victim to access the negligent driver's
  liability insurance policy or his or her own uninsured motorist
  coverage in order to prevent the burden from being borne by the
  taxpayer or the health-care system.</M></P>
  <P N="(2)(c)">(c)
  <M>Therefore, the general assembly declares that the policy of
  Colorado is that all motor vehicle liability policies shall
  require policyholders of an automobile liability policy to
  appoint their insurance carrier as an agent for the purpose of
  service of process in certain limited instances in accordance
  with section 42-7-414 (3), and to deem a defendant to be
  uninsured for purposes of uninsured or underinsured motorist
  coverage if the court deems service on the defendant's insurance
  company to be ineffective or insufficient.</M></P></SECTION-TEXT>

    <P>
    <B>The modern trend of legislation is in the direction
    requiring operators of motor vehicles to maintain liability

    <P>
    <B>Insurance policies are definitely relevant to the subject

    occur, then the registration is to be cancelled and

    caused by the conduct of a negligent and financially
    irresponsible motorist. Kral v. Am. Hardware Mut. Ins. Co., 784
    P.2d 759 (Colo. 1989).</P>
    <P>Insurance coverage is not based on the number of uninsured
    or underinsured tortfeasors causing an accident, nor must an

    agreement to reduce the amount of benefits an insured might
    receive under an uninsured motorist clause of an insurance

    <P>
    <B>Provision in insurance policy that allowed the insurer to

  <P N="(2)">(2)
  <M>Every motor vehicle liability policy and every operator's

  <M>The liability of the insurance carrier under any such policy
  shall become absolute whenever loss or damage covered by such
  policy occurs, and the satisfaction by the insured of a final
  judgment for such loss or damage shall not be a condition
  precedent to the right or obligation of the carrier to make
  payment on account of such loss or damage. No fraud,
  misrepresentation, or other act of the insured in obtaining or
  retaining any such policy, or in adjusting a claim under any such
  policy, and no failure of the insured to give any notice, forward
  any paper, or otherwise cooperate with the insurance carrier
  shall constitute a defense as against the judgment creditor on
  any such judgment. The insurance carrier shall not be liable on
  any such judgment if it has not had reasonable notice of an
  opportunity to appear in and defend the action in which such
  judgment was rendered or if the judgment was obtained through
  collusion between the judgment creditor and the insured.</M></P>
  <P N="(2)(b)">(b)
  <M>The insurance carrier shall have the right to settle any claim
  covered by the policy, and if such settlement is made in good
  faith, the amount thereof shall be deductible from the limits of
  liability specified in the policy.</M></P>
  <P N="(2)(c)">(c)
  <M>No such policy shall be canceled except as provided in this
  section and section 42-7-416. The notice of cancellation shall be
  delivered to the named insured in person or mailed by certified
  mail, post-office receipt secured, or by registered mail prior to
  such cancellation. Unless the contract or policy of insurance
  provides for a shorter period of notice, said notice shall be so
  delivered or mailed to the address shown in the policy not less
  than thirty days prior to the date of cancellation. Proof of such
  mailing shall be sufficient proof of cancellation. Failure by any
  insurer to comply with the provisions for cancellation in this
  section and section 42-7-416 shall render invalid any such
  cancellation.</M></P>
  <P N="(2)(d)">(d)
  <M>No such policy shall be canceled or annulled as respects any
  loss or damage by any agreement between the carrier and the
  insured after the said insured has become responsible for such
  loss or damage, and any such cancellation or annulment shall be
  void.</M></P>
  <P N="(2)(e)">(e)
  <M>The policy may provide that the insured, or any other person
  covered by the policy, shall reimburse the insurance carrier for
  payment made on account of any loss or damage claim or suit
  involving a breach of the terms, provisions, or conditions of the
  policy. If the policy provides for limits in excess of the limits
  specified in section 42-7-103 (14), the insurance carrier may
  plead against any plaintiff, with respect to the amount of such
  excess limits of liability, any defenses which it may be entitled
  to plead against the insured, and any such policy may further

  <M>The insurance carrier that issues a motor vehicle liability

  insured for service of process, pleadings, or other filings in a
  civil action brought against the insured or to which the insured
  has been joined as a defendant or respondent in any Colorado
  court if the cause of action concerns an incident for which the
  insured can possibly claim coverage. Subsequent termination of
  the insurance policy does not affect the appointment for an
  incident that occurred when the policy was in effect. The insured
  agrees that any such civil action may be commenced against the
  insured by the service of process upon the insurance carrier as
  if personal service had been made directly on the insured. The
  insurance carrier agrees to forward all communications related to
  service of process to the last-known e-mail and mailing address
  of the policyholder in order to coordinate any payment of claims
  or defense of claims that are required."</M></P>
  <P N="(3)(b)">(b)

  <M>If service of process is made on the insurance carrier under
  this subsection (3) and the court enters judgment or the

  liability shall not exceed the policy limits of the coverage. A

  personal service on the person who caused the injury and seeking
  additional remedies provided by law.</M></P>

    <B>Purpose and provisions of section.</B>The purpose of this
    section is to foster and promote insurance coverage or, in the
    event of accident, a bond to insure financial responsibility.
    Its ultimate object is to provide compensation for innocent
    persons who might be injured through faulty operation of motor
    vehicles. Toward these ends, it provides inter alia that: (1)
    The insurance carrier's liability shall become absolute
    whenever loss or damage covered by the policy occurs; (2) that
    attempted satisfaction of final judgment by insured shall not
    be a condition precedent to the obligation of carrier to make
    payment; (3) that fraud, misrepresentation or other act of
    insured in obtaining the policy shall not constitute a defense

  <M>No repairs on a motor vehicle shall be performed by a motor
  vehicle repair facility unless the facility obtains the written
  consent of the customer.</M>
  <P N="(1)(b)">(b)
  <M>The required written consent is waived by the customer only
  when the motor vehicle has been towed to the motor vehicle repair
  facility or the customer has left the motor vehicle with the
  motor vehicle repair facility outside of normal business hours or
  when the customer has signed a waiver in compliance with
  paragraph (b) of subsection (2) of this section. The waiver
  established by this paragraph (b) for any vehicle that is towed
  to a motor vehicle repair facility or left with the motor vehicle
  repair facility outside of normal business hours is limited to a
  maximum of one hundred dollars for all labor and parts.</M></P>

  of such communication and consent shall be made on the work order
  by the motor vehicle repair facility and shall include the date,
  time, manner of consent, telephone number called, if any, and the
  names of the persons giving and receiving such consent. If more
  than one such communication occurs between the motor vehicle

  unless said facility first submits in writing or, where allowed
  by this section, orally communicates to the customer an estimate
  of the total cost of any such repairs. The written estimate shall
  include the expected completion date of such repairs. A copy of

  within three days, exclusive of Saturday, Sunday, any legal
  holiday, and any days the repair facility is closed for business,
  after notification of the completion of authorized repairs or if
  the customer failed to authorize repairs to be performed within
  three days, exclusive of Saturday, Sunday, any legal holiday, and
  any days the repair facility is closed for business, after the
  date of communication of an estimate.</M></P>
  <P N="(2)(a)(II)(B)">(B)
  <M>Storage charges shall be assessed in accordance with section

  conspicuously that, except for body shop repair parts and
  exchanged or warranty parts that shall only be presented to the

  inflatable restraint system components, the customer is entitled
  to the return of the replaced parts if the customer so requests
  at the time of consenting to or authorizing the repairs.</M></P>

  written or oral, prior to authorizing repairs by signing the
  customer's name and the date below the following statement that
  shall be in bold type:</M>
  <B>"I DO NOT WISH TO RECEIVE ANY ESTIMATE, EITHER WRITTEN OR

  <M>In the event that it is necessary to disassemble, or partially
  disassemble, a motor vehicle or a motor vehicle part in order to
  provide the customer with an estimate for required repairs, the
  written estimate required in paragraph (a) of this subsection (2)
  shall show the cost of reassembly in the event that the customer
  elects not to proceed with the repairs of the motor vehicle or
  motor vehicle part. The estimate shall also include the total
  cost of labor and parts to replace those expendable items that
  are normally destroyed by such disassembly. No act of disassembly
  that would prevent the restoration of the same unit to its former
  condition may be undertaken unless the motor vehicle repair
  facility has fully informed the customer of that fact in writing
  on the work order and the customer consents to the
  disassembly.</M></P>

  <M>Any estimate of required repairs given after a disassembly
  shall comply with the requirements of paragraph (a) of this

  vehicle repair facility, including the date, time, manner of
  communication, telephone number called, if any, and names of
  persons giving and receiving such consent. If more than one such

  after the original completion date, exclusive of Saturday,
  Sunday, and any legal holiday. If communicated orally, a record
  of such communication shall be made on the work order by the
  motor vehicle repair facility and shall include the date, time,

  has been canceled in this manner, the motor vehicle repair
  facility shall be required to reassemble the motor vehicle in
  substantially the same condition in which it was delivered to the
  motor vehicle repair facility without cost to the customer unless
  the customer has been previously notified as to the
  impracticality of such reassembly; except that the customer shall
  be required to pay for any repairs already completed as specified

  <M>If the manufacturer, its agent, or its authorized dealer is
  unable to conform the motor vehicle to the warranty by repairing
  or correcting the defect or condition which substantially impairs
  the use and market value of such motor vehicle after a reasonable
  number of attempts, the manufacturer shall, at its option,
  replace the motor vehicle with a comparable motor vehicle or
  accept return of the motor vehicle from the consumer and refund
  to the consumer the full purchase price, including the sales tax,
  license fees, and registration fees and any similar governmental
  charges, less a reasonable allowance for the consumer's use of
  the motor vehicle. Refunds shall be made to the consumer and
  lienholder, if any, as their interests may appear. A reasonable
  allowance for use shall be that amount directly attributable to
  use by the consumer and any previous consumer prior to the
  consumer's first written report of the nonconformity to the
  manufacturer, agent, or dealer and during any subsequent period
  when the vehicle is not out of service by reason of repair.</M>

  <M>The same nonconformity has been subject to repair four or more
  times by the manufacturer, its agent, or its authorized dealer
  within the warranty term or during a period of one year following

  <M>The motor vehicle is out of service by reason of repair for a

  <P N="(2)(b)">(b)
  <M>For the purposes of this subsection (2), the term of a

  subsection (2) apply against a manufacturer unless the

  <M>Except for motor vehicles that are entitled to registration

  <P N="(1)(a)">(a)
  <M>Such collector's items are registered for periods of five

  surcharge imposed pursuant to section 43-4-804 (1)(a) or 43-4-805
  (5)(g), C.R.S., is the amount specified in the applicable
  section. In addition to any other taxes and fees, if a
  collector's item is registered in a county that is a member of a
  highway authority and the authority has imposed an annual motor
  vehicle registration fee pursuant to section 43-4-506 (1)(k),
  C.R.S., then five times such annual motor vehicle registration

  <M>An owner of a collector's item that is not operated upon the

  the purpose of maintenance, repair, restoration, rebuilding, or
  any other similar purpose shall pay an annual specific ownership
  tax as provided in section 42-3-106 on any such motor vehicle
  owned by the owner, except owners of parts cars or licensed
  garages or licensed automobile dealers. The owner shall pay the

  42-12-301.</M></P>
  <P N="(2)(b)">(b)
  <M>Upon payment of the specific ownership tax as provided in this
  subsection (2), the department shall issue to the owner of the
  motor vehicle for which the tax has been paid a license, sticker,
  decal, or other device evidencing such payment, as may be
  prescribed by the director. When such device or license is
  affixed to the motor vehicle for which it is issued, the owner of
  that motor vehicle is permitted to keep such motor vehicle on
  private property for the purposes of maintenance, repair,
  restoration, rebuilding, or renovation.</M></P>

  <M>Notwithstanding the amount specified for any fee in subsection
  (1) of this section, the director by rule or as otherwise
  provided by law may reduce the amount of one or more of the fees
  if necessary pursuant to section 24-75-402 (3), C.R.S., to reduce
  the uncommitted reserves of the fund to which all or any portion
  of one or more of the fees is credited. After the uncommitted
  reserves of the fund are sufficiently reduced, the director by
  rule or as otherwise provided by law may increase the amount of
  one or more of the fees as provided in section 24-75-402 (4),
  C.R.S.</M></P>

  <M>An applicant may apply for personalized license plates issued

  If the applicant complies with section 42-3-211, the department
  may issue such plates upon payment of the additional fee required
  by section 42-3-211 (6) for personalized license plates. If the
  applicant has existing personalized license plates for a motor
  vehicle, the applicant may transfer the combination of letters or
  numbers to a new set of license plates for the vehicle upon
  paying the fee imposed by section 42-3-211 (6)(a) and upon
  turning in such existing plates to the department as required by
  the department. A person who has obtained personalized plates
  under this subsection (4) shall pay the annual fee imposed by
  section 42-3-211 (6)(b) to renew such plates. The fees imposed by
  this subsection (4) are in addition to all other taxes and fees

  <P N="(2)(g)">(g)
  <M>That, in order to obtain a hearing concerning the validity of

  to be transported or shipped, a hazardous material by motor
  vehicle. Such rules and regulations may govern any safety aspect
  of the transportation of hazardous materials which the chief
  deems appropriate, including, but not limited to, the packaging,
  handling, labeling, marking, and placarding of hazardous
  materials and motor vehicles transporting hazardous materials,
  the qualifications of drivers of motor vehicles transporting
  hazardous materials, financial responsibility requirements, and
  the use of any package or container in the transportation of
  hazardous materials which is not manufactured, fabricated,

  materials.</M></P>
  <P N="(3)">(3)
  <M>In adopting such rules and regulations, the chief shall use as
  general guidelines the standards and specifications for the safe
  transportation of hazardous materials contained in federal
  statutes, and in the rules and regulations promulgated
  thereunder, as amended from time to time. The rules and
  regulations adopted by the chief shall not unduly burden
  interstate or intrastate commerce and shall be no more stringent
  than federal statutes and the rules and regulations promulgated
  thereunder.</M></P>
  <P N="(4)">(4)
  <M>The rules and regulations adopted by the chief pursuant to
  subsection (2) of this section shall not apply to farm machinery
  which is exempted from registration requirements pursuant to
  section 42-3-103, agricultural distribution equipment attached to
  or conveyed by such farm machinery, or vehicles used to transport

  <N></N>(a)
  <M>The patrol, after consultation with local governmental
  authorities, has the sole authority to designate which public
  roads are to be used and which are not to be used by motor
  vehicles transporting hazardous materials. The patrol shall
  exercise its authority in accordance with section 42-20-302.
  Gasoline, diesel fuel, and liquefied petroleum gas are exempt
  from route designation unless the petitioning authority specified
  in section 42-20-302 requests their inclusion. The patrol may
  exempt crude oil from route designation after a request from the
  petitioning authority.</M>
  <P N="(1)(b)">(b)
  <M>The patrol may include, as part of designated route
  restrictions, the closing of streets and highways and other
  conditions or restrictions the patrol deems advisable, except for
  hours of operation and curfews.</M></P>
  <P N="(1)(c)">(c)
  <M>Routes designated by the patrol in accordance with this part 3

  the state of Colorado. As an origination point of nuclear waste
  and a corridor state through which nuclear materials pass, the
  state has a duty to protect its citizens and environment from all
  hazards created by the transportation of nuclear materials within
  its borders. State and public participation in planning for the
  transport of nuclear materials and in the development of a plan
  to cope with all phases of the nuclear materials problem is
  essential in order to adequately prepare for potential nuclear
  incidents. To that end, it is the purpose of this part 4 and part

  <M>Violations - civil penalties - motor
  vehicles.</M></CATCH-LINE>(1)
  <M>Any person who violates any provision of this part 4 or part 5
  of this article 20 or a rule or regulation promulgated by the
  chief pursuant to this part 4 and part 5 of this article 20,
  except for the violations enumerated in subsection (3) of this
  section and section 42-20-505, is subject to a civil penalty of
  not more than ten thousand dollars per day for each day during
  which the violation occurs. The penalty shall be assessed by the
  chief upon receipt of a complaint by any Colorado state patrol
  officer and after written notice and an opportunity for a hearing
  pursuant to section 24-4-105. Payment of a civil penalty under
  this section does not relieve any person from liability pursuant
  to article 11 of title 25, part 3 of article 15 of title 25, or
  article 22 of title 29. Any person who is assessed a penalty
  pursuant to this subsection (1) has the right to appeal the
  chief's decision by filing a notice of appeal with the court of
  appeals as specified in section 24-4-106 (11).</M>
  <P N="(2)">(2)
  <M>Any person who commits any of the acts enumerated in
  subsection (3) of this section is subject to the civil penalty
  listed in said subsection (3). Officers of the Colorado state
  patrol have the authority to issue civil penalty assessments for
  the enumerated violations. At any time that a person is cited for
  a violation enumerated in subsection (3) of this section, the
  person in charge of or operating the motor vehicle involved shall
  be given a notice in the form of a civil penalty assessment
  notice. The notice shall be tendered by the officer of the
  Colorado state patrol and must contain the name and address of
  the person, the license number of the motor vehicle involved, if
  any, the number of the person's driver's license, the nature of
  the violation, the amount of the penalty prescribed for the
  violation, the date of the notice, a place for the person to
  execute a signed acknowledgment of his or her receipt of the
  civil penalty assessment notice, a place for the person to
  execute a signed acknowledgment of liability for the cited
  violation, and such other information as may be required by law
  to constitute the notice as a complaint to appear in court should
  the prescribed penalty not be paid within ten days. Every cited
  person shall execute the signed acknowledgment of his or her
  receipt of the civil penalty assessment notice. The
  acknowledgment of liability shall be executed at the time the
  cited person pays the prescribed penalty. The person cited shall
  pay the civil penalty specified in subsection (3) of this section
  for the violation involved at the office of the department of
  revenue either in person or by postmarking such payment within
  ten days of the citation. The department of revenue shall accept
  late payment of any penalty assessment up to twenty days after
  the payment becomes due. If the person cited does not pay the
  prescribed penalty within ten days of the notice, the civil
  penalty assessment notice shall constitute a complaint to appear
  in court unless payment for the penalty assessment has been
  accepted by the department of revenue as evidenced by receipt,
  and the person cited shall, within the time specified in the
  civil penalty assessment notice, file an answer to this complaint
  with the county court for the county in which the penalty
  assessment was issued. The attorney general shall represent the
  Colorado state patrol if so requested by the Colorado state
  patrol.</M></P>
