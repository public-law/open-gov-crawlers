  <M>Except as otherwise provided in part 4 of this article for
  commercial drivers, no person shall drive any motor vehicle upon
  a highway in this state unless such person has been issued a
  currently valid driver's or minor driver's license or an
  instruction permit by the department under this article.</M>
  <P N="(2)">(2)
  <M>No person shall drive any motor vehicle upon a highway in this

  been expired for one year or less and such person has not been
  issued another such license by the department or by another state
  or country subsequent to such expiration.</M></P>
  <P N="(3)">(3)
  <M>No person shall drive any motor vehicle upon a highway in this
  state unless such person has in his or her immediate possession a
  current driver's or minor driver's license or an instruction
  permit issued by the department under this article.</M></P>
  <P N="(4)">(4)
  <M>No person who has been issued a currently valid driver's or
  minor driver's license or an instruction permit shall drive a
  type or general class of motor vehicle upon a highway in this
  state for which such person has not been issued the correct type
  or general class of license or permit.</M></P>
  <P N="(5)">(5)
  <M>No person who has been issued a currently valid driver's or
  minor driver's license or an instruction permit shall operate a
  motor vehicle upon a highway in this state without having such
  license or permit in such person's immediate possession.</M></P>
  <P N="(6)">(6)
  <M>A charge of a violation of subsection (2) of this section
  shall be dismissed by the court if the defendant elects not to
  pay the penalty assessment and, at or before the defendant's
  scheduled court appearance, exhibits to the court a currently
  valid driver's or minor driver's license.</M></P>
  <P N="(7)">(7)
  <M>A charge of a violation of subsection (5) of this section
  shall be dismissed by the court if the defendant elects not to
  pay the penalty assessment and, at or before the defendant's
  scheduled court appearance, exhibits to the court a currently
  valid license or permit issued to such person or an officially
  issued duplicate thereof if the original is lost, stolen, or
  destroyed.</M></P>
  <P N="(8)">(8)
  <M>The conduct of a driver of a motor vehicle which would
  otherwise constitute a violation of this section is justifiable
  and not unlawful when:</M></P>
  <P N="(8)(a)">(a)
  <M>It is necessary as an emergency measure to avoid an imminent
  public or private injury which is about to occur by reason of a
  situation occasioned or developed through no conduct of said
  driver and which is of sufficient gravity that, according to
  ordinary standards of intelligence and morality, the desirability
  and urgency of avoiding the injury clearly outweigh the
  desirability of avoiding the injury sought to be prevented by
  this section; or</M></P>

  <M>The applicable conditions for exemption, as set forth in
  section 42-2-102, exist.</M></P>
  <P N="(9)">(9)
  <M>The issue of justification or exemption is an affirmative
  defense. As used in this subsection (9), "affirmative defense"
  means that, unless the state's evidence raises the issue
  involving the particular defense, the defendant, to raise the
  issue, shall present some credible evidence on that issue. If the
  issue involved in an affirmative defense is raised, then the
  liability of the defendant must be established beyond a
  reasonable doubt as to that issue as well as all other elements
  of the traffic infraction.</M></P>
  <P N="(10)">(10)
  <M>Any person who violates any provision of subsection (1) or (4)
  of this section commits a class A traffic infraction. Any person
  who violates any provision of subsection (2), (3), or (5) of this
  section commits a class B traffic infraction.</M></P>
  <P N="(11)">(11)
  <M>Notwithstanding any law to the contrary, a second or
  subsequent conviction under subsection (1) or (4) of this
  section, when a person receiving such conviction has not
  subsequently obtained a valid Colorado driver's license or the
  correct type or general class of license, shall result in the
  assessment by the department of six points against the driving
  privilege of the person receiving such second or subsequent
  conviction.</M></P></SECTION-TEXT>

  or motorcycle, would otherwise be qualified to obtain a license
  under this article may apply for a temporary instruction permit
  in accordance with sections 42-2-107 and 42-2-108. The department
  shall issue a permit entitling an applicant, who is sixteen years

  permit in the applicant's immediate possession, to drive a motor
  vehicle or motorcycle upon the highways when accompanied by the
  parent, stepparent, grandparent with power of attorney, or
  guardian or foster parent, who signed the affidavit of liability
  pursuant to section 42-2-108 (1)(a), who holds a valid Colorado

  the immediate proximate supervision of a licensed driver, who
  holds a valid Colorado driver's license and is twenty-one years
  of age or older, authorized under this article to drive a
  motorcycle. In addition, the parent, stepparent, grandparent with
  power of attorney, or guardian or foster parent, who is
  authorized pursuant to this section to supervise the minor driver
  while the minor is driving, may allow the minor, while having the
  permit in the applicant's immediate possession, to drive with an
  individual who holds a valid driver's license and is twenty-one
  years of age or older for additional driving experience, but such
  additional driving experience shall not count toward the
  requirement established in section 42-2-104. The permit shall
  expire three years after issuance. The department shall issue a
  permit entitling the applicant, who is eighteen years of age or
  older, while having the permit in the applicant's immediate
  possession, to drive a motor vehicle or motorcycle upon the
  highways when accompanied by a driver, who holds a valid Colorado
  driver's license and is twenty-one years of age or older, who

  may appoint an alternate permit supervisor. An alternate permit

  <ANNO-NOTE>

    <B>Annotator's note.</B>Since § 42-2-108 is similar to §
    42-2-107 as it existed prior to the 1994 amending of title 42
    as enacted by SB 94-1, relevant cases construing that provision
    have been included with the annotations this section. 
    <P>
    <B>Legislative intent.</B>While granting minors under the age
    of 18 the opportunity to gain experience in driving an
    automobile and granting them the privilege of using the public
    highways, the general assembly sought by this section to
    safeguard against the indiscretions of the inexperienced,
    youthful driver by requiring a financially responsible adult to
    assume the liability for accidents negligently or willfully
    caused by the youth. This was done, first, with the hope, that,
    having assumed the liability, the parent or guardian would
    exercise some degree of control over the minor's driving
    habits, and, second, to insure that the innocent victim of such
    negligence would be compensated for his injuries. Bilsten v.
    Porter, 33 Colo. App. 208, 516 P.2d 656 (1973); Lahey v.
    Benjou, 759 P.2d 855 (Colo. App. 1988).</P>
    <P>
    <B>Strict construction.</B>This section, in derogation of the
    common law, is to be strictly construed. Bilsten v. Porter, 33
    Colo. App. 208, 516 P.2d 656 (1973).</P>
    <P>
    <B>The statutory language of this section itself contains no
    express limitations on the parent's liability,</B>and this is
    true whether or not the minor has disobeyed the terms of his
    temporary instruction license. Bilsten v. Porter, 33 Colo. App.
    208, 516 P.2d 656 (1973).</P>
    <P>
    <B>Subsection (1) does not provide for notice</B>but merely
    requires that the person who signed the application attend the
    hearing. Lopez v. Motor Vehicle Div., 189 Colo. 133, 538 P.2d
    446 (1975).</P>
    <P>
    <B>Effect of § 42-2-102 (1)(d).</B>Subsection (1) only requires
    that the licensee be accompanied at the hearing by the person
    who signed the application of the minor, unless that person
    submits a verified statement. However, where licensees have
    never been required to apply for licenses in the state of
    Colorado, by virtue of § 42-2-102 (1)(d), and since no person
    was required to sign their applications, no one is required to
    attend the hearing other than the licensees themselves. Lopez

    <P>
    <B>This section does not confer upon a police officer unlimited

    a driver's license. People v. McPherson, 191 Colo. 81, 550 P.2d
    311 (1976).</P>
    <P>A construction of this section which would give to police
    officers carte blanche authority in stopping cars would be
    inconsistent with section 16-3-103, which specifically limits
    an officer's authority to stop persons for investigation in the

  <M>Whenever any person, after applying for or receiving a
  driver's license or identification card, moves from the address
  named in such application or in the license or identification
  card issued to such person or when the name of the licensee is
  changed, such person shall, within thirty days, provide notice to
  the department of such person's old and new address and the
  number of any license or identification card held by such person.
  Such notice shall be provided to the department in writing or in
  electronic form on the department's official website. A licensee
  who changes his or her name shall, within thirty days, apply in
  person to renew such license pursuant to section 42-2-118 and in
  compliance with sections 42-2-107 and 42-2-305.</M>

  <M>All notices and orders required to be given to any licensee or
  registered owner under the provisions of the motor vehicle laws
  shall be in writing; and, if mailed, postpaid by first-class
  mail, to him or her at the last-known address shown by the
  records kept by the department pursuant to this article. Such
  mailing shall be sufficient notice in accord with the motor
  vehicle laws. Any notice or order of the department mailed
  first-class under the provisions of this title creates a
  presumption for administrative purposes that such notice or order
  was received if the department maintains a copy of the notice or
  order and maintains a certification that the notice or order was
  deposited in the United States mail by an employee of the
  department. Evidence of a copy of the notice mailed to the

  by the department pursuant to this article and a certification of
  mailing by a department employee, or evidence of delivery of
  notice in person to the last-known address of the licensee as

  upon any attorney appearing on the licensee's behalf of the order
  of denial, cancellation, suspension, or revocation of the license

    <B>Annotator's note.</B>Since § 42-2-119 is similar to §
    42-2-117 as it existed prior to the 1994 amending of title 42
    as enacted by SB 94-1, relevant cases construing that provision
    have been included with the annotations to this section. 
    <P>
    <B>Constitutionality.</B>The notification provisions of
    Colorado's traffic code are no more burdensome on nonresidents
    than residents and do not treat similarly situated classes of
    drivers differently. Accordingly, a nonresident driver is not
    denied equal protection of the laws by these provisions.

    1983).</P>
    <P>The methods used to notify purported nonresident traffic
    offenders are not so unconstitutionally deficient as to violate
    due process rights. Klingbeil v. State, Dept. of Rev., 668 P.2d
    930 (Colo. 1983).</P>
    <P>
    <B>Conviction under this section</B>does not constitute an
    "offense committed while operating a motor vehicle" for
    purposes of § 42-2-130. Lathe v. State, 691 P.2d 356 (Colo.

  <M>Methods of service.</M></CATCH-LINE>(1)
  <M>Any notice or order required to be served under the provisions
  of the motor vehicle laws may be served in any manner reasonably
  designed to notify the person to be served of the material
  provisions of such notice or order. A person has been served with
  a notice or order when such person has knowledge of the material
  provisions of such notice or order, regardless of the manner in
  which such knowledge was acquired. Any irregularity in the form
  or manner of service or documentation of the proof of service or
  the means by which knowledge of the material provisions of a
  notice or order is acquired shall not affect the validity of such
  notice or order.</M>
  <P N="(2)">(2)
  <M>For purposes of notices or orders relating to driving
  restraints only, "material provisions" means those provisions
  which identify the affected person, and those provisions which
  state that a restraint against the person's license or privilege
  to drive in this state has been, or will be, entered on the
  records of the department, or those provisions which advise the
  person that he or she has a right to request a hearing regarding
  the imposition of a restraint against such person's license or
  privilege to drive.</M></P>
  <P N="(3)">(3)
  <M>The department shall develop proof of service forms which may
  be used to document proof of service under this subsection (3).
  Such forms shall include but need not be limited to the
  following:</M></P>
  <P N="(3)(a)">(a)
  <M>The name and date of birth of the person served;</M></P>
  <P N="(3)(b)">(b)
  <M>The date and time of service;</M></P>
  <P N="(3)(c)">(c)
  <M>The identification number of the notice or order served, if
  any, or, in the event the notice or order is not available, a
  description of the information relayed to the person
  served;</M></P>
  <P N="(3)(d)">(d)
  <M>The name, title, signature, and employing agency of the person
  making service;</M></P>
  <P N="(3)(e)">(e)
  <M>The signature of the person served; and</M></P>
  <P N="(3)(f)">(f)
  <M>The right index fingerprint of the person served.</M></P>
  <P N="(4)">(4)
  <M>In addition to service by mail or any other means, service of
  notices or orders may be personally made by any employee of the
  department, any peace officer, any municipal, county, or state
  prosecutor, or any municipal, county or district court judge,
  magistrate, or judicial officer. If service is personally made
  under this subsection (4), proof of such service of any notice or
  order may be made by sending a written notification of service in
  any form to the department. Such notification shall be an
  official record of the department under section 42-2-121. It
  shall not be necessary that the written notification is on a form
  supplied by the department, but the department may refuse to
  accept as an official record a written notification which does
  not provide substantially the same information as specified in
  subsection (3) of this section.</M></P>
  <P N="(5)">(5)
  <M>Peace officers and employees of the department shall serve
  notices and orders relating to driving restraints upon the
  affected person anytime the affected person is contacted by a
  peace officer or employee of the department, when such peace
  officer or employee believes that the affected person may not
  have been previously personally served with any notice or order
  affecting such person's license or privilege to drive a motor
  vehicle in this state.</M></P></SECTION-TEXT>

  <M>Except as otherwise provided, whenever any person is convicted
  of any offense for which this article makes mandatory the
  revocation or suspension of the driver's or minor driver's
  license of such person by the department, the court in which such
  conviction is had shall require the offender to immediately
  surrender such driver's or minor driver's license or any
  instruction permit to the court at the time of conviction, and
  the court shall, not later than ten days after such conviction,
  forward the license to the department, together with a record of
  such conviction on the form prescribed by the department. Any
  person who does not immediately surrender such person's license
  or permit to the court commits a class 2 misdemeanor traffic
  offense, unless such person swears or affirms under oath
  administered by the court and subject to the penalties of perjury
  that the license or permit has been lost, destroyed, or is not in
  said person's immediate possession. Any person who swears or
  affirms that the license or permit is not in the immediate
  possession of said person shall surrender said license or permit
  to the court within five days of the sworn or affirmed statement,
  and if not surrendered within such time, said person commits a
  class 2 misdemeanor traffic offense.</M>
  <P N="(1)(b)">(b)
  <M>Whenever the driver's history of any person shows that such

  maintaining the required financial responsibility for the future,
  the court shall require the immediate surrender to it of the
  driver's, minor driver's, or temporary driver's license or any
  instruction permit held by such person, and the court, within

  federal military installation in this state shall forward to the
  department a record of the conviction of any person in said court
  or by said authority for a violation of any said laws not later
  than ten days after the day of sentencing for such conviction and
  may recommend the suspension or retention of the driver's, minor

  <P N="(3)">(3)
  <M>For the purposes of this section, the term "convicted" or

  payment of a penalty assessment under the provisions of section
  42-4-1701 shall also be considered a conviction if the summons
  states clearly the points to be assessed for that offense.
  Whenever suspension or revocation of a license is authorized or

  finding of guilty of a violation of a municipal ordinance
  governing a substantially equivalent offense in a city, town, or

    <B>Categorization of alcohol-related driving offenses
    reasonably related to governmental interest.</B>To the extent
    that one might consider as a classification the categorization
    of alcohol-related driving offenses in subsections (1)(g) and
    (1)(i), and § 42-2-202 (2)(a)(I), such classification is
    reasonably related to the expressed governmental interest of
    providing maximum safety for all persons who travel or
    otherwise use the public highway. Heninger v. Charnes, 200
    Colo. 194, 613 P.2d 884 (1980) (decided prior to the 1981

    <P>
    <B>Completion of alcohol education program was not mitigating
    factor</B>to be considered in granting or denial of
    probationary driver's license, but rather was prerequisite for
    application. Hoth v. Charnes, 736 P.2d 1264 (Colo. App.
    1987).</P>
    <P>
    <B>Former subsection (4) of this section required</B>the

    alcohol within a five-year period. Smith v. Dept. of Rev., 793

    <P>
    <B>Probationary license sought pursuant to former subsection
    (4) was properly denied</B>since the original revocation period
    expired for driver twice convicted of driving under the
    influence of alcohol within five years and driver was eligible
    for reinstatement, notwithstanding the fact the revocation
    remained in effect until the driver completed Level II alcohol
    treatment. Smith v. Dept. of Rev., 793 P.2d 611 (Colo. App.
    1990) (decided under law in effect prior to 1990 repeal and
    reenactment of subsection (4)).</P>
    <P>
    <B>The application of the 1990 amendments to deny a
    probationary license</B>was not unlawful as being retroactive
    in operation or in violation of defendant's vested rights
    because the revocation and probationary license issues were not
    triggered until defendant's criminal convictions occurred after
    the effective date of the 1990 amendments. Rogers v. Dept. of
    Rev., 841 P.2d 369 (Colo. App. 1992).</P>
    <P>
    <B>Indefinite revocation is a remedial action</B>designed to

    <P>
    <B>Notice need not give facts warranting revocation to be
    adequate.</B>The notice received from the division of motor
    vehicles is not defective because it does not give adequate
    notice of the facts warranting revocation unless the driver was
    genuinely surprised. Campbell v. State, 176 Colo. 202, 491 P.2d
    1385 (1971).</P>

    <P>
    <B>Revocation proper even though offenses occurred prior to
    amendment.</B>Application of the mandatory revocation provision
    of subsection (1)(g) is not improper even though only one of
    the offenses upon which the revocation of the license is based
    occurred after the effective date of the 1981 amendment.

    <P>
    <B>There is no due process violation in suspending the driver's

  to determine whether the person's license should be revoked as
  provided in subsection (3) of this section. The executive
  director of the department shall specify to law enforcement
  agencies the form of the affidavit to be used under this
  paragraph (a) and the types of information needed in the
  affidavit and may specify any additional documents or copies of
  documents needed by the department to make its determination in
  addition to the affidavit. The affidavit shall be dated, signed,
  and sworn to by the law enforcement officer under penalty of
  perjury, but need not be notarized or sworn to before any other
  person.</M></P>
  <P N="(5)(b)(I)">(b)
  <N></N>(I)
  <M>A law enforcement officer, on behalf of the department, shall
  personally serve a notice of revocation on a person who is still

  available to the law enforcement officer, the person's license is
  subject to revocation for excess BAC or refusal.</M></P>
  <P N="(5)(b)(II)">(II)
  <M>When a law enforcement officer serves a notice of revocation,
  the law enforcement officer shall take possession of any driver's
  license issued by this state or any other state that the person
  holds. When the law enforcement officer takes possession of a
  valid driver's license issued by this state or any other state,
  the law enforcement officer, acting on behalf of the department,
  shall issue a temporary permit that is valid for seven days after
  the date of issuance.</M></P>

  <M>A copy of the completed notice of revocation form, a copy of

  taken into possession under this section shall be forwarded to
  the department by the law enforcement officer along with an

  in said paragraph (a).</M></P>
  <P N="(5)(b)(IV)">(IV)
  <M>The department shall provide to law enforcement agencies forms
  for notice of revocation and for temporary permits. The law
  enforcement agencies shall use the forms for the notice of

  (5).</M></P>
  <P N="(5)(b)(V)">(V)

  <M></M>
  <B>Initial determination and notice of revocation.</B>(a)
  <M>Upon receipt of an affidavit of a law enforcement officer and
  the relevant documents required by paragraph (a) of subsection
  (5) of this section, the department shall determine whether the
  person's license should be revoked under subsection (3) of this
  section. The determination shall be based upon the information
  contained in the affidavit and the relevant documents submitted
  to the department, and the determination shall be final unless a
  hearing is requested and held as provided in subsection (8) of
  this section. The determination of these facts by the department
  is independent of the determination of a court of the same or
  similar facts in the adjudication of any criminal charges arising
  out of the same occurrence. The disposition of the criminal
  charges shall not affect any revocation under this
  section.</M></P>
  <P N="(6)(b)(I)">(b)
  <N></N>(I)
  <M>If the department determines that the person is subject to
  license revocation, the department shall issue a notice of
  revocation if a notice has not already been served upon the
  person by the law enforcement officer as provided in paragraph
  (b) of subsection (5) of this section. A notice of revocation
  shall clearly specify the reason and statutory grounds for the
  revocation, the effective date of the revocation, the right of
  the person to request a hearing, the procedure for requesting a
  hearing, and the date by which a request for a hearing must be
  made.</M></P>
  <P N="(6)(b)(II)">(II)
  <M>In sending a notice of revocation, the department shall mail
  the notice in accordance with the provisions of section 42-2-119
  (2) to the person at the last-known address shown on the
  department's records, if any, and to any address provided in the
  law enforcement officer's affidavit if that address differs from
  the address of record. The notice shall be deemed received three
  days after mailing.</M></P>
  <P N="(6)(c)">(c)
  <M>If the department determines that the person is not subject to
  license revocation, the department shall notify the person of its
  determination and shall rescind any order of revocation served
  upon the person by the law enforcement officer.</M></P>
  <P N="(6)(d)">(d)
  <M>A license revocation shall become effective seven days after
  the person has received the notice of revocation as provided in
  subsection (5) of this section or is deemed to have received the
  notice of revocation by mail as provided in paragraph (b) of this
  subsection (6). If the department receives a written request for
  a hearing pursuant to subsection (7) of this section within that
  same seven-day period and the department issues a temporary
  permit pursuant to paragraph (d) of subsection (7) of this
  section, the effective date of the revocation shall be stayed
  until a final order is issued following the hearing; except that
  any delay in the hearing that is caused or requested by the

  <P N="(7)(a)">(7)
  <M></M>
  <B>Request for hearing.</B>(a)
  <M>A person who has received a notice of revocation may make a
  written request for a review of the department's determination at
  a hearing. The request may be made on a form available at each
  office of the department.</M></P>
  <P N="(7)(b)">(b)
  <M>A person must request a hearing in writing within seven days
  after the day the person receives the notice of revocation as
  provided in subsection (5) of this section or is deemed to have
  received the notice by mail as provided in paragraph (b) of
  subsection (6) of this section. If the department does not
  receive the written request for a hearing within the seven-day
  period, the right to a hearing is waived, and the determination
  of the department that is based on the documents and affidavit
  required by subsection (5) of this section becomes final.</M></P>
  <P N="(7)(c)">(c)
  <M>If a person submits a written request for a hearing after
  expiration of the seven-day period and if the request is
  accompanied by the person's verified statement explaining the
  failure to make a timely request for a hearing, the department
  shall receive and consider the request. If the department finds
  that the person was unable to make a timely request due to lack
  of actual notice of the revocation or due to factors of physical
  incapacity such as hospitalization or incarceration, the
  department shall waive the period of limitation, reopen the
  matter, and grant the hearing request. In such a case, the
  department shall not grant a stay of the revocation pending
  issuance of the final order following the hearing.</M></P>
  <P N="(7)(d)">(d)
  <M>At the time a person requests a hearing pursuant to this
  subsection (7), if it appears from the record that the person is
  the holder of a valid driver's or minor driver's license or of an
  instruction permit or of a temporary permit issued pursuant to
  paragraph (b) of subsection (5) of this section and that the
  license or permit has been surrendered, the department shall stay
  the effective date of the revocation and issue a temporary permit
  that shall be valid until the scheduled date for the hearing. If
  necessary, the department may later extend the temporary permit
  or issue an additional temporary permit in order to stay the
  effective date of the revocation until the final order is issued
  following the hearing, as required by subsection (8) of this
  section. If the person notifies the department in writing at the
  time that the hearing is requested that the person desires the
  law enforcement officer's presence at the hearing, the department
  shall issue a written notice for the law enforcement officer to
  appear at the hearing. A law enforcement officer who is required
  to appear at a hearing may, at the discretion of the hearing
  officer, appear in real time by telephone or other electronic
  means in accordance with section 42-1-218.5.</M></P>
  <P N="(7)(e)">(e)
  <M>At the time that a person requests a hearing, the department
  shall provide to the person written notice advising the

  <P N="(7)(e)(I)">(I)
  <M>Of the right to subpoena the law enforcement officer for the
  hearing and that the subpoena must be served upon the law
  enforcement officer at least five calendar days prior to the

  <P N="(7)(e)(II)">(II)
  <M>Of the person's right at that time to notify the department in

  notification, the department shall issue a written notice for the
  law enforcement officer to appear at the hearing;</M></P>
  <P N="(7)(e)(III)">(III)
  <M>That, if the law enforcement officer is not required to appear
  at the hearing, documents and an affidavit prepared and submitted

  <M>That the affidavit and documents submitted by the law
  enforcement officer may be reviewed by the person prior to the
  hearing.</M></P>
  <P N="(7)(f)">(f)
  <M>Any subpoena served upon a law enforcement officer for

  <P N="(8)">(8)
  <M></M>
  <B>Hearing.</B>(a)
  <N></N>(I)
  <M>The hearing shall be scheduled to be held as quickly as
  practicable but not more than sixty days after the date the
  department receives the request for a hearing; except that, if a
  hearing is rescheduled because of the unavailability of a law
  enforcement officer or the hearing officer in accordance with
  subsection (8)(a)(III) or (8)(a)(IV) of this section, the hearing
  may be rescheduled more than sixty days after the date the
  department receives the request for the hearing, and the
  department shall continue any temporary driving privileges held
  by the person until the date to which the hearing is rescheduled.
  At least ten days prior to the scheduled or rescheduled hearing,
  the department shall provide in the manner specified in section
  42-2-119 (2) a written notice of the time and place of the
  hearing to the respondent unless the parties agree to waive this
  requirement. Notwithstanding the provisions of sections 42-1-102
  and 42-2-119, the last-known address of the respondent for
  purposes of notice for any hearing pursuant to this section is
  the address stated on the hearing request form.</M></P>
  <P N="(8)(a)(II)">(II)
  <M>A law enforcement officer who submits the documents and
  affidavit required by subsection (5) of this section need not be
  present at the hearing unless the hearing officer requires that
  the law enforcement officer be present and the hearing officer
  issues a written notice for the law enforcement officer's
  appearance or unless the respondent or the respondent's attorney
  determines that the law enforcement officer should be present and
  serves a timely subpoena upon the law enforcement officer in
  accordance with paragraph (f) of subsection (7) of this
  section.</M></P>
  <P N="(8)(a)(III)">(III)
  <M>If a law enforcement officer, after receiving a notice or
  subpoena to appear from either the department or the respondent,
  is unable to appear at the original or rescheduled hearing date
  due to a reasonable conflict, including but not limited to
  training, vacation, or personal leave time, the law enforcement
  officer or the law enforcement officer's supervisor shall contact
  the department not less than forty-eight hours prior to the
  hearing and reschedule the hearing to a time when the law
  enforcement officer will be available. If the law enforcement
  officer cannot appear at the original or rescheduled hearing
  because of medical reasons, a law enforcement emergency, another
  court or administrative hearing, or any other legitimate, just
  cause as determined by the department, and the law enforcement
  officer or the law enforcement officer's supervisor gives notice
  of the law enforcement officer's inability to appear to the
  department prior to the dismissal of the revocation proceeding,
  the department shall reschedule the hearing following
  consultation with the law enforcement officer or the law
  enforcement officer's supervisor at the earliest possible time
  when the law enforcement officer and the hearing officer will be
  available.</M></P>
  <P N="(8)(a)(IV)">(IV)
  <M>If a hearing officer cannot appear at an original or
  rescheduled hearing because of medical reasons, a law enforcement
  emergency, another court or administrative hearing, or any other
  legitimate, just cause, the hearing officer or the department may
  reschedule the hearing at the earliest possible time when the law
  enforcement officer and the hearing officer will be
  available.</M></P>
  <P N="(8)(b)">(b)
  <M>The hearing shall be held in the district office nearest to
  where the violation occurred, unless the parties agree to a
  different location; except that, at the discretion of the

  time, by telephone or other electronic means in accordance with
  section 42-1-218.5.</M></P>
  <P N="(8)(c)">(c)
  <M>The department shall consider all relevant evidence at the
  hearing, including the testimony of any law enforcement officer
  and the reports of any law enforcement officer that are submitted
  to the department. The report of a law enforcement officer shall
  not be required to be made under oath, but the report shall
  identify the law enforcement officer making the report. The
  department may consider evidence contained in affidavits from
  persons other than the respondent, so long as the affidavits
  include the affiant's home or work address and phone number and
  are dated, signed, and sworn to by the affiant under penalty of
  perjury. The affidavit need not be notarized or sworn to before
  any other person.</M></P>
  <P N="(8)(d)">(d)

  <P N="(8)(e)">(e)
  <M>When an analysis of the respondent's BAC is considered at a
  hearing:</M></P>
  <P N="(8)(e)(I)">(I)
  <M>If the respondent establishes, by a preponderance of the
  evidence, that the respondent consumed alcohol between the time
  that the respondent stopped driving and the time of testing, the
  preponderance of the evidence must also establish that the
  minimum required BAC was reached as a result of alcohol consumed
  before the respondent stopped driving; and</M></P>
  <P N="(8)(e)(II)">(II)
  <M>If the evidence offered by the respondent shows a disparity
  between the results of the analysis done on behalf of the law
  enforcement agency and the results of an analysis done on behalf
  of the respondent, and a preponderance of the evidence
  establishes that the blood analysis conducted on behalf of the
  law enforcement agency was properly conducted by a qualified
  person associated with a laboratory certified by the department
  of public health and environment using properly working testing
  devices, there shall be a presumption favoring the accuracy of
  the analysis done on behalf of the law enforcement agency if the
  analysis showed the BAC to be 0.096 or more. If the respondent
  offers evidence of blood analysis, the respondent shall be
  required to state under oath the number of analyses done in
  addition to the one offered as evidence and the names of the
  laboratories that performed the analyses and the results of all
  analyses.</M></P>
  <P N="(8)(f)">(f)
  <M>The hearing shall be recorded. The hearing officer shall
  render a decision in writing, and the department shall provide a
  copy of the decision to the respondent.</M></P>
  <P N="(8)(g)">(g)
  <M>If the respondent fails to appear without just cause, the

  <M>Pursuant to section 42-1-228, a driver may challenge the
  validity of the law enforcement officer's initial contact with
  the driver and the driver's subsequent arrest for DUI, DUI per

  enforcement officer's initial contact, and the evidence does not
  establish that the initial contact or arrest was constitutionally
  and statutorily valid, the driver is not subject to license
  revocation.</M></P>
  <P N="(9)(a)">(9)
  <M></M>
  <B>Appeal.</B>(a)
  <M>Within thirty-five days after the department issues its final
  determination under this section, a person aggrieved by the
  determination has the right to file a petition for judicial
  review in the district court in the county of the person's
  residence.</M></P>
  <P N="(9)(b)">(b)
  <M>Judicial review of the department's determination shall be on
  the record without taking additional testimony. If the court
  finds that the department exceeded its constitutional or
  statutory authority, made an erroneous interpretation of the law,
  acted in an arbitrary and capricious manner, or made a
  determination that is unsupported by the evidence in the record,
  the court may reverse the department's determination.</M></P>
  <P N="(9)(c)">(c)
  <M>A filing of a petition for judicial review shall not result in
  an automatic stay of the revocation order. The court may grant a
  stay of the order only upon a motion and hearing and upon a
  finding that there is a reasonable probability that the person
  will prevail upon the merits.</M></P>
  <P N="(10)">(10)
  <M></M>
  <B>Notice to vehicle owner.</B>If the department revokes a
  person's license pursuant to paragraph (a), (c), or (d) of
  subsection (3) of this section, the department shall mail a
  notice to the owner of the motor vehicle used in the violation
  informing the owner that:</P>
  <P N="(10)(a)">(a)
  <M>The motor vehicle was driven in an alcohol-related driving
  violation; and</M></P>
  <P N="(10)(b)">(b)
  <M>Additional alcohol-related violations involving the motor

    driving a motor vehicle while impaired by the consumption of

    <P>
    <B>The term "drove a vehicle",</B>for the purposes of

    <P>"Actual physical control" does not require that the vehicle
    be moving on its own power or that the vehicle travel a
    particular distance. Therefore, licensee was in actual physical
    control of the vehicle when he was seated behind the wheel,

    <P>The department's determination of the facts with respect to
    administrative revocation is independent of the determination
    of the same or similar facts in the adjudication of any
    criminal charges arising out of the same occurrence. When the
    statutory text evidences a legislative intent to treat
    separately the administrative and criminal consequences of
    driving under the influence of intoxicating liquor, the statute

    1985); Kelley v. Dept. of Rev., 780 P.2d 67 (Colo. App.
    1989).</P>
    <P>When the grounds for an untimely request for a license
    revocation hearing is attorney negligence in failing to request
    a hearing within the statutorily designated time period, the
    trial court erred in ordering the department to grant the
    request. Baulsir v. Dept. of Rev., 702 P.2d 277 (Colo. App.
    1985).</P>
    <P>Due process clause was not violated since adequate advance
    notice and an opportunity for an appropriate hearing before the
    license revocation became effective was given. Baulsir v. Dept.
    of Rev., 702 P.2d 277 (Colo. App. 1985).</P>
    <P>
    <B>Statutory notice provisions require driver to request
    hearing within seven days of time notice is deemed by statute
    to be received,</B>not from time of actual notice. Kelley v.
    Dept. of Rev., 780 P.2d 67 (Colo. App. 1989).</P>
    <P>
    <B>Written notice of right to subpoena law enforcement officer
    is jurisdictional requirement.</B>Where respondent never
    received such notice and department nevertheless held
    revocation hearing in absence of officer over respondent's
    objection, order of revocation was invalid. Kress v. Dept. of
    Rev., 834 P.2d 268 (Colo. App. 1992).</P>
    <P>
    <B>If respondent requests that the law enforcement officer be
    present, the officer cannot fulfill this statutory requirement
    by appearing via two-way video conference.</B>The term
    "presence" requires actual presence not video presence. Barnes
    v. Colo. Dept. of Rev., 23 P.3d 1235 (Colo. App. 2000).</P>
    <P>
    <B>Department's policy of never granting a rescheduling request
    by a licensee or counsel for an alternative date within the
    60-day limit is arbitrary, capricious, and inconsistent with
    the statutory obligation to provide a meaningful opportunity
    for a fair hearing.</B>Such policy effectively violated
    licensee's right to counsel of her own choosing when counsel
    made the request due to a scheduling conflict. However, the
    department is not required to accommodate every request for
    rescheduling; it must take the circumstances surrounding the
    request into consideration. Erbe v. Colo. Dept. of Rev., 51
    P.3d 1096 (Colo. App. 2002).</P>
    <P>
    <B>Subsection (9)(c) provides the grounds for reversing a DMV
    revocation order.</B>Where analysis of licensee's blood alcohol
    content was conflicting, it was the hearing officer's role, not
    the role of the reviewing court, to determine which test result
    was more reliable and deserved greater weight. Therefore, the
    hearing officer's decision to rely on one of two conflicting
    test results did not constitute grounds for reversal under the
    statute. Charnes v. Lobato, 743 P.2d 27 (Colo. 1987).</P>
    <P>
    <B>The presumption of accuracy described in subsection
    (9)(c)(II) applies only to revocation hearings and not to
    "persistent drunk driver" determinations.</B>Given the clear
    statutory language, it is apparent that the general assembly
    intended the presumption of accuracy in blood alcohol content
    to apply to the limit required for license revocation.
    Conversely, there is no indication that it intended the
    presumption of accuracy in blood alcohol content to apply to
    the "persistent drunk driver" section of the statute. Wiesner
    v. Huber, 228 P.3d 973 (Colo. App. 2010) (decided under law in
    effect prior to 2008 amendment).</P>

    residence, and a petition filed by a nonresident of the county
    must be dismissed. Dept. of Rev. v. Borquez, 751 P.2d 639
    (Colo. 1988).</P>
    <P>
    <B>Absence of transcript.</B>Under this section the record does
    not include the transcript. Destruction of transcript due to
    administrative practice, standing alone, does not require
    reversal of department's decision. Cop v. Charnes, 738 P.2d
    1200 (Colo. App. 1987).</P>
    <P>Nor does absence of transcript due to accidental erasure of
    the tape, standing alone, require reversal of the department's

    <P>
    <B>The hearing officer is the trier of fact.</B>Determinations
    concerning witness credibility, evidentiary weight, and the
    resolution of any evidentiary conflicts are factual matters
    solely within the province of the hearing officer as the trier
    of fact. Haney v. Colo. Dept. of Rev., 2015 COA 125, 361 P.3d

    <P>
    <B>District court erred in substituting its judgment for

    refusal to submit to testing</B>when hearing officer's finding

    <P>
    <B>A request for extraordinary relief in the form of mandamus

    by the department of revenue</B>in revoking a person's driver's
    license, even though petition was filed on the basis that the
    department refused to conduct a revocation hearing. The APA
    provides the proper mechanism for seeking relief based on

    <P>
    <B>The department's authority is limited by pertinent statutory
    provisions in a driver's license revocation proceeding</B>and,
    absent any statutory authorization for a "reopening", the
    asserted right thereto was a nullity and plaintiff was not
    required to "exhaust" such an invalid administrative "remedy"
    as a condition precedent to his statutory right to seek
    judicial review of the department's final order of revocation.
    Foos v. State, 888 P.2d 321 (Colo. App. 1994).</P>
    <P>
    <B>Under the applicable statutory scheme, the final agency
    action of the department that is subject to judicial review in
    express consent revocation proceedings</B>is the issuance of
    the final order of revocation by the hearing officer at the
    conclusion of the revocation hearing. Foos v. State, 888 P.2d
    321 (Colo. App. 1994).</P>

    <P>
    <B>On remand, the district court's disposition of the judicial

    <P>
    <B>Court has no subject matter jurisdiction to review the

    remedies before seeking judicial review. Kriz v. Colo. Dept. of
    Rev., 916 P.2d 659 (Colo. App. 1996).</P>
    <P>
    <B>Failure to file a petition for judicial review within 30
    days after issuance of a revocation order is a jurisdictional
    defect that mandates dismissal of the action</B>where, as here,
    the statute does not mandate the filing of a petition for
    reconsideration; therefore, it was error for the district court
    to affirm the revocation order. Jeffries v. Fisher, 66 P.3d 218
    (Colo. App. 2003).</P>
    <P>
    <B>Remedy for driver who has had his driver's license revoked
    or suspended may be available pursuant to § 24-4-105(10) where
    the Colorado department of revenue does not hold an
    administrative hearing prior to the expiration of 60 days</B>as
    the department is under statutory obligation to hold an
    administrative hearing within 60 days under either this section

    1993).</P>
    <P>
    <B>The statutory grounds for delay of the license revocation
    hearing must be strictly construed.</B>The exception that
    arises when a police officer is unavailable must be limited to
    situations involving the same degree of urgency as covered by
    the other enumerated exceptions. A bare notation that the
    officer had to teach school is insufficient to establish the
    applicability of the statutory exception. Rule v. Dept. of
    Rev., 868 P.2d 1166 (Colo. App. 1994).</P>
    <P>
    <B>Officer who submitted the documentation for a DUI arrest was

    <P>
    <B>Reversal of a driver's license revocation</B>is warranted

  <P N="(2)(a)(III)">(III)
  <M>When Indians drive outside of the reservation, state and

  <P N="(2)(b)">(b)
  <M>In enacting this section, the general assembly intends to
  provide safety for all persons using the highways of the state by
  authorizing a process whereby the state shall revoke the Colorado
  driving privileges of a person after the tribe has entered a
  final order under the tribal code revoking the reservation
  driving privileges of that person, in a manner similar to how the
  state revokes the state driving privileges of a Colorado licensee
  whose driving privileges are revoked for an action occurring and
  adjudicated in a foreign jurisdiction.</M></P>
  <P N="(3)">(3)
  <M>When the tribe initially revokes the reservation driving
  privilege of an Indian pursuant to the tribal code pending a

  revocation of the person's reservation driving
  privileges.</M></P>

  revocation of the reservation driving privileges of an
  Indian.</M></P>
  <P N="(6)">(6)
  <M>Upon receiving notice of revocation from the tribe pertaining
  to any Indian, the department shall immediately revoke the
  Colorado driving privileges of that person. The period of the
  state revocation shall run concurrently with the revocation
  action taken by the tribe. The state's driver record for the

  Because the state is giving full faith and credit to the tribal
  determination, the department's revocation action shall be
  affirmed if, upon review, the reviewing court determines that the
  tribe's revocation of tribal driving privileges met both of the
  following conditions:</M></P>
  <P N="(7)(a)">(a)

  <M>When a person whose license is revoked under this section has

  written notification of the completion, the person may seek
  reinstatement of his or her Colorado driving privileges. The

  <N></N>(a)
  <M>Except as provided in paragraph (b) of subsection (8) of this
  section, the department has the authority to suspend the license
  of any driver who, in accordance with the schedule of points set
  forth in this section, has been convicted of traffic violations
  resulting in the accumulation of twelve points or more within any
  twelve consecutive months or eighteen points or more within any
  twenty-four consecutive months, or, in the case of a minor driver
  eighteen years of age or older, who has accumulated nine points
  or more within any twelve consecutive months, or twelve points or
  more within any twenty-four consecutive months, or fourteen
  points or more for violations occurring after reaching the age of
  eighteen years, or, in the case of a minor driver under the age
  of eighteen years, who has accumulated more than five points
  within any twelve consecutive months or more than six points for
  violations occurring prior to reaching the age of eighteen years;
  except that the accumulation of points causing the subjection to
  suspension of the license of a chauffeur who, in the course of
  employment, has as a principal duty the operation of a motor
  vehicle shall be sixteen points in one year, twenty-four points
  in two years, or twenty-eight points in four years, if all the
  points are accumulated while said chauffeur is in the course of
  employment. Any provision of this section to the contrary
  notwithstanding, the license of a chauffeur who is convicted of
  DUI, DUI per se, DWAI, UDD, or leaving the scene of an accident
  shall be suspended in the same manner as if the offense occurred
  outside the course of employment. Whenever a minor driver under
  the age of eighteen years receives a summons for a traffic
  violation, the minor's parent or legal guardian or, if the minor
  is without parents or guardian, the person who signed the minor
  driver's application for a license shall immediately be notified
  by the court from which the summons was issued.</M>
  <P N="(1)(b)">(b)
  <M>If any applicant for a license to operate a motor vehicle has
  illegally operated a motor vehicle in this state prior to the
  issuance of a valid driver's or minor driver's license or

  application, the department has the authority to deny the
  issuance of said license for not more than twelve months.</M></P>

  <M>No suspension or denial shall be made until a hearing has been
  held or the driver has failed to appear for a hearing scheduled

    as it existed prior to the 1994 amending of title 42 as enacted
    by SB 94-1 and to repealed § 13-4-23, C.R.S. 1963, and to §
    13-3-24, CRS 53, relevant cases construing these provisions
    have been included in the annotations to this section.</P>
    <P>
    <B>Portion of section authorizing suspension of license held
    constitutional.</B>Portion of this section which grants the
    motor vehicle division authority to suspend the driver's
    license of any operator who has accumulated "twelve points
    within any twelve consecutive months, or eighteen points within
    any twenty-four consecutive months" is not overbroad, vague, or
    indefinite. Zaba v. Motor Vehicle Div., 183 Colo. 335, 516 P.2d
    634 (1973).</P>
    <P>
    <B>Portion of section severable.</B>The portion of this section
    dealing with suspension of licenses is complete in itself and
    independent of the portion of the statute dealing with
    probationary licenses; the two provisions are severable.
    Elizondo v. State, Dept. of Rev., 194 Colo. 113, 570 P.2d 518
    (1977).</P>
    <P>
    <B>Classification of 18- to 21-year-olds not violative of equal
    protection.</B>Where licensees assert that they have been
    denied the equal protection of the laws in violation of the
    fourteenth amendment because Colorado allows drivers in the age
    group of 18 to 21 years to accumulate only eight points prior
    to suspension, while drivers over 21 years are allowed 12
    points before their licenses are suspended, and further assert
    that there is no reasonable relationship to the public health,
    safety, and welfare of Colorado in the different treatment,
    statistical analyses of all accidents in Colorado in 1973,
    analyzed by age, fully justifies the different treatment
    mandated by the general assembly, and these figures clearly
    support the determination by the general assembly that drivers
    in the lower age groups demand closer supervision, to protect
    the public health and safety. Lopez v. Motor Vehicle Div., 189
    Colo. 133, 538 P.2d 446 (1975).</P>
    <P>
    <B>Nonresident licensees assert that it is unreasonable for
    Colorado to treat them differently from their states of
    residence</B>where they are allowed the same driving privileges
    as older drivers, but, as repeatedly pointed out, the use of
    Colorado highways is a privilege strictly governed by statute,
    and it has not been demonstrated that the general assembly was
    in any way unreasonable or arbitrary in its classification.
    Lopez v. Motor Vehicle Div., 189 Colo. 133, 538 P.2d 446
    (1975).</P>

    <B>Subsection (1)(a) of this section is
    constitutional.</B>Keegan v. State, 194 Colo. 325, 571 P.2d
    1110 (1977).</P>
    <P>
    <B>Higher point allocation for chauffeurs not
    unconstitutional.</B>The legislative decision to accord
    chauffeurs as a class a higher point allocation than that given
    to the "regular driver" cannot be viewed as so lacking a
    reasonable basis in fact as to render the statutory
    classification constitutionally flawed. Smith v. Charnes, 649
    P.2d 1089 (Colo. 1982).</P>
    <P>
    <B>Statutes enacted by the general assembly in the exercise of
    its police power must be strictly construed</B>and are not to
    be extended by implication; accordingly, an operator's license,
    once issued, is not to be revoked arbitrarily but only in the
    manner provided by law. Cave v. Colo. Dept. of Rev., 31 Colo.
    App. 185, 501 P.2d 479 (1972).</P>
    <P>
    <B>Revocation proceeding is civil.</B>The administrative
    proceeding to revoke the driver's license of a habitual
    offender is a civil proceeding. State v. Laughlin, 634 P.2d 49
    (Colo. 1981).</P>
    <P>
    <B>This section does not constitute an unreasonable exercise of
    the police power,</B>since an individual's right to use the
    highways of the state is an adjunct of the constitutional right
    to acquire, possess, and protect property. Zaba v. Motor
    Vehicle Div., 183 Colo. 335, 516 P.2d 634 (1973).</P>
    <P>
    <B>This section does not unconstitutionally delegate
    legislative power.</B>Since the overall statutory scheme, of
    which the probationary license provision is a part, provides
    sufficient general standards to guide its application and
    contains adequate safeguards against administrative abuse, this
    section is not on its face an unconstitutional delegation of
    legislative power. Elizondo v. State, Dept. of Rev., 194 Colo.
    113, 570 P.2d 518 (1977).</P>

    <B>This section is not unconstitutionally vague.</B>Perlmutter
    v. State, Dept. of Rev., 191 Colo. 517, 554 P.2d 691
    (1976).</P>
    <P>
    <B>The obvious purpose of this section</B>is to protect the
    safety of the public. Perlmutter v. State, Dept. of Rev., 191
    Colo. 517, 554 P.2d 691 (1976).</P>
    <P>The primary purpose of this section and sections §§ 42-2-121
    and 42-2-122 is to protect the public safety upon the highways.
    Heil v. Charnes, 44 Colo. App. 225, 616 P.2d 980 (1980).</P>
    <P>This section is designed to protect the welfare and safety
    of the public and must be construed to further that legislative
    purpose. Livengood v. Dept. of Rev., 44 Colo. App. 431, 614
    P.2d 908 (1980).</P>
    <P>
    <B>Legislative intent.</B>Legislative history clearly
    demonstrates that it was the intent of the general assembly to
    authorize the motor vehicle division to consider that period of
    time ending with the date of the last violation involved. Zaba
    v. Motor Vehicle Div., 183 Colo. 335, 516 P.2d 634 (1973);
    Perlmutter v. State, Dept. of Rev., 191 Colo. 517, 554 P.2d 691
    (1976).</P>
    <P>The general assembly did not intend by this section to
    empower the motor vehicle division to delve back into the
    driving history of any operator for the purpose of suspending
    his license. Zaba v. Motor Vehicle Div., 183 Colo. 335, 516
    P.2d 634 (1973).</P>
    <P>The legislative intent was to authorize two suspensions in
    an instance where during the first year the driver accumulated
    12 points and in the second year the driver accumulated 6 more
    points. Perlmutter v. State, Dept. of Rev., 191 Colo. 517, 554
    P.2d 691 (1976).</P>
    <P>
    <B>Suspension of license authorized upon accumulation of 12
    points in one year.</B>Subsection (1) authorizes the department
    of revenue to suspend the license of any operator who has been
    convicted of traffic violations resulting in accumulation of 12
    points in one year. Theobald v. District Court, 148 Colo. 466,
    366 P.2d 563 (1961); Markham v. Theobald, 152 Colo. 540, 383
    P.2d 791 (1963).</P>
    <P>
    <B>The word "year" must be interpreted as a year tied to the
    expiration date of the license,</B>this being referred to as an
    "anniversary license year". Markham v. Theobald, 152 Colo. 540,
    383 P.2d 791 (1963).</P>
    <P>
    <B>Suspension of license authorized.</B>This section
    establishes a basic rule that any operator or chauffeur is
    subject to license suspension if he is convicted of traffic
    violations which result in the accumulation of 12 points within
    any 12 consecutive months. Edwards v. Motor Vehicle Div., 33
    Colo. App. 382, 520 P.2d 598 (1974).</P>
    <P>
    <B>Section contains a limited exception for chauffeurs</B>which
    allows them to accumulate a maximum of 16 points in one year
    subject, however, to the proviso that "all such points are
    accumulated while said chauffeur is in the course of his
    employment". Edwards v. Motor Vehicle Div., 33 Colo. App. 382,
    520 P.2d 598 (1974).</P>
    <P>
    <B>Where all of the violations and the resulting points did not
    occur within the course of chauffeur's employment,</B>the
    16-point exception is not applicable. Edwards v. Motor Vehicle
    Div., 33 Colo. App. 382, 520 P.2d 598 (1974).</P>
    <P>
    <B>Thus, suspension of license not subject to abuse of
    discretion.</B>Where evidence is clear and demonstrates that
    chauffeur has more than enough points to justify suspension of
    license, suspension of license is ministerial act, discharge of
    which is not subject to abuse of discretion. Michels v. Motor
    Vehicle Div. of Dept. of Rev., 32 Colo. App. 106, 506 P.2d 1243
    (1973); Mitchell v. Charnes, 656 P.2d 719 (Colo. App.
    1982).</P>
    <P>The suspension of drivers' licenses, being based on a point
    system, involves no discretion on the part of an administrator
    and therefore is not subject to abuse of discretion. Elizondo
    v. State, Dept. of Rev., 194 Colo. 113, 570 P.2d 518
    (1977).</P>
    <P>
    <B>Suspension of license based upon the point system is not
    subject to abuse of discretion.</B>Ryan v. Charnes, 738 P.2d
    1175 (Colo. 1987).</P>
    <P>
    <B>The department is authorized to suspend the driver's license
    of any person who has been "convicted" of traffic violations
    resulting in the accumulation of excessive points,</B>but
    points cannot be assessed until after "conviction" for such
    traffic violations. Jackson v. Dept. of Rev., 791 P.2d 1206
    (Colo. App. 1990).</P>
    <P>
    <B>Department is vested with discretionary authority</B>to
    determine length of period of suspension and whether to grant a
    probationary license. Elkins v. Charnes, 682 P.2d 70 (Colo.
    App. 1984).</P>
    <P>
    <B>No violation of due process.</B>Section 42-4-1510 and this
    section give a licensee notice of the ramifications of his
    failure to appear, and the forfeiture of his bond for traffic
    violation charge and due process requirements are satisfied.
    Lopez v. Motor Vehicle Div., 189 Colo. 133, 538 P.2d 446
    (1975).</P>
    <P>
    <B>Violation of § 42-4-1406 included in term "leaving scene of
    accident".</B>The general assembly intended that a violation of
    § 42-4-1406 be included within the meaning of the term "leaving
    scene of accident" as used in this section. Gammon v. State
    Dept. of Rev., 32 Colo. App. 437, 513 P.2d 748 (1973).</P>
    <P>
    <B>Notification of nonresident offenders constitutional.</B>The
    methods used to notify purported nonresident traffic offenders
    are not so unconstitutionally deficient as to violate equal
    protection or due process rights. Klingbeil v. State, Dept. of
    Rev., 668 P.2d 930 (Colo. 1983).</P>
    <P>
    <B>Minimum standard mandated for use of penalty assessment as
    conviction.</B>Through the provisions of § 42-2-121 (3), the
    general assembly has mandated a minimum standard of due process
    which must be followed before payment of a penalty assessment
    may be used as a conviction for purposes of suspension or
    revocation of a driver's license pursuant to subsection (1)(a).
    Stortz v. Colo. Dept. of Rev., 195 Colo. 325, 578 P.2d 229
    (1978).</P>
    <P>
    <B>Points not assessable.</B>If a traffic violation does not
    appear on the summons, and the offender is not advised by the
    arresting officer in reference to the points chargeable for the
    traffic violation, points cannot be assessed against him for
    that offense. Stortz v. Colo. Dept. of Rev., 195 Colo. 325, 578
    P.2d 229 (1978).</P>
    <P>
    <B>Summons need not reflect assessable points.</B>Where a
    conviction is the result of a court appearance, not of a
    penalty assessment, the summons need not reflect the number of
    points to be assessed for the offense charged; the statutory
    provision which requires that a summons reflect the number of
    points relates only to penalty assessments under §
    42-4-1501(4)(a). Purcell v. Tomasi, 43 Colo. App. 540, 608 P.2d
    844 (1980).</P>
    <P>
    <B>Due process requirements.</B>Due process requires that the
    department of revenue promulgate rules or regulations to guide
    hearing officers in their decisions regarding requests for
    probationary licenses. These rules and regulations must be
    sufficiently specific to inform the public what factors will be
    considered relevant by department hearing officers, and they

    four-point offense, and with respect to this charge, the record
    indicated only that $15 was paid on September 26, 1974, to the
    Golden municipal court clerk, proof of payment of $15, even if
    it were assumed that it had been to pay a fine, did not prove

    <P>
    <B>The general assembly decriminalized various state law
    traffic violations in 1982,</B>and, in doing so, subsection

    <P>
    <B>A default judgment entered by a municipal court for a civil
    traffic infraction under municipal law does not constitute a
    "conviction" for purposes of assessing points and authorizing a
    license suspension.</B>The clause "or under the similar
    provisions of any town or city ordinance," which follows the
    provisions regarding penalty assessments under state law in
    subsection (6)(a), does not follow the provisions added in 1982
    regarding judgments for civil traffic infractions under state
    law. It cannot be presumed that this omission was unintentional
    or without significance. Jackson v. Dept. of Rev., 791 P.2d

    <B>Proof of knowledge of revocation order.</B>The prosecution
    is required to prove the element of knowledge of the revocation
    order in a driving after judgment prohibited case, as mailing
    notice of the order is only prima facie proof of its receipt
    under subsection (12), and is not conclusive. People v. Lesh,

    <P>
    <B>The 60-day time limit under subsection (12) is, on its face,

    <P>
    <B>Construing the pertinent time limitation to be mandatory
    would divest the Department of jurisdiction to suspend or
    revoke any license</B>if that limitation were violated, even if
    no prejudice was occasioned by such violation and, absent
    explicit language revealing such, we decline to assume that the

    <P>
    <B>Unlike the time limit for hearings under § 42-2-122.1
    (7)(e), the 60-day time limit in § 42-2-123 (12) is not
    mandatory</B>and, consequently, if no claim of actual prejudice
    resulting from the delay is established, the department does
    not lose jurisdiction over the habitual offender revocation
    proceedings or the points suspension proceedings simply because
    the requested hearing is scheduled beyond the 60-day period.

    <B>Probationary license must be issued unless department makes
    finding of unfitness.</B>Where the department makes no finding
    that the applicant for a probationary license is "unsafe for
    driving for any purpose", and the basis for the suspension is,
    at least in part, an alcohol-related offense, subsection (13)
    requires the department to grant the probationary license. In

    <P>
    <B>Applicability of subsection (13).</B>Subsection (13) applies

    <P>
    <B>Subsection (13) inapplicable to plea-bargained

    that he is entitled to the protection of subsection (13)(a),
    when seeking a probationary license. Schmidt v. Colo. Dept. of

    <P>
    <B>In determining whether motorist's license should be

    revenue did not err in considering both the municipal court
    conviction and the traffic points resulting therefrom. Fuller

    (1979).</P>

    <P>
    <B>Applicant's need for probationary license is one
    factor.</B>The need of an applicant for a probationary license
    during a period of suspension is only one factor to be
    considered by the hearing officer, and it was not error for
    hearing officer to deny a probationary license based on
    applicant's repeated driving convictions. Fisher v. Jorgensen,
    674 P.2d 1003 (Colo. App. 1983).</P>
    <P>
    <B>The benefits of amendatory legislation do not apply to
    driver's license revocation proceedings</B>because revocation
    of a driver's license is a civil, not criminal, matter.
    Dellovade v. Charnes, 633 P.2d 531 (Colo. App. 1981).</P>
    <P>The general rule in civil proceedings regarding amendatory
    legislation is that civil liability already incurred may not be
    changed by statute unless specifically so provided by the
    general assembly. Dellovade v. Charnes, 633 P.2d 531 (Colo.
    App. 1981).</P>
    <P>
    <B>Basis for suspensions.</B>Where, in the 24-month period
    preceding April 16, 1972, the date on which appellant committed
    traffic violations for which he was subsequently convicted, the
    only points accumulated by him were during the four months
    ending with April 16, 1972, the only possible basis for his
    first suspension was the acquisition of 12 points during the
    12-month period ending with April 16, 1972, and where, during
    the year immediately succeeding April 16, 1972, he was awarded
    7 more points, he was subject to a second suspension of his
    license for 18 or more points resulting from violations
    occurring in a 24-month period. Perlmutter v. State, Dept. of
    Rev.,191 Colo. 517, 554 P.2d 691 (1976).</P>
    <P>
    <B>The language of subsection (13)(a) is unambiguous</B>and the
    denial by the department of revenue of plaintiff's application
    for a second probationary license was proper because issuance
    of a second probationary license within a five-year period is
    prohibited regardless of whether alcohol-related offenses were
    involved. Howard v. Colo. Dept. of Rev., 680 P.2d 1336 (Colo.
    App. 1984).</P>
    <P>
    <B>Section permits no "grace period"</B>within which a person

    vehicle without concern for the effect such earlier violations
    may have on his right to continue to drive. Livengood v. Dept.
    of Rev., 44 Colo. App. 431, 614 P.2d 908 (1980).</P>
    <P>
    <B>Only in original suspension hearing may department grant

    <P>
    <B>Suspensions ending seven years prior in time not considered
    in probationary license hearing.</B>For the purpose of
    examining one's driving history in appraising an application
    for a probationary license, the department may not consider any
    suspension in which the ordered period has ended prior to seven
    years before the hearing. Edwards v. State, Dept. of Rev., 42
    Colo. App. 52, 592 P.2d 1345 (1978).</P>
    <P>
    <B>Department may allow review of seven-year record when
    processing probationary license.</B>The department has not
    exceeded its authority by allowing the hearing officer to
    consider the licensee's record for a period of seven years when
    processing a probationary license request even though this
    section sets 24 months as the maximum period for which point
    accumulations are to be examined in determining whether a
    license should be suspended. Peshel v. Motor Vehicle Div., 43
    Colo. App. 58, 602 P.2d 875 (1979).</P>
    <P>
    <B>Validity of probationary license.</B>A probationary license,
    issued during a period of suspension, is valid until the
    licensee pays the restoration fee to get back his driver's
    license because the period of suspension continues until the
    restoration fee is paid, unless the expiration date of the
    probationary license is noted on that license. Seigneur v.

    <P>
    <B>Review of denial of probationary license limited.</B>Where

  If the department finds that the person was unable to make a
  timely request due to lack of actual notice of the suspension,
  factors of physical incapacity such as hospitalization, or
  incarceration, the department shall waive the period of

  evidence at the hearing, including the reports of other officers
  that are submitted to the department. The reports of other

  report must identify the officer making the report. The
  department may consider evidence contained in affidavits from
  persons other than the person requesting the hearing, so long as
  each such affidavit includes the affiant's home or work address
  and telephone number and is dated, signed, and sworn to by the
  affiant under penalty of perjury. The affidavit need not be

  bodily injury to or death of any person and failed to immediately
  stop the vehicle at the scene of the accident, or as close to the
  scene as possible, or immediately return to the scene of the
  accident as required by section 42-4-1601. If the presiding
  hearing officer finds in the affirmative on that issue, the
  suspension order shall be sustained and the presiding hearing
  officer shall then consider whether or not to issue a

  <P N="(8)(b)">(b)
  <M>Judicial review shall be based on the record without taking

  exceeded its constitutional or statutory authority, made an
  erroneous interpretation of the law, acted in an arbitrary and

  the evidence in the record, the court may reverse the
  department's determination.</M></P>
  <P N="(8)(c)">(c)
  <M>The filing of a petition for judicial review does not result
  in an automatic stay of the suspension order. The court may grant
  a stay of the order only upon motion and hearing and upon a
  finding that there is a reasonable probability that the person
  will prevail on the merits and that the person will suffer
  irreparable harm if the order is not stayed.</M></P>
  <P N="(9)">(9)
  <M>A presiding hearing officer may issue a probationary license
  for a period not to exceed the period of suspension for the
  purpose of driving for reasons of employment, education, health,
  or other necessities as determined by the presiding hearing
  officer, which license may contain such restrictions as the
  department deems reasonable and necessary and which may
  thereafter be subject to cancellation as a result of any
  violation of the restrictions imposed therein. The presiding
  hearing officer may refuse to issue a probationary license if the
  department finds that aggravating circumstances exist to indicate
  the individual is unsafe for driving for any purpose. In refusing
  to issue a probationary license, the department shall make
  specific findings of fact to support such refusal. Such
  aggravating circumstances must be matters other than the facts
  and circumstances of the case giving rise to suspension under
  this section.</M></P>

    <P>
    <B>Driving status of "denied" continues until conditions
    met.</B>Before a person against whom an order of denial has
    been entered is entitled to operate a motor vehicle, he must
    reapply for a new license at the end of the period of denial,
    pay the restoration fee required by subsection (3), file proof
    of financial responsibility as required by § 42-7-406(1), and
    must be in receipt and possession of the new license. Unless
    and until these conditions are satisfied, his driving status as
    "denied" continues and he is subject to prosecution under §
    42-2-130(1)(a) for driving under denial. People v. Lessar, 629

  reporting periods, the department shall extend the interlock
  restriction on the person's license for an additional twelve
  months after the expiration of the existing interlock
  restriction. The department shall notify the person that the

  <B>Approved ignition interlock device definition - rules.</B>(a)
  <M>For the purposes of this section, "approved ignition interlock
  device" means a device approved by the department of public
  health and environment that is installed in a motor vehicle and
  that measures the breath alcohol content of the driver before a
  vehicle is started and that periodically requires additional
  breath samples during vehicle operation. The device may not allow
  a motor vehicle to be started or to continue normal operation if
  the device measures an alcohol level above the level established
  by the department of public health and environment.</M></P>
  <P N="(9)(b)">(b)

  operation of a motor vehicle equipped with an approved ignition
  interlock device and who operates a motor vehicle other than a
  motor vehicle equipped with an approved ignition interlock device
  or who circumvents or attempts to circumvent the proper use of an
  approved ignition interlock device commits a class 1 traffic
  misdemeanor.</M></P>
  <P N="(10)(b)">(b)
  <M>If a peace officer issues a citation pursuant to paragraph (a)
  of this subsection (10), the peace officer shall immediately
  confiscate the offending driver's license, shall file an incident
  report on a form provided by the department, and shall not permit
  the driver to continue to operate the motor vehicle.</M></P>
  <P N="(10)(c)">(c)
  <M>A court shall not accept a plea of guilty to another offense
  from a person charged with a violation of paragraph (a) of this
  subsection (10); except that the court may accept a plea of
  guilty to another offense upon a good-faith representation by the
  prosecuting attorney that the attorney could not establish a
  prima facie case if the defendant were brought to trial on the
  offense.</M></P>

    <B>Court may not nullify limitation on right to postpone
    suspension.</B>Where the general assembly, in the interest of
    public safety, has provided a reasonable limitation upon the
    right to secure postponement of the effective date of
    suspension of a driver's license by the director of revenue,
    requiring a showing of irreparable injury, the courts have no
    power to nullify by procedural rule the limitations so imposed,
    the function of the courts being limited to a review of the

    has no discretion whatever to determine that a driver has a
    right to a postponement of the effective date of a suspension
    order even though he makes no showing of irreparable injury.
    The only discretion the district court has under these
    circumstances is to determine whether "irreparable injury"
    would result if the director's order remains in effect pending
    review. Where no showing whatever is made on this question,
    there is nothing before the district court upon which its
    discretion could operate. Theobald v. District Court, 148 Colo.

    <P>
    <B>Court's allowance of injunction would be in derogation of
    department's constitutional authority.</B>By virtue of the
    authority of the constitution, it is the duty of the department
    of revenue to carry into effect the provisions of the revenue
    law which it is required to execute. They are of a governmental
    character. The sole object of the action commenced in the
    district court is to obtain an injunction to restrain the
    department from performing its duties. If this should be
    permitted in a direct proceeding, the result would be to
    directly subject executive officials to the jurisdiction of the
    courts when acting within their province and strip them of
    their constitutional powers. This is an authority that the
    judicial department cannot exercise in this manner, for the
    obvious reason that to concede it would be an assumption that
    the judicial was of superior authority to the executive
    department. Colo. Dept. of Rev. v. District Court ex rel.

    <B>Annotator's note.</B>Since § 42-2-128 is similar to §
    42-2-130 as it existed prior to the 1994 amending of title 42
    as enacted by SB 94-1 and to repealed § 13-3-31, CRS 53,
    relevant cases construing these provisions have been included
    in the annotations to this section. 
    <P>
    <B>Driver may collaterally attack constitutionality</B>of
    uncounseled prior traffic offense convictions underlying the
    administrative order of suspension when prosecuted for driving
    under suspension. People v. Gandy, 685 P.2d 165 (Colo.
    1984)(case arose prior to enactment of § 42-4-1505.3).</P>
    <P>
    <B>This section deals with the subject of driving while license
    is suspended or revoked.</B>Davis v. City &amp; County of
    Denver, 140 Colo. 30, 342 P.2d 674 (1959).</P>
    <P>
    <B>Municipal ordinance dealing with such penalty is
    invalid.</B>Power to establish a licensing system carries with
    it authority to revoke and to penalize the driving of a motor
    vehicle while the license of the operator has been suspended or
    revoked, and the subject being predominately statewide and
    general, a municipal ordinance dealing with the identical
    subject is invalid. Davis v. City &amp; County of Denver, 140
    Colo. 30, 342 P.2d 674 (1959).</P>
    <P>
    <B>Notwithstanding § 43-5-207, recognizing the power of
    municipalities to regulate particular areas of traffic</B>--as
    parking, signal control, one-way streets, speed and traffic at
    intersections--does not specifically authorize such
    municipalities to punish the operator of a vehicle driving
    without a license, this authority has been preempted by the
    state and withheld from a municipality. Davis v. City &amp;
    County of Denver, 140 Colo. 30, 342 P.2d 674 (1959).</P>
    <P>
    <B>Renewing suspension pending hearing where suspension
    terminated violates due process.</B>The practice of renewing
    the suspension of a license, pending a hearing at which
    vacation of the renewed suspension is a certainty, violates due
    process of law. Harris v. Colo., 516 F. Supp. 1128 (D. Colo.
    1981).</P>
    <P>
    <B>Knowledge of fact of revocation is an essential
    element</B>of crime of driving while license revoked. Jolly v.
    People, 742 P.2d 891 (Colo. 1987).</P>
    <P>
    <B>Driving while license is denied, suspended, or
    revoked</B>pursuant to this section and driving after
    revocation pursuant to § 42-2-206 proscribe the same act, and
    defendant may not be convicted or punished under both statutes.
    People v. Rodriguez, 849 P.2d 799 (Colo. App. 1992).</P>
    <P>
    <B>Driving while license denied, suspended, or revoked</B>under
    this section does not merge with § 42-2-206. A person is liable
    to be convicted under both provisions. The elements are
    different because "operating" is a different standard than
    "driving" and "highways" do not include private ways. People v.
    Zubiate, 2013 COA 69, 411 P.3d 757, aff'd, 2017 CO 17, 390 P.3d
    394, (disagreeing with People v. Rodriguez cited above)
    (disapproved by supreme court in People v. Rock, 2017 CO 84,
    402 P.3d 472).</P>
    <P>
    <B>Driving under restraint under this section is a lesser
    included offense of driving after revocation</B>under §
    42-2-206. Although a person may commit driving after revocation
    without committing driving under restraint, a person could not
    commit driving under restraint without committing driving after
    revocation. People v. Wambolt, 2018 COA 88, 431 P.3d 681;
    People v. Tun, 2021 COA 34, 486 P.3d 490.</P>
    <P>The "drive" element of driving under restraint is included
    within the "operate" element of driving after revocation
    because a person who drives a car necessarily operates it.
    People v. Wambolt, 2018 COA 88, 431 P.3d 681.</P>
    <P>
    <B>The department of revenue can impose an additional period of
    revocation under subsection (3) upon receiving an accident
    report</B>for a person who is driving under revocation and
    after finding that the person was driving under restraint at
    the time of the accident. The statute authorizes such
    additional time without a conviction of driving under
    restraint, and such authorization is consistent with the
    remedial nature of the statute. Colo. Dept. of Rev. v. Garner,
    66 P.3d 106 (Colo. 2003).</P>
    <P>
    <B>Driving under restraint charges may be prosecuted only for
    those whose licenses have been suspended, denied, or revoked in
    the state of Colorado.</B>Therefore, charge of driving under
    restraint was dismissed against driver whose Massachusetts
    license was under restraint. Driving without a valid license is
    a lesser included offense of driving under restraint and the
    violation notice could proceed on the charge of driving without
    a license. United States v. Rogers, 865 F. Supp. 718 (D. Colo.
    1994)(decided prior to 1994 repeal and reenactment).</P>
    <P>
    <B>Statute authorizes only a permissive inference of the
    licensee's knowledge</B>of fact of revocation and not a
    conclusive presumption and, therefore, comports with due
    process of law. Jolly v. People, 742 P.2d 891 (Colo. 1987).</P>
    <P>
    <B>Subsection (3) furthers a legitimate governmental
    purpose</B>by penalizing drivers under denial, suspension, or
    revocation who commit additional traffic offenses and does not
    violate equal protection guarantees. Allen v. Charnes, 674 P.2d
    378 (Colo. 1984).</P>
    <P>
    <B>Driving under restraint is a public welfare offense</B>that
    requires actual knowledge or knowledge of circumstances
    sufficient to cause a reasonable person to be aware that such
    person's license to drive was under restraint. People v.
    Ellison, 14 P.3d 1034 (Colo. 2000); People v. Boulden, 2016 COA
    109, 381 P.3d 454.</P>
    <P>
    <B>The second part of the driving under restraint statute that
    requires a reasonable person standard does not violate due
    process of law</B>under the federal and Colorado Constitutions.
    People v. Ellison, 14 P.3d 1034 (Colo. 2000).</P>
    <P>
    <B>Requiring "knowledge" limits punishment to those</B>who are
    subjectively aware of circumstances that would lead a
    responsible driver to realize his or her license was under
    restraint. Thus the "knowledge" requirement encourages a driver
    to monitor his or her infractions on the driving privilege
    hereby advancing the state interest in promoting driver
    responsibility. People v. Ellison, 14 P.3d 1034 (Colo.
    2000).</P>
    <P>
    <B>Section merely permits department to exercise power to renew
    or extend period of suspension.</B>Ewing v. Motor Vehicle Div.,
    624 P.2d 353 (Colo. App. 1980).</P>
    <P>
    <B>Section includes power to extend denials.</B>The power to
    extend suspensions or revocations in subsection (3) also
    includes the power to extend denials. Allen v. Charnes, 674
    P.2d 378 (Colo. 1984).</P>
    <P>
    <B>It does not mandate exercise of discretion by the
    department.</B>Ewing v. Motor Vehicle Div., 624 P.2d 353 (Colo.
    App. 1980).</P>
    <P>
    <B>No distinction between revocation under implied consent and
    order of denial.</B>There is no real distinction, for purposes
    of a prosecution under subsection (1)(a), between a driver
    whose license has been revoked under the implied consent law
    and a person against whom an order of denial has been entered.
    People v. Lessar, 629 P.2d 577 (Colo. 1981).</P>
    <P>
    <B>Five-day jail sentence set forth in subsection
    (1)(a).</B>Subsection (1)(a) sets forth, in unmistakable terms,
    that a five-day jail sentence must be imposed when a defendant
    is convicted of violating this section. People v. Burke, 185
    Colo. 19, 521 P.2d 783 (1974).</P>
    <P>
    <B>The general assembly did not intend to repeal the mandatory
    sentencing provision of this section,</B>sub silentio, by
    implication, or otherwise by enactment of § 16-11-201. People
    v. Burke, 185 Colo. 19, 521 P.2d 783 (1974).</P>
    <P>
    <B>Such provision was retained as additional exception to
    general probation provisions.</B>The driving under suspension
    sentencing requirements in subsection (1)(a) were retained by
    the general assembly as an additional exception to the general
    Colorado statutory probation provisions. People v. Burke, 185
    Colo. 19, 521 P.2d 783 (1974).</P>
    <P>
    <B>County court could not grant probation.</B>Where defendant
    was convicted under this section for driving while his license
    was suspended, and subsection (1)(a) mandated a five-day
    minimum jail sentence to which general statutory probation
    provisions did not apply, a county court could neither impose a
    probationary sentence nor grant probation. People v. Burke, 185
    Colo. 19, 521 P.2d 783 (1974).</P>
    <P>
    <B>Conviction of any motor vehicle offense authorizes extension
    of suspension.</B>Conviction of any motor vehicle offense prior
    to the expiration of a period of suspension is sufficient to
    support an extension of that suspension period by the
    department, pursuant to subsection (3). Conway v. Colo. Dept.
    of Rev., 653 P.2d 411 (Colo. App. 1982).</P>
    <P>The general assembly did not intend to limit the provisions
    of subsection (3) to persons charged or convicted of the
    offense of driving while license suspended. Conway v. Colo.
    Dept. of Rev., 653 P.2d 411 (Colo. App. 1982).</P>
    <P>
    <B>Driving status of "denied" continues until conditions
    met.</B>Before a person against whom an order of denial has
    been entered is entitled to operate a motor vehicle, he must
    reapply for a new license at the end of the period of denial,
    pay the restoration fee required by § 42-2-124 (3), file proof

    <P>
    <B>Section 42-2-202 (2)(b), which identifies "major traffic

    <P>
    <B>Right to counsel.</B>Absent a valid waiver of the right to

    traffic offender status for the purpose of imposing punishment
    for violation of § 42-2-206. People v. Hampton, 619 P.2d 48

    <B>Section is not unconstitutional as violative of equal
    protection,</B>despite the contention that it has created
    classifications providing that habitual traffic offenders be
    subjected to mandatory sentencing, whereas other offenders
    whose conduct is of far greater culpability may be granted
    probation or be given suspended sentences. People v. Scott, 200
    Colo. 365, 615 P.2d 680 (1980). 
    <P>
    <B>Punishment is not cruel and unusual.</B>The punishment
    mandated by this section is not so disparate to the gravity of
    the offense as to constitute cruel and unusual punishment.
    People v. Shaver, 630 P.2d 600 (Colo. 1981).</P>
    <P>
    <B>Procedures upon which prosecutions under section are based
    are fundamentally fair,</B>are adequate to assure an accurate
    determination of habitual traffic offender status, and accord
    due process of law to a licensee later accused of violating
    this section. People v. McKnight, 200 Colo. 486, 617 P.2d 1178
    (1980).</P>
    <P>
    <B>Constitutional standards for voluntary and understanding
    plea of guilty clearly are applicable</B>to the traffic offense
    convictions of driving under suspension. People v. Shaver, 630
    P.2d 600 (Colo. 1981).</P>
    <P>
    <B>Section must be construed to prohibit use of conviction
    obtained without benefit or waiver of counsel</B>as a part of
    the foundation for the sentence of imprisonment which is
    mandated for violation of that statute. People v. Roybal, 618
    P.2d 1121 (Colo. 1980).</P>
    <P>Absent a valid waiver of the right to counsel, a conviction
    obtained against a defendant who is not represented by counsel
    may not be used to establish habitual traffic offender status
    for the purpose of imposing punishment for violation of this
    section. People v. Hampton, 619 P.2d 48 (Colo. 1980); People v.
    Rocha, 650 P.2d 569 (Colo. 1982).</P>
    <P>A violation of a defendant's constitutional right to counsel
    in a traffic offense proceeding can be asserted as a defense in
    a subsequent prosecution for driving after judgment prohibited
    based in essential part upon conviction of that traffic
    offense. People v. Mascarenas, 632 P.2d 1028 (Colo. 1981).</P>
    <P>
    <B>Notification of criminal penalty for violation not
    required.</B>The department is not required to notify persons
    adjudged habitual traffic offenders of the possible criminal
    penalty for driving in violation of the order of revocation.
    People v. Shaver, 630 P.2d 600 (Colo. 1981).</P>
    <P>
    <B>Crim. P. 11(b)(4), not applicable to this section.</B>Where
    defendant's third conviction makes him subject to enhanced
    punishment as an habitual traffic offender under subsection
    (1), the attainment of this status is not a "penalty" within
    the meaning of Crim. P. 11(b)(4), and the defendant does not
    have to be advised of the possible consequences of multiple
    convictions before a court can increase the punishment for his
    attainment thereof. People v. Heinz, 197 Colo. 102, 589 P.2d
    931 (1979).</P>
    <P>
    <B>Although compliance with Crim. P. 11, may be considered by
    court.</B>Compliance with Crim. P. 11, although not conclusive
    of the issue of a defendant's waiver of counsel, is an
    appropriate factor for the court to consider in resolving a
    defendant's challenge to the admission of the order of
    revocation. People v. Shaver, 630 P.2d 600 (Colo. 1981).</P>
    <P>
    <B>Administrative hearing not "critical stage" of
    prosecution.</B>The department of motor vehicles'
    administrative hearing which results in license revocation
    pursuant to § 42-2-203 is not a "critical stage" of the
    prosecution for violation of this section. People v. McKnight,
    200 Colo. 486, 617 P.2d 1178 (1980); People v. Shaver, 630 P.2d
    600 (Colo. 1981).</P>
    <P>
    <B>Driving after revocation pursuant to this section</B>and
    driving while license denied, suspended, or revoked pursuant to
    § 42-2-130 proscribe the same act, and defendant may not be
    convicted or punished under both statutes. People v. Rodriguez,
    849 P.2d 799 (Colo. App. 1992) (decided prior to 1994 amendment
    of title 42).</P>
    <P>
    <B>Driving while license denied, suspended, or revoked</B>under
    this section does not merge with § 42-2-138. A person is liable
    to be convicted under both provisions. The elements are
    different because "operating" is a different standard than
    "driving" and "highways" do not include private ways. People v.
    Zubiate, 2013 COA 69, 411 P.3d 757, aff'd, 2017 CO 17, 390 P.3d
    394 (disagreeing with People v. Rodriguez cited above)
    (disapproved by supreme court in People v. Rock, 2017 CO 84,
    402 P.3d 472).</P>
    <P>
    <B>Driving under restraint under § 42-2-138 is a lesser
    included offense of driving after revocation</B>under this
    section. Although a person may commit driving after revocation
    without committing driving under restraint, a person could not
    commit driving under restraint without committing driving after
    revocation. People v. Wambolt, 2018 COA 88, 431 P.3d 681;
    People v. Tun, 2021 COA 34, 486 P.3d 490.</P>
    <P>The "drive" element of driving under restraint is included
    within the "operate" element of driving after revocation
    because a person who drives a car necessarily operates it.
    People v. Wambolt, 2018 COA 88, 431 P.3d 681.</P>
    <P>
    <B>Eluding or attempting to elude a police officer is a lesser

    <AN-SUB>A.
    <M>In General.</M></AN-SUB>
    <ANNO-TEXT>
    <B>Two elements of crime of driving after judgment prohibited
    are:</B>(1) operation of a motor vehicle in this state; and (2)
    operation of a motor vehicle while the order of revocation of
    the appellant's driver's license as an habitual offender was in
    effect. People v. Moore, 200 Colo. 481, 615 P.2d 726 (1980). 
    <P>
    <B>Proper charge of violation of section must include</B>not
    only an allegation that the license of an accused driver had
    been revoked upon a determination that he was an habitual
    traffic offender but also an allegation that the accused was
    operating a motor vehicle on the highways of this state while
    that revocation was still in effect. People v. Moore, 200 Colo.
    481, 615 P.2d 726 (1980).</P>
    <P>
    <B>Knowledge of revocation order is essential element.</B>As a
    matter of statutory construction, knowledge of the order of
    revocation is an essential element in a driving after judgment
    prohibited prosecution. People v. Lesh, 668 P.2d 1362 (Colo.
    1983); People v. Parga, 964 P.2d 571 (Colo. App. 1998); Griego
    v. People, 19 P.3d 1 (Colo. 2001).</P>
    <P>The prosecution is required to prove the element of
    knowledge of the revocation order in a driving after judgment
    prohibited case, as mailing notice of the order is only prima
    facie proof of its receipt, and is not conclusive. People v.
    Lesh, 668 P.2d 1362 (Colo. 1983).</P>
    <P>
    <B>To satisfy mens rea requirement for conviction on charge of
    felony driving after judgment prohibited, defendant must have
    actual knowledge of habitual traffic offender
    revocation.</B>For purposes of driving after judgment
    prohibited statute, "actual knowledge" is as defined in §
    18-1-501 (6). The constructive knowledge definition contained
    in the misdemeanor driving-under-restraint statute is
    inapplicable to the felony offense of driving after judgment
    prohibited. People v. Parga, 964 P.2d 571 (Colo. App. 1998);
    Griego v. People, 19 P.3d 1 (Colo. 2001).</P>
    <P>
    <B>Defendant's driving record relevant to establish knowledge
    of status as an habitual offender.</B>On retrial, jury may
    consider defendant's record of traffic offenses as
    circumstantial evidence suggesting that he has actual knowledge
    that his license had been revoked as an habitual traffic
    offender. People v. Parga, 964 P.2d 571 (Colo. App. 1998).</P>
    <P>
    <B>Improperly instructing jury on required culpable mental
    state is not harmless error.</B>People v. Parga, 964 P.2d 571
    (Colo. App. 1998).</P>
    <P>
    <B>The mens rea element for the offense of driving after
    judgment is not set forth in this section.</B>However, actual
    knowledge of the order of revocation of license as an habitual
    offender is an essential element of the offense. People v.
    Villa-Villa, 983 P.2d 181 (Colo. App. 1997).</P>
    <P>
    <B>A defendant may be convicted under this section not only if
    he actually knew his license had been revoked but also if</B>a
    reasonable person in the defendant's position would have known
    that his license was under revocation as an habitual offender.
    People v. Villa-Villa, 983 P.2d 181 (Colo. App. 1997).</P>
    <P>
    <B>Inability of a defendant to read and understand English does
    not render the notice of revocation insufficient</B>and does
    not, as a matter of law, constitute a defense to knowledge of
    revocation of driving privileges. People v. Villa-Villa, 983
    P.2d 181 (Colo. App. 1997).</P>
    <P>
    <B>When the documentary evidence included a proof of service,
    dated shortly before the alleged violation, of a notice stating
    that it was unlawful for the defendant to operate a motor
    vehicle and a certified copy of defendant's driving record,
    dated shortly afer the alleged violation, showing that his
    license was under revocation,</B>it was reasonable to conclude
    both that defendant's license was under revocation at the time
    of the alleged violation and that he knew of the revocation.
    People v. Espinoza, 195 P.3d 1122 (Colo. App. 2008).</P>
    <P>
    <B>"Conviction" to include plea of guilty.</B>In enacting §
    42-2-201 et seq., the general assembly was concerned with
    identifying and punishing habitual offenders of traffic laws.
    To give effect to that expressed concern, the definition of the
    term "conviction" must include a plea of guilty. Walker v.
    District Court, 199 Colo. 128, 606 P.2d 70 (1980).</P>
    <P>
    <B>Sentence requirement in this section remains
    mandatory</B>and is not subject to plea bargaining to obtain a
    deferred sentence as generally allowed by § 16-7-403. Walker v.
    District Court, 199 Colo. 128, 606 P.2d 70 (1980).</P>
    <P>
    <B>The term "operate" does not require actual movement of a
    vehicle.</B>"Operate" is the action of causing something to
    occur or to cause to function, usually by direct personal
    effort. People v. Gregor, 26 P.3d 530 (Colo. App. 2000); People
    v. Stewart, 55 P.3d 107 (Colo. 2002); People v. Valdez, 2014
    COA 125, 411 P.3d 94.</P>
    <P>
    <B>The trial court did not err in failing to define "operate"
    for the jury as requiring actual movement</B>because a person
    who is behind the wheel of a car with the engine running is in
    actual physical control of the vehicle and thus driving. People
    v. Gregor, 26 P.3d 530 (Colo. App. 2000).</P>
    <P>
    <B>Operating a motor vehicle means exercising physical control
    over a motor vehicle.</B>The threat that impaired driving
    statutes seek to avoid is that a vehicle will be put into
    motion by an intoxicated occupant and thus pose a risk to the
    safety of the occupant and others. The risk remains present
    when the reason for a vehicle's inoperability is a temporary
    condition that can be quickly remedied. The "reasonably capable
    of being rendered operable" standard distinguishes between a
    vehicle that has simply run out of gas and one that is in a
    condition that renders it "totally inoperable". People v.
    VanMatre, 190 P.3d 770 (Colo. App. 2008).</P>
    <P>
    <B>Prosecution not required to prove the operability of a
    vehicle beyond a reasonable doubt.</B>People v. Valdez, 2014
    COA 125, 411 P.3d 94.</P>
    <P>
    <B>Trial court did not commit plain error</B>in upholding the
    jury's separate convictions for driving under the influence and
    aggravated driving after revocation prohibited offenses and for
    imposing separate sentences for those crimes. People v. Valdez,
    2014 COA 125, 411 P.3d 94.</P></ANNO-TEXT>
    <AN-SUB>B.
    <M>Emergency.</M></AN-SUB>
    <ANNO-TEXT>
    <B>Existence of emergency does not affect criminality</B>of the
    conduct of driving in violation of this section. People v.
    McKnight, 200 Colo. 486, 617 P.2d 1178 (1980). 
    <P>
    <B>Defendant must prove existence of emergency</B>by a
    preponderance of the evidence. People v. McKnight, 200 Colo.
    486, 617 P.2d 1178 (1980).</P>
    <P>
    <B>Trial judge determines existence of emergency.</B>The trial
    judge, and not the jury, must make the determination regarding
    the existence of an emergency. People v. McKnight, 200 Colo.
    486, 617 P.2d 1178 (1980).</P>
    <P>
    <B>The term "emergency" in this section is broader than the
    term used in the statute governing choice of evils
    defense</B>and so the trial court did not abuse its discretion
    by finding that an emergency existed for purposes of sentencing
    after ruling that no emergency existed for purposes of
    disallowing use of a choice of evils defense. People v. Weiser,
    789 P.2d 454 (Colo. App. 1989).</P></ANNO-TEXT>
    <AN-SUB>C.
    <M>Collateral Attack on Prior Conviction.</M></AN-SUB>
    <ANNO-TEXT>
    <B>There is a duty to comply with order of revocation until it
    is rescinded</B>pursuant to a direct appeal rather than a
    collateral attack. People v. District Court, 623 P.2d 55 (Colo.
    1981). 
    <P>
    <B>Section on its face does not preclude collateral
    attack</B>on the underlying traffic convictions. People v.
    Roybal, 618 P.2d 1121 (Colo. 1980).</P>
    <P>
    <B>Defendant may collaterally attack prior convictions when
    later charged</B>with violation of this section. People v.
    DeLeon, 625 P.2d 1010 (Colo. 1981); People v. Shaver, 630 P.2d
    600 (Colo. 1981); People v. Dooley, 630 P.2d 608 (Colo. 1981);
    People v. Swann, 770 P.2d 411 (Colo. 1989).</P>
    <P>
    <B>Bases for collateral attack limited.</B>A defendant cannot
    collaterally attack order of revocation on any bases other than
    lack of jurisdiction or a violation of constitutional
    protections in the proceeding upon which the order was based.
    People v. District Court, 623 P.2d 55 (Colo. 1981).</P>
    <P>
    <B>Unconstitutionally obtained conviction cannot be used in
    later proceeding</B>to support guilt or enhance punishment.
    People v. Roybal, 618 P.2d 1121 (Colo. 1980); People v. Shaver,
    630 P.2d 600 (Colo. 1981); State v. Laughlin, 634 P.2d 49
    (Colo. 1981).</P>
    <P>The order of revocation being an essential element of the
    crime of driving after judgment prohibited, it may not be
    admitted into evidence at trial if the underlying convictions
    supporting the order were obtained in derogation of the
    defendant's constitutional right to counsel. People v. Shaver,
    630 P.2d 600 (Colo. 1981).</P>
    <P>
    <B>Defendant may attack constitutionality of underlying
    conviction.</B>In a criminal proceeding instituted pursuant to
    this section, a defendant may attack the constitutionality of
    his conviction for a traffic offense which provides the basis
    for his habitual traffic offender status. State v. Laughlin,
    634 P.2d 49 (Colo. 1981).</P>
    <P>Where constitutional defects are alleged, defendant may
    challenge convictions supporting his status as an habitual
    traffic offender at his trial for violation of this section.
    People v. Hampton, 619 P.2d 48 (Colo. 1980).</P>
    <P>A defendant charged with driving after judgment prohibited
    has a right to challenge the constitutional validity of the
    traffic offense convictions which underlie that charge. People
    v. Mascarenas, 632 P.2d 1028 (Colo. 1981).</P>
    <P>
    <B>Defendant must make prima facie showing that prior
    conviction is invalid</B>in order to bar the use of that
    conviction in a later proceeding. People v. Roybal, 618 P.2d
    1121 (Colo. 1980); People v. DeLeon, 625 P.2d 1010 (Colo.
    1981).</P>
    <P>The defendant's burden on a challenge to the admission of an
    order of revocation is to make a prima facie showing that one
    or more of the underlying convictions was constitutionally
    invalid. People v. Shaver, 630 P.2d 600 (Colo. 1981); People v.
    Swann, 770 P.2d 411 (Colo. 1989).</P>
    <P>
    <B>What constitutes prima facie showing.</B>A prima facie
    showing in the context of a challenge to the validity of a
    conviction means evidence which, when considered in a light
    most favorable to the defendant and all reasonable inferences
    therefrom are drawn in his favor, would permit the court to
    find that one or more of the traffic offense convictions
    essential to the order of revocation was not obtained in
    accordance with the constitutional right to effective
    assistance of counsel or due process of law. People v. Shaver,
    630 P.2d 600 (Colo. 1981); People v. Mascarenas, 632 P.2d 1028
    (Colo. 1981).</P>
    <P>
    <B>Once prima facie showing that prior conviction is invalid
    has been made,</B>the prosecution has the burden to establish
    that the conviction was constitutionally obtained. People v.
    Roybal, 618 P.2d 1121 (Colo. 1980); People v. DeLeon, 625 P.2d
    1010 (Colo. 1981); People v. Shaver, 630 P.2d 600 (Colo. 1981);
    People v. Mascarenas, 632 P.2d 1028 (Colo. 1981); People v.
    Swann, 770 P.2d 411 (Colo. 1989).</P>
    <P>
    <B>Burden of establishing constitutional validity is by
    preponderance.</B>The appropriate burden for the prosecution is
    to establish the constitutional validity of a traffic
    conviction by a preponderance of the evidence. People v.
    Shaver, 630 P.2d 600 (Colo. 1981).</P>
    <P>
    <B>Burden is distinct from proving guilt beyond reasonable
    doubt.</B>This standard of proof on admissibility of prior
    convictions is to be distinguished from, and does not in any
    manner implicate, the prosecution's burden of proving to the
    jury the defendant's guilt beyond a reasonable doubt on all
    essential elements of the crime charged. People v. Shaver, 630
    P.2d 600 (Colo. 1981).</P>
    <P>
    <B>Failure to make prima facie showing that prior conviction
    invalid.</B>Where defendant fails to present any affirmative
    evidence to show that the defendant's pleas were involuntary or
    without factual basis, or even that the court failed to inquire
    into these matters when accepting his pleas, the defendant has
    failed to make a prima facie showing that a prior conviction
    was invalid. People v. Fleming, 781 P.2d 1384 (Colo. 1989).</P>
    <P>
    <B>No review in criminal proceeding of administrative
    decision.</B>A defendant's right to demonstrate the
    constitutional invalidity of a prior judicial determination of
    guilt does not include the right to obtain judicial review in a
    criminal proceeding of a prior administrative decision
    affecting defendant's status in other context. People v. Rocha,
    669 P.2d 1366 (Colo. 1983).</P>
    <P>
    <B>A defendant charged under this section cannot collaterally
    attack prior uncounseled speeding convictions where</B>he
    failed to raise such issue during driving under suspension
    proceedings based on said speeding convictions. Wilson v.

    <B>The purpose of the act</B>is to make automobile titles more

    obviate the necessity of relying upon circumstantial evidence
    as to the ownership thereof. Blevins v. Truitt, 134 Colo. 88,
    299 P.2d 1100 (1956).</P>
    <P>
    <B>The purpose of requiring the name of the owner in the
    registration of a motor vehicle</B>is for the proper
    identification of the registrant; it follows that a person is
    more readily identified by the name he habitually uses, and a
    regulation which requires an applicant to use a first name
    rather than an initial, which would actually hinder
    identification, contravenes the legislative intent and is
    unlawful. Blevins v. Truitt, 134 Colo. 88, 299 P.2d 1100
    (1956).</P>
    <P>
    <B>Director of revenue not authorized to require registration
    in name not regularly used.</B>This section authorizing the
    director of revenue to make regulations governing the
    registration of motor vehicles, including the name and address
    of the owner and "any other information required by the
    department", does not authorize adoption of a regulation
    defining "name of owner" so as to require registration in a
    name other than that regularly used by the applicant. Blevins
    v. Truitt, 134 Colo. 88, 299 P.2d 1100 (1956).</P>
    <P>
    <B>Payment of specific ownership tax tied to filing of
    registration application.</B>While § 42-3-123 does not in so
    many words mention "specific ownership tax", it does provide
    for "registration". And this section provides that the owner,
    upon filing an application for "registration", shall pay, among
    other fees, the "annual specific ownership tax on the vehicle
    for which the license is to issue". So, payment of the specific
    ownership tax is thereby necessarily tied into the act of
    filing an application for registration. Bd. of County Comm'rs

    <B>Annotator's note.</B>Since § 42-3-106 is similar to §
    42-3-106 as it existed prior to the 2005 amendment to article 3
    of title 42, which resulted in the relocation of provisions,
    relevant cases construing that provision and its predecessors
    have been included in the annotations to this section. 
    <P>
    <B>The facial disparity in this section and § 42-3-107 between
    ownership tax rates applicable to interstate and intrastate
    vehicles ten years old and older violated the Commerce Clause
    of the United States Constitution</B>where trucking company was
    able to show that the statutes discriminated against interstate
    commerce by unfairly imposing an economic disadvantage upon
    interstate carriers that operated vehicles subject to the tax.
    Riverton Produce Co. v. State, 871 P.2d 1213 (Colo. 1994).</P>
    <P>
    <B>The court concluded that the discriminatory provisions of
    this section and § 42-3-107 were severable from the remainder
    of the statutes</B>where the discrimination in tax rates was
    not "inextricably intertwined" with the valid provisions and
    where severing the disparity between interstate and intrastate
    vehicles would not frustrate the legislature's efforts to raise
    revenue for the maintenance of its roads and highways. Riverton
    Produce Co. v. State, 871 P.2d 1213 (Colo. 1994).</P>
    <P>
    <B>Specific ownership tax is in lieu of ad valorem
    taxes.</B>The so-called specific ownership tax on motor
    vehicles and trailers authorized by this section is a tax
    directly fixed according to a prescribed method with reference
    to each particular vehicle by the statute itself, and is in
    lieu of any and all ad valorem taxes. N. Colo. Water
    Conservancy Dist. v. Witwer, 108 Colo. 307, 116 P.2d 200
    (1941).</P>
    <P>
    <B>After having "elected" to make application for the
    registration of its special mobile equipment</B>and having in
    fact paid a special ownership tax thereon, the owner of such
    property is not thereafter subject to assessment by the county
    assessor by virtue of § 6 of art. X, Colo. Const., which
    provides, in part, that the graduated annual specific ownership
    tax shall be in lieu of all ad valorem taxes upon such
    property. Bd. of County Comm'rs v. E.J. Rippy &amp; Sons, 161

    <B>The facial disparity in this section and § 42-3-106 between

    able to show that the statutes discriminated against interstate
    commerce by unfairly imposing an economic disadvantage upon
    interstate carriers that operated vehicles subject to the tax.

  due to increased use of such motor vehicles, fees should also be
  imposed on hydrogen fuel cell motor vehicles that are powered by
  electricity produced from a fuel cell that uses hydrogen gas as
  fuel to ensure that the goal of equalizing the average aggregate
  amount of registration fees and motor fuel charges annually paid

  average fuel efficiency and current fuel efficiency for the most
  fuel-efficient motor vehicles for the Colorado light-duty and

  available, the United States light-duty and commercial motor
  vehicle fleets, and the most recent available reliable
  projections of future average fuel efficiency and future fuel
  efficiency for the most fuel-efficient motor vehicles for the
  Colorado light-duty and commercial motor vehicle fleets or, if
  Colorado data is not available, for the United States light-duty

  recognizes the many conflicts which presently exist between the
  state's traffic laws and many of the municipal traffic codes,
  which conflicts lead to uncertainty in the movement of traffic on
  the state's highways and streets. These conflicts are compounded
  by the fact that today's Americans are extremely mobile and that
  while this state enjoys a large influx of traffic from many
  areas, there is some lack of uniformity existing between the
  "rules of the road" of this state and those of other states of
  the nation. The general assembly, therefore, declares it the
  purpose of this article to alleviate these conflicts and lack of
  uniformity by conforming, as nearly as possible, certain of the
  traffic laws of this state with the recommendations of the
  national committee of uniform traffic laws and ordinances as set
  forth in the committee's "Uniform Vehicle Code".</SECTION-TEXT>

    <B>Annotator's note.</B>Since § 42-4-108 is similar to §
    42-4-106 as it existed prior to the 1994 amending of title 42
    as enacted by SB 94-1, relevant cases construing that provision
    have been included in the annotations to this section. 
    <P>
    <B>Proper standard under subsection (2)</B>for determining
    whether an emergency vehicle operator was responding to an
    emergency call is an objective standard from the perspective of
    the reasonable emergency vehicle operator. Courts must decide
    whether the emergency vehicle operator reasonably believed that
    he or she was responding to an emergency based on information
    he or she knew or should have known. Corsentino v. Cordova, 4
    P.3d 1082 (Colo. 2000).</P>
    <P>
    <B>Proper standard under subsection (2)(c)</B>for determining
    whether an emergency vehicle driver endangered life or property
    while speeding is to ask whether the emergency vehicle
    operator's speed created an unreasonable risk of injury or
    damage to life or property. Courts should limit their inquiry
    to the relationship between the conduct of the emergency
    operator prior to the accident and the circumstances
    surrounding the conduct and important factors include, but are
    not limited to, the legal speed limit in the area, the speed at
    which the operator was driving, the conditions of the road, and
    the type of area in which the operator was driving. Corsentino
    v. Cordova, 4 P.3d 1082 (Colo. 2000).</P>
    <P>
    <B>Firefighters and city immune from liability</B>when an
    eight-foot section of hard suction hose came loose from the
    truck and plaintiff drove over the hose, causing personal
    injury and damage to the car, because the fire truck was
    responding to a fire alarm and was using its emergency lights
    and sirens. City of Grand Junction v. Sisneros, 957 P.2d 1026
    (Colo. 1998).</P>
    <P>
    <B>Police officer not immune from liability</B>if operating an
    emergency vehicle with "reckless disregard for the safety of
    others". Zapp v. Kukuris, 847 P.2d 150 (Colo. App. 1992).</P>
    <P>
    <B>Running a red light without slowing down is not within the
    provisions of subsection (2)(b).</B>Therefore, the government
    may be held liable for an accident resulting from such conduct.
    Tunget v. Bd. of County Comm'rs, 992 P.2d 650 (Colo. App.
    1999).</P>
    <P>
    <B>Under the emergency vehicle exception provided for by
    subsection (2)(c) of this section and § 24-10-106 (1)(a),</B>a
    trial court must find that a police officer who exceeded the
    speed limit in pursuit of a fleeing crime suspect did not
    endanger life or property before granting immunity from a
    lawsuit resulting from a pursuit-related traffic accident. Case
    remanded where the trial court dismissed the lawsuit for lack
    of subject matter jurisdiction based on sovereign immunity
    without making such a finding. Quintana v. City of Westminster,
    8 P.3d 527 (Colo. App. 2000).</P>
    <P>
    <B>The general assembly chose not to apply the conditions of
    subsection (2) of this section to the indemnification
    provisions of § 24-10-110 (1)(b)(II)</B>because this section
    refers only to section 24-10-106 (1)(a). A public entity does
    not have immunity if an operator of an emergency vehicle speeds
    and endangers life or property in violation of subsection
    (2)(c) of this section, but the public entity is liable for any
    claims against the operator of the emergency vehicle. Only when
    the operator's acts causing the injuries are willful and wanton
    is the operator personally liable. Corsentino v. Cordova, 4
    P.3d 1082 (Colo. 2000).</P>
    <P>
    <B>Public entity and its employees immune from tort liability
    if employee operating police vehicle while in actual pursuit of
    a suspected violator of title 42,</B>even if the employee is
    not using the vehicle's emergency lights or sirens, if the
    pursuit is made to obtain verification of or evidence of the
    guilt of the suspected violator. Tidwell v. City &amp; County
    of Denver, 62 P.3d 1020 (Colo. App. 2002), rev'd on other
    grounds, 83 P.3d 75 (Colo. 2003).</P>
    <P>
    <B>Police officer was engaged in a pursuit within the
    provisions of subsection (3)</B>when the driver of a car fled
    the scene in a clear attempt to avoid arrest or further
    investigation and the officer followed the car. Tidwell v. City
    &amp; County of Denver, 83 P.3d 75 (Colo. 2003).</P>
    <P>
    <B>Police officer's pursuit was not investigatory in
    nature</B>when the officer already had authority to stop and
    arrest the driver of a car and the officer was pursuing the
    driver of the car for that reason. Therefore the officer was
    required to activate his emergency signals in order for the
    city to claim the protection of governmental immunity under the
    Governmental Immunity Act. Tidwell v. City &amp; County of
    Denver, 83 P.3d 75 (Colo. 2003).</P>
    <P>
    <B>Police officer's alleged conduct could be viewed as reckless
    and conscience-shocking for purposes of 42 U.S.C. §
    1983.</B>Police officer's alleged conduct, particularly his
    decision to speed against a red light through an intersection
    on a major boulevard without slowing down or activating his
    siren in non-emergency circumstances, all in violation of state
    law and police regulations, could be viewed as reckless and
    conscience-shocking. Williams v. City &amp; County of Denver,
    99 F.3d 1009 (10th Cir. 1996).</P>
    <P>
    <B>Dismissal of claim based on simple negligence in operation
    of an emergency vehicle was proper,</B>since standard of care
    created in subsection (4) is "reckless disregard". Zapp v.
    Kukuris, 847 P.2d 150 (Colo. App. 1992).</P>
    <P>
    <B>Applied</B>in Brown v. Kreuser, 38 Colo. App. 554, 560 P.2d

  identification system to detect speeding violations under part 11
  of this article within a highway maintenance, repair, or
  construction zone designated pursuant to section 42-4-614 (1)(a),
  if the department of public safety complies with subsections (2)
  to (6) of this section. An automated vehicle identification
  system shall not be used under this subsection (1.7) unless
  maintenance, repair, or construction is occurring at the time the
  system is being used. The department of public safety may
  contract with a vendor to implement this subsection (1.7). If the
  department of public safety contracts with a vendor, the contract
  shall incorporate the processing elements specified by the
  department of public safety. The department of public safety may
  contract with the vendor to notify violators, collect and remit
  the penalties and surcharges to the state treasury less the
  vendor's expenses, reconcile payments against outstanding
  violations, implement collection efforts, and notify the
  department of public safety of unpaid violations for possible
  referral to the judicial system. No penalty assessment or summons
  and complaint or a penalty or surcharge for a violation detected
  by an automated vehicle identification system under this
  subsection (1.7) shall be forwarded to the department for
  processing.</M></P>

    <B>State may delegate powers local in nature to local

    prohibition, there is nothing illegal about a general assembly
    delegating powers local in nature to local governmental units,
    provided that the proper constitutional tests are met as to
    maintaining a separation of powers and nonabrogation of proper
    responsibility. Asphalt Paving Co. v. Bd. of County Comm'rs,
    162 Colo. 254, 425 P.2d 289 (1967).</P>
    <P>
    <B>Municipal ordinance of local concern supersedes conflicting
    state statute.</B>Under the home-rule amendment, once a matter
    is determined to be a matter of local and municipal concern,
    any local ordinance in a home-rule city addressing the matter
    will supersede a conflicting state statute. People v. Hizhniak,
    195 Colo. 427, 579 P.2d 1131 (1978).</P>
    <P>
    <B>Authority for home-rule city to regulate traffic speeds and
    penalize offenders</B>is not found in the laws of the general
    assembly, but rather, is a matter of state constitutional law,

    <P>
    <B>This section specifically allows municipalities to regulate
    bicycles on local streets, but this authority is subject to the
    mandate in § 42-4-109</B>that any bicycle prohibition on city
    streets must be accompanied by suitable alternate bikeways.
    Webb v. City of Black Hawk, 2013 CO 9, 295 P.3d 480.</P>
    <P>
    <B>Regulation of bicycling on city streets is a matter of mixed
    state and local concern.</B>The state's interests include
    consistent application of statewide laws to avoid patchwork
    bicycle regulations that may frustrate residents statewide as
    well as potentially affecting tourism, and the interests in
    improving the state's bicycle transportation infrastructure. On
    the other hand, municipalities have a valid interest in
    controlling traffic on their local streets. Webb v. City of
    Black Hawk, 2013 CO 9, 295 P.3d 480.</P>
    <P>
    <B>This section permits all local authorities to regulate the
    speed of vehicles</B>even though the state has its own statutes
    thereon except those highways designated as connecting links in
    the state highway system. Wiggins v. McAuliffe, 144 Colo. 363,
    356 P.2d 487 (1960).</P>
    <P>
    <B>This section does not give municipality the right to
    punish.</B>This section recognizes the power of municipalities
    to regulate in particular areas of traffic and acknowledges the
    right of a municipality to regulate on subjects such as parking
    of vehicles, flow of traffic through control signs, creation of
    one-way streets, regulating speed and traffic at intersections,
    but it does not specifically approve the right of a
    municipality to punish the operator of a vehicle who drives
    without a license. Consequently, we must conclude that this
    authority has been preempted by the state and has been withheld
    from a municipality. Davis v. City &amp; County of Denver, 140
    Colo. 30, 342 P.2d 674 (1959).</P>
    <P>
    <B>Validity of legislation giving unrestricted discretion to
    local police.</B>As a qualification of the general rule, where
    the discretion to be exercised relates to police regulations
    for the protection of public morals, health, safety, or general
    welfare, and it is impracticable to fix standards without
    destroying the flexibility necessary to enable the
    administrative officials to carry out the legislative will,
    legislation delegating such discretion without such
    restrictions may be valid. Asphalt Paving Co. v. Bd. of County
    Comm'rs, 162 Colo. 254, 425 P.2d 289 (1967).</P>

    <B>The general assembly has specifically excluded implements of
    husbandry</B>from the scope of powers of local authorities to

  <M>Every motor vehicle, when operated upon a highway, shall be
  equipped with a horn in good working order and capable of
  emitting sound audible under normal conditions from a distance of
  not less than two hundred feet, but no horn or other warning
  device shall emit an unreasonably loud or harsh sound, except as
  provided in section 42-4-213 (1) in the case of authorized
  emergency vehicles or as provided in section 42-4-222. The driver
  of a motor vehicle, when reasonably necessary to ensure safe
  operation, shall give audible warning with the horn but shall not
  otherwise use such horn when upon a highway.</M>
  <P N="(2)">(2)
  <M>No vehicle shall be equipped with nor shall any person use
  upon a vehicle any audible device except as otherwise permitted
  in this section. It is permissible but not required that any
  vehicle be equipped with a theft alarm signal device which is so
  arranged that it cannot be used by the driver as a warning signal
  unless the alarm device is a required part of the vehicle.
  Nothing in this section is meant to preclude the use of audible
  warning devices that are activated when the vehicle is backing.
  Any authorized emergency vehicle may be equipped with an audible
  signal device under section 42-4-213 (1), but such device shall
  not be used except when such vehicle is operated in response to
  an emergency call or in the actual pursuit of a suspected
  violator of the law or for other special purposes, including, but
  not limited to, funerals, parades, and the escorting of
  dignitaries. Such device shall not be used for such special
  purposes unless the circumstances would not lead a reasonable
  person to believe that such vehicle is responding to an actual
  emergency.</M></P>

  <N></N>(a)
  <M>When any snowplow or other snow-removal equipment displaying
  flashing yellow lights is engaged in snow and ice removal or

  ordinary care and caution in approaching, overtaking, or passing
  such snowplow.</M></P>
  <P N="(5)(b)">(b)
  <M>The driver of a snowplow, while engaged in the removal or
  control of snow and ice on any highway open to traffic and while
  displaying the required flashing yellow warning lights as
  provided by section 42-4-214, shall not be charged with any
  violation of the provisions of this article relating to parking
  or standing, turning, backing, or yielding the right-of-way.
  These exemptions shall not relieve the driver of a snowplow from
  the duty to drive with due regard for the safety of all persons,
  nor shall these exemptions protect the driver of a snowplow from
  the consequences of a reckless or careless disregard for the
  safety of others.</M></P>

  <M>Any person who violates any provision of this section commits

  local government, displaying lights as authorized in section
  42-4-214, and performing its service function in echelon
  formation with one or more other such snowplows.</M></P>

    <B>Annotator's note.</B>Since § 42-4-237 is similar to §
    42-4-236 as it existed prior to the 1994 amending of title 42
    as enacted by SB 94-1, relevant cases construing that provision
    have been included in the annotations to this section.</P>
    <P>
    <B>The plain language of this section indicates that "safety
    belt system" refers to all of the safety belts that have been
    installed in a motor vehicle</B>to restrain drivers and front
    seat passengers. The language of this section reflects that a
    motor vehicle may contain any number, type, or combination of
    belts within its "safety belt system". The term "safety belt
    system" does not mean the belts at a particular seat. Rather, a
    "safety belt system" is comprised of the many belts contained
    within a motor vehicle to restrain drivers and front seat
    passengers. Carlson v. Ferris, 85 P.3d 504 (Colo. 2003).</P>
    <P>
    <B>Because the language of subsection (2) does not include the
    term "system", the general assembly intended "safety belt" to
    refer to the belts that have been installed in a particular
    seat</B>pursuant to federal motor vehicle safety standards.
    Carlson v. Ferris, 85 P.3d 504 (Colo. 2003).</P>
    <P>
    <B>Drivers and front seat passengers of automobiles that have
    been equipped with a lap and a shoulder belt</B>pursuant to
    federal motor vehicle safety standards must wear both the lap
    and the shoulder belt to comply with subsection (2). Carlson v.
    Ferris, 85 P.3d 504 (Colo. 2003).</P>
    <P>
    <B>Driver is required to fasten all safety belts included in a
    motor vehicle's safety belt system</B>to comply with subsection
    (2) in order to defeat a claim for failure to mitigate under
    subsection (7). Carlson v. Ferris, 58 P.3d 1055 (Colo. App.
    2002), aff'd, 85 P.3d 504 (Colo. 2003).</P>
    <P>
    <B>A jury instruction regarding the affirmative defense of
    failure to wear a seatbelt</B>should be given when it can be
    inferred with reasonable probability that pain and suffering
    will occur because of the plaintiff's failure to wear a
    seatbelt. Anderson v. Watson, 929 P.2d 6 (Colo. App. 1996)
    (supreme court in Anderson v. Watson, 953 P.2d 1284 (Colo.

    <B>The court of appeals' "inference standard" imposes an
    additional requirement on the defendant that is not
    required</B>under this section. Anderson v. Watson, 953 P.2d
    1284 (Colo. 1998) (disagreeing with the reasoning of the court
    of appeals in Anderson v. Watson annotated above).</P>

    <B>Statements regarding how the failure to use a seat belt
    caused certain injuries may be admitted.</B>Wark v. McClellan,
    68 P.3d 574 (Colo. App. 2003).</P>
    <P>
    <B>Evidence sufficient to allow seat belt defense under
    subsection (7)</B>where husband testified that he was wearing a
    seat belt and investigating officer testified that the husband
    had reported that he was not wearing a seat belt at time of
    accident. Askew v. Gerace, 851 P.2d 199 (Colo. App. 1992)
    (supreme court in Anderson v. Watson, 953 P.2d 1284 (Colo.
    1998), annotated below, disagreed with the reasoning of the
    court of appeals).</P>
    <P>
    <B>Lack of seat belt use is admissible evidence at trial</B>but
    only to reduce an award of damages for pain and suffering. Wark
    v. McClellan, 68 P.3d 574 (Colo. App. 2003).</P>
    <P>
    <B>No medical testimony required to show plaintiff's failure to
    wear a seat belt contributed to plaintiff's pain and
    suffering.</B>Askew v. Gerace, 851 P.2d 199 (Colo. App. 1992);
    Anderson v. Watson, 929 P.2d 6 (Colo. App. 1996) (supreme court
    in Anderson v. Watson, 953 P.2d 1284 (Colo. 1998), annotated
    below, disagreed with the reasoning of the court of
    appeals).</P>
    <P>
    <B>Defendant must prove a prima facie case of seat belt nonuse
    before</B>the appropriate instruction on that defense can go to
    the jury if the defendant chooses to raise that defense.
    Anderson v. Watson, 953 P.2d 1284 (Colo. 1998) (disagreeing
    with the reasoning of the court of appeals in Anderson v.
    Watson and Askew v. Gerace annotated above).</P>
    <P>
    <B>Failure to wear a seat belt automatically satisfies any
    obligation on the defendant's part</B>to show a causal
    relationship to pain and suffering. Anderson v. Watson, 953
    P.2d 1284 (Colo. 1998) (disagreeing with the reasoning of the

  <M>Legislative declarations - enactment of enhanced emissions
  program not waiver of state right to challenge authority to
  require specific loaded mode transient dynamometer technology in
  automobile emissions testing.</M></CATCH-LINE>(1)
  <M>The general assembly hereby finds and declares that sections
  42-4-301 to 42-4-316 are enacted pursuant to, and that the
  program created by said sections is designed to meet, the
  requirements of the federal "Clean Air Act", as amended by the
  federal "Clean Air Act Amendments of 1990", 42 U.S.C. sec. 7401
  et seq., as the same is in effect on November 15, 1990.</M>
  <P N="(2)(a)">(2)
  <N></N>(a)
  <M>The general assembly further finds and declares that:</M></P>
  <P N="(2)(a)(I)">(I)
  <M>The provisions of sections 42-4-301 to 42-4-316 related to the
  enhanced emissions program are enacted to comply with
  administrative requirements of rules and regulations of the
  federal environmental protection agency;</M></P>
  <P N="(2)(a)(II)">(II)
  <M>Insofar as such rules and regulations require the use of
  loaded mode transient dynamometer technology utilizing a system
  commonly known as the IM 240 in motor vehicle emissions testing,
  the general assembly finds that reliable scientific data
  questions the effectiveness of such technology to measure motor
  vehicle emissions at the high altitude of the Denver metropolitan
  area;</M></P>
  <P N="(2)(a)(III)">(III)
  <M>Less costly automobile emission testing systems may be
  available which are as effective or more effective at a lower
  cost to consumers than the loaded mode transient dynamometer test
  required by the federal environmental protection agency.</M></P>
  <P N="(2)(b)(I)">(b)
  <N></N>(I)
  <M>The general assembly, therefore, declares that the enactment
  of sections 42-4-301 to 42-4-316 in no way forecloses or limits
  the rights of the general assembly or any other appropriate
  entity of the state of Colorado to retain legal counsel as
  provided by law to request the federal environmental protection
  agency to consider alternative automobile emission inspection
  technology which may relieve Colorado of the requirements of the
  federal rules and regulations or change such rules and
  regulations to require a different technology in automobile
  emissions testing at a substantial savings in cost to consumers
  and jobs for Coloradans employed in the testing of motor vehicles
  for emissions compliance.</M></P>
  <P N="(2)(b)(II)">(II)
  <M>If the federal agency refuses to alter its policies related to
  this issue, the general assembly hereby declares that it or any
  other appropriate entity of the state of Colorado does not waive
  the right to bring appropriate legal action in a court of
  competent jurisdiction to determine the validity of the federal
  environmental protection agency's authority to require the use of
  the loaded mode transient dynamometer test for automobile
  emissions inspection commonly known as the IM 240 when such
  requirement may be in excess of the federal agency's authority
  under the federal "Clean Air Act Amendments of
  1990".</M></P></SECTION-TEXT>

  <N></N>(a)
  <M>Notwithstanding any other provision of this article to the
  contrary, the department of transportation, in the exercise of
  its discretion, may issue permits for the use of longer vehicle
  combinations. An annual permit for such use may be issued to each
  qualified carrier company. The carrier company shall maintain a
  copy of such annual permit in each vehicle operating as a longer
  vehicle combination; except that, if a peace officer, as
  described in section 16-2.5-101, C.R.S., or an authorized agent
  of the department of transportation may determine that the permit
  can be electronically verified at the time of contact, a copy of
  the permit need not be in each vehicle. The fee for the permit
  shall be two hundred fifty dollars per year.</M>
  <P N="(1)(b)">(b)
  <M>Notwithstanding the amount specified for the fee in paragraph
  (a) of this subsection (1), the executive director of the
  department by rule or as otherwise provided by law may reduce the
  amount of the fee if necessary pursuant to section 24-75-402 (3),
  C.R.S., to reduce the uncommitted reserves of the fund to which
  all or any portion of the fee is credited. After the uncommitted
  reserves of the fund are sufficiently reduced, the executive
  director of the department by rule or as otherwise provided by
  law may increase the amount of the fee as provided in section
  24-75-402 (4), C.R.S.</M></P>
  <P N="(1)(c)">(c)
  <M>The department shall provide the option to a company filing
  for a permit under this section to file an express consent waiver
  that enables the company to designate a company representative to
  be a party of interest for a violation of this section. The
  appearance of the company representative in a court hearing
  without the operator when the operator has signed such waiver
  shall not be deemed the practice of law in violation of article
  93 of title 13.</M></P>
  <P N="(2)">(2)

  <P N="(2)(b)">(b)
  <M>An unladen truck tractor, a semitrailer, and a single trailer.
  A semitrailer used with a converter dolly shall be considered a
  trailer. Semitrailers and trailers shall be of approximately
  equal lengths not to exceed forty-eight feet in length.
  Notwithstanding any other restriction set forth in this section,
  such combination may have up to eleven axles when used to
  transport empty trailers.</M></P>
  <P N="(2)(c)">(c)
  <M>An unladen truck tractor, a semitrailer, and a single trailer,
  one trailer of which is not more than forty-eight feet long, the
  other trailer of which is not more than twenty-eight feet six
  inches long. A semitrailer used with a converter dolly shall be
  considered a trailer. The shorter trailer shall be operated as
  the rear trailer.</M></P>
  <P N="(2)(d)">(d)
  <M>A truck and single trailer, having an overall length of not
  more than eighty-five feet, the truck of which is not more than
  thirty-five feet long and the trailer of which is not more than
  forty feet long. For the purposes of this paragraph (d), a
  semitrailer used with a converter dolly shall be considered a
  trailer.</M></P>
  <P N="(3)(a)">(3)
  <N></N>(a)
  <M>The long combinations are limited to interstate highway 25,
  interstate highway 76, interstate highway 70 west of its
  intersection with state highway 13 in Garfield county, interstate
  highway 70 east of its intersection with U.S. 40 and state
  highway 26, the circumferential highways designated I-225 and
  I-270, and state highway 133 in Delta county from mile marker 8.9
  to mile marker 9.7. The department of transportation shall
  promulgate rules to provide carriers with reasonable ingress to
  and egress from such designated highway segments.</M></P>
  <P N="(3)(b)">(b)
  <M>Upon action by the congress of the United States to lift the
  freeze imposed by the federal "Intermodal Surface Transportation
  Efficiency Act of 1991", Pub.L. 102-240, as amended, concerning
  the use of longer vehicle combinations, either by the total
  freeze being lifted by congress or by the approval of pilot
  projects to expand the use of longer vehicle combinations by the
  states, the department of transportation shall undertake a
  process to evaluate both interstate and state highways for
  possible authorization by the department of additional highway
  segments for inclusion by the general assembly in paragraph (a)
  of this subsection (3). During the review process, the department
  shall solicit input from all relevant stakeholders and shall work
  within existing statutory and regulatory guidelines. The
  department shall commence the review process within ninety days
  after action by congress that would allow expansion of the longer
  vehicle combination route network in Colorado.</M></P>

  <P N="(1)(b)">(b)
  <M>Subject to the limitations prescribed in section 42-4-507, the
  maximum gross weight of any vehicle or combination of vehicles
  shall not exceed that determined by the formula W = 1,000 (L +
  40), where W represents the gross weight in pounds and L
  represents the length in feet between the centers of the first
  and last axles of such vehicle or combination of vehicles; except
  that, in computation of this formula, the gross vehicle weight
  must not exceed eighty-five thousand pounds. For the purposes of
  this section, where a combination of vehicles is used, a vehicle
  must not carry a gross weight of less than ten percent of the
  overall gross weight of the combination of vehicles; except that
  these limitations shall not apply to specialized trailers of
  fixed public utilities whose axles may carry less than ten
  percent of the weight of the combination. The limitations
  provided in this section must be strictly construed and
  enforced.</M></P>
  <P N="(1)(c)">(c)
  <M>Notwithstanding any other provisions of this section, except
  as may be authorized under section 42-4-510, a person shall not
  move or operate a vehicle or combination of vehicles on any
  highway or bridge that is part of the national system of
  interstate and defense highways, also known as the interstate
  system, when the gross weight of such vehicle or combination of
  vehicles exceeds the amount determined by the formula W = 500
  [(LN/N-1) + 12N + 36], up to a maximum of eighty thousand pounds,

  investigation or tests as necessary to enable it to determine
  whether such vehicle may safely be operated upon the highways in
  compliance with all the provisions of this article. The
  department shall not register any such vehicle for a permissible
  gross weight exceeding the limitations set forth in sections
  42-4-501 to 42-4-512 and 42-4-1407. Every such vehicle shall meet

  of section 42-4-504 or paragraph (b) or (c) of subsection (1) of
  this section, the transportation commission, upon determining
  that Colorado highways have been constructed to standards which
  will accommodate such additional size or weight and that the
  adoption of said size and weight limitations will not jeopardize
  any distribution of federal highway funds to the state, may adopt
  size and weight limits comparable to those prescribed or adopted
  by the federal highway administration or the United States
  congress and may authorize said limits to be used by owners or
  operators of vehicles while said vehicles are using highways
  within this state; but no vehicle size or weight limit so adopted
  by the commission shall be less in any respect than those now
  provided for in section 42-4-504 or paragraph (b) or (c) of

  <P N="(2)(b)">(b)
  <M>A cooperative agreement under this section may include, but

    <B>State law does not take away city's power to regulate
    traffic.</B>If a city has power under the state constitution to
    pass ordinances regulating vehicular traffic upon its streets,
    it cannot be deprived of that power by the passage of a state
    law. And if there is a conflict between statute and ordinance
    the ordinance controls. City &amp; County of Denver v. Henry,

    <P>
    <B>Question of contributory negligence measured by requirements
    of city ordinance.</B>Thus, in action for injuries sustained in
    automobile accident at an intersection, the question of
    plaintiff's contributory negligence must be measured by the
    requirements of the city ordinance relating to right-of-way at
    intersections and not by this section, where there was a

    <P>
    <B>Insufficient evidence to charge contributory
    negligence.</B>To properly apply the "look but not see" rule,
    as a matter of law, it is elemental that the approaching
    vehicle must be plainly visible and that the view of it must be
    unobstructed. If the evidence on these points is not clear or
    is disputed, then it remains a fact question for the trier of
    the facts to resolve. The effect of these findings by the trial
    court is that the evidence was insufficient to charge the
    defendant with contributory negligence when plaintiff
    negligently failed to yield right-of-way. Hernandez v. Ratliff,
    172 Colo. 129, 470 P.2d 579 (1970).</P>
    <P>
    <B>Need not yield right-of-way to one already at fault.</B>A
    driver cannot be required to yield the right-of-way when his
    inability to know and act is chargeable to the lawless conduct
    of him who claims it. Boyd v. Close, 82 Colo. 150, 257 P. 1079

    <P>
    <B>Violation is question for jury.</B>Whether or not either of
    the drivers or both were negligent in violating this section
    and whether said negligence was the proximate cause of this
    accident, or whether it was caused by the joint and concurrent
    negligence of both, are questions of fact for the jury to

    <B>Annotator's note.</B>Since § 42-4-1002 is similar to §
    42-4-902 as it existed prior to the 1994 amending of title 42
    as enacted by SB 94-1, relevant cases construing that provision

    <P>
    <B>This section contemplates two lines of traffic,</B>and a
    main traveled roadway sufficient in width for their
    accommodation. The statute by its terms clearly requires the
    yielding, as nearly as possible, by each of two vehicles
    approaching each other, of at least one-half of the main
    traveled portion of the roadway. So far as the statute is
    explicit, the main traveled portion may be in the center, or on
    either side of the roadway. One-half of such traveled portion
    is exacted of each traveler, if it is possible to be given; if
    not, then as nearly as possible. Parrish v. Smith, 102 Colo.
    250, 78 P.2d 629 (1938); Parrish v. Smith, 108 Colo. 256, 115
    P.2d 647 (1941).</P>
    <P>
    <B>A situation might arise in which a strict compliance with
    these statutory requirements would be impossible.</B>The
    reasonable provisions are indicated for roadways, and of course
    no fixed application thereof could be made to parts of a road
    under construction, where changing conditions would not permit
    orderly travel under established rules. Parrish v. Smith, 102
    Colo. 250, 78 P.2d 629 (1938); Parrish v. Smith, 108 Colo. 256,
    115 P.2d 647 (1941); Orth v. Bauer, 163 Colo. 136, 429 P.2d 279
    (1967).</P>
    <P>
    <B>In a case in which strict compliance with these statutory
    requirements would be impossible,</B>then the ordinary rules
    are suspended. An ordinarily prudent traveler with any warning
    at all, in approaching a place of construction is bound to know
    that all rules of the road are suspended, and upon entering
    such an area be prepared -- for his own safety and that of
    others -- to submit to, and be governed by, conditions as he
    finds them. In such circumstances he cannot rely upon written
    traffic rules. Parrish v. Smith, 102 Colo. 250, 78 P.2d 629
    (1938); Parrish v. Smith, 108 Colo. 256, 115 P.2d 647
    (1941).</P>
    <P>
    <B>Suspension of rules is question for jury.</B>The question as
    to whether the physical condition of the roadway and its width
    were sufficient to permit a truck to yield one-half of the
    roadway to an automobile, as required by this section, is
    properly submitted to the jury. Parrish v. Smith, 108 Colo.
    256, 115 P.2d 647 (1941).</P>
    <P>
    <B>Violation of section not negligence per se.</B>Violation of
    this section requiring drivers to yield at least half of the
    roadway is not negligence per se. Sanchez v. Staats, 34 Colo.
    App. 243, 526 P.2d 672 (1974), aff'd, 189 Colo. 228, 539 P.2d
    1233 (1975).</P>
    <P>
    <B>The rule that driving on the wrong side of the road is
    presumptive evidence of negligence, must be applied on a case
    by case basis</B>and cannot apply to every fact situation. Orth

  the purpose of entering into a contract for the operation of the
  high occupancy toll lane by a private entity; except that the

  where the high occupancy toll lane is located including for
  maintenance and enforcement purposes in the high occupancy toll
  lane and for other traffic congestion relieving options including
  transit. Such contract shall define or provide a method for
  calculating excess toll revenues and shall specify the amount of
  indebtedness that the private entity may incur and apply excess
  toll revenues to before such revenues must be paid into the state

    <B>Annotator's note.</B>Since § 42-4-1101 is similar to §
    42-4-1001 as it existed prior to the 1994 amending of title 42
    as enacted by SB 94-1, relevant cases construing that provision
    have been included with the annotations to this section. 
    <P>
    <B>Speeding classifications constitutional.</B>Decision to
    treat higher rates of speeding as more serious making them
    criminal acts is within legislature's discretion and does not
    create a suspect class or infringe on a fundamental right.
    Drawing a distinction based on speed is rationally related to
    legislative purpose of safety and fuel conservation. People v.
    Lewis, 745 P.2d 668 (Colo. 1987).</P>
    <P>
    <B>It was the legislative intent of the general assembly in
    enacting the provisions of this section effective January 24,
    1974,</B>to fix a speed limit of 55 miles per hour for the
    period during which federal restrictions, as originated in the
    emergency highway energy conservation act, continued under the
    federal aid highway amendments of 1974, until such time as the
    general assembly took further action. People v. Driver, 189
    Colo. 276, 539 P.2d 1248 (1975).</P>
    <P>The general assembly clearly intended to enact an
    enforceable 55 mile-per-hour maximum speed limit, because
    maintenance of federal highway funding was contingent upon
    enactment of such a statute. Olinyk v. People, 642 P.2d 490
    (Colo. 1982).</P>
    <P>
    <B>The policy considerations behind the enactment of this
    section</B>prohibiting the driving of a vehicle in excess of
    the maximum speed of 55 miles per hour is that a driver must be
    charged as a matter of public policy, with the responsibility
    of ensuring that his vehicle is safe, so as to minimize the
    risk inherent in travel on our public highways. People v.
    Caddy, 189 Colo. 353, 540 P.2d 1089 (1975).</P>
    <P>
    <B>Intent to enact enforceable speed limit.</B>It was obviously
    the intention of the general assembly to enact a maximum speed
    limit enforceable through penal sanctions. Olinyk v. People,
    642 P.2d 490 (Colo. 1982).</P>
    <P>
    <B>Speed limit is enforceable.</B>Since the penalty applicable
    to violation of the 55 mile-per-hour speed limit charged by
    complaint and summons is ascertainable, the speed limit is
    enforceable. Olinyk v. People, 642 P.2d 490 (Colo. 1982).</P>
    <P>
    <B>Speed should be no greater than is reasonable and
    prudent.</B>The driver of a motor vehicle must at all times so
    operate it as to maintain reasonable control over it, at a
    speed no greater than is reasonable and prudent under the
    conditions then existing. Bennett v. Hall, 132 Colo. 419, 290
    P.2d 241 (1955); Union P. R. R. v. Snyder, 220 F.2d 388 (10th
    Cir. 1955); Eagan v. Maiselson, 142 Colo. 233, 350 P.2d 567
    (1960); Mayer v. Sampson, 157 Colo. 278, 402 P.2d 185
    (1965).</P>
    <P>
    <B>This section creates a mandatory rebuttable
    presumption</B>that if the prosecution proves that a defendant
    was driving in excess of the posted speed limit, the burden of
    going forward shifts to the defendant to prove that his or her
    speed was reasonable and prudent under the circumstances.
    People v. Hoskin, 2016 CO 63, 380 P.3d 130.</P>
    <P>
    <B>And mandatory rebuttable presumption does not violate due
    process.</B>People v. Hoskin, 2016 CO 63, 380 P.3d 130.</P>
    <P>
    <B>A "special hazard" can be anything that is not a normal
    traffic condition.</B>It need not be an unusual event such as
    heavy traffic after a parade or sports event. A construction
    zone may well be a "special hazard". Dempsey v. Denver Police
    Dept., 2015 COA 67, 353 P.3d 928.</P>
    <P>
    <B>The appropriate signs erected pursuant to subsection (2) of
    this section indicate the speed limit starts at the physical
    location of the sign and continues to be in effect until the
    next different speed limit sign</B>pursuant to the manual
    adopted by the department of transportation pursuant to §
    42-4-104. Shafron v. Cooke, 190 P.3d 812 (Colo. App. 2008).</P>
    <P>
    <B>Crime irrespective of intent or scienter.</B>Although the
    absence of a specified "culpable mental state" in this section
    is not conclusive on the issue, it is well settled that the
    general assembly may make a prohibited act a crime,
    irrespective of the elements of intent or scienter, when public
    policy so requires. People v. Caddy, 189 Colo. 353, 540 P.2d
    1089 (1975).</P>
    <P>
    <B>Offense of strict liability.</B>In the absence of a
    specified element of "criminal intent", and because of the
    strong public policy considerations, speeding is an offense of
    strict liability. People v. Caddy, 189 Colo. 353, 540 P.2d 1089
    (1975).</P>
    <P>
    <B>Lack of culpable mental state no defense.</B>Even though
    defendant presented evidence at trial that his speedometer
    reflected a speed 10 miles per hour below the true speed of his
    vehicle, and that he had no knowledge that the speedometer
    reading was in error, or that he should have known of the
    defective speedometer, his lack of a culpable mental state was
    not a defense to the charge of speeding. People v. Caddy, 189
    Colo. 353, 540 P.2d 1089 (1975).</P>
    <P>There is no element of mental culpability required in the
    speeding statute. People v. Caddy, 189 Colo. 353, 540 P.2d 1089
    (1975).</P>
    <P>
    <B>Lack of criminal intent is not a defense</B>to a charge of
    speeding. People v. Caddy, 189 Colo. 353, 540 P.2d 1089
    (1975).</P>
    <P>
    <B>Justification is recognized as an affirmative defense to the
    charge of speeding,</B>but the defendant must present credible
    evidence as to the specific threat of injury and the lack of a
    reasonable alternative other than commission of the offense.
    People v. Dover, 790 P.2d 834 (Colo. 1990).</P>
    <P>
    <B>A county court has jurisdiction over the subject matter of
    offenses alleged to have been committed under this
    section.</B>People v. Griffith, 130 Colo. 475, 276 P.2d 559
    (1954).</P>
    <P>
    <B>Violation is question for jury.</B>In an action for damages
    resulting from an automobile accident, the question whether
    defendant was driving in excess of the statutory speed limit,
    and if not, whether he was driving at such a rate of speed, as
    would, under the circumstances constitute negligence, is for
    the determination of the jury. Carlson v. Millisack, 82 Colo.
    491, 261 P. 657 (1927); Amos v. Remington Arms Co., 117 Colo.
    399, 188 P.2d 896 (1948); Eagan v. Maiselson, 142 Colo. 233,

    <P>
    <B>The statute is a proper delegation of legislative
    authority</B>to department of highways with adequate safeguards
    to protect against an uncontrolled exercise of discretionary
    power. It allows for imposition of more than one speed limit
    for different vehicle types on a state highway or segment
    thereof, if this is necessary for public safety. People v.
    Peterson, 734 P.2d 118 (Colo. 1987).</P>

  <P N="(7)(b)">(b)
  <M>The general assembly determines that:</M></P>
  <P N="(7)(b)(I)">(I)
  <M>Reserved parking for persons with disabilities is a
  state-administered program and that identifying license plates
  and placards are issued under state law;</M></P>
  <P N="(7)(b)(II)">(II)
  <M>Because local regulations regarding reserved parking for
  persons with disabilities vary significantly across
  jurisdictions, they are inconsistent and confusing for persons
  with disabilities, medical professionals, peace officers, and
  members of the general public;</M></P>
  <P N="(7)(b)(III)">(III)
  <M>Modern life requires travel across multiple local
  jurisdictions. Inconsistent local marking and enforcement of
  reserved parking for persons with disabilities confuses people,
  which prevents them from fully obeying disabled parking
  regulations.</M></P>
  <P N="(7)(b)(IV)">(IV)
  <M>A message disseminated by one political subdivision of the
  state using modern communication methods will be received by
  individuals from multiple political subdivisions. Any attempt to
  use modern communication methods to educate the public on local
  regulations governing reserved parking for persons with
  disabilities will result in public exposure to multiple
  inconsistent, confusing regulations, so education requires
  uniform regulation across the state, and a statewide effort is
  needed to educate the public about disabled parking. This effort
  is funded by fines that are typically issued by local
  authorities.</M></P>
  <P N="(7)(c)">(c)
  <M>The general assembly therefore declares that access to
  reserved parking by persons with disabilities is a matter of
  statewide concern and that the provisions set forth in this
  section preempt any action contrary to this section if the action
  is adopted by a political subdivision of the
  state.</M></P></SECTION-TEXT>

  <M>In addition to any other liability provided for in this
  article, the owner of a motor vehicle who is engaged in the
  business of leasing or renting motor vehicles is liable for
  payment of a parking violation fine unless the owner of the
  leased or rented motor vehicle can furnish sufficient evidence
  that the vehicle was, at the time of the parking violation, in

  liability for payment the owner of the motor vehicle is required,
  within a reasonable time after notification of the parking
  violation, to furnish to the prosecutorial division of the
  appropriate jurisdiction the name and address of the person or
  company who leased, rented, or otherwise had the care, custody,
  or control of such vehicle. As a condition to avoid liability for
  payment of a parking violation, any person or company who leases
  or rents motor vehicles to another person shall attach to the
  leasing or rental agreement a notice stating that, pursuant to
  the requirements of this section, the operator of the vehicle is
  liable for payment of a parking violation fine incurred when the
  operator has the care, custody, or control of the motor vehicle.
  The notice shall inform the operator that the operator's name and

  <M>A person who drives a motor vehicle or vehicle when the
  person's BAC is 0.08 or more at the time of driving or within two
  hours after driving commits DUI per se. During a trial, if the
  state's evidence raises the issue, or if a defendant presents
  some credible evidence, that the defendant consumed alcohol
  between the time that the defendant stopped driving and the time
  that testing occurred, such issue shall be an affirmative
  defense, and the prosecution must establish beyond a reasonable
  doubt that the minimum 0.08 blood or breath alcohol content
  required in this subsection (2)(a) was reached as a result of
  alcohol consumed by the defendant before the defendant stopped
  driving. DUI per se is a misdemeanor, but it is a class 4 felony
  if the violation occurred after three or more prior convictions,
  arising out of separate and distinct criminal episodes, for DUI,
  DUI per se, or DWAI; vehicular homicide, as described in section
  18-3-106 (1)(b); vehicular assault, as described in section

  show and other facts so that the trier of fact could infer that
  the tests were in some way defective or inaccurate. Such evidence
  may include testimony of nonexpert witnesses relating to the

  the analysis of the person's blood or breath.</M></P>

  <M>Pursuant to section 16-2-106, C.R.S., in charging the offense

  the person's BAC, as shown by analysis of the person's breath, is
  at least 0.02 but not more than 0.05 at the time of driving or
  within two hours after driving. The court, upon sentencing a
  defendant pursuant to this subparagraph (I), may order, in
  addition to any penalty imposed under a class A traffic
  infraction, that the defendant perform up to twenty-four hours of
  useful public service, subject to the conditions and restrictions
  of section 18-1.3-507, C.R.S., and may further order that the

  upon a good faith representation by the prosecuting attorney that
  the attorney could not establish a prima facie case if the
  defendant were brought to trial on the original alcohol-related

  <P N="(5)">(5)
  <M>Notwithstanding the provisions of section 18-1-408, C.R.S.,
  during a trial of any person accused of both DUI and DUI per se,
  the court shall not require the prosecution to elect between the
  two violations. The court or a jury may consider and convict the
  person of either DUI or DWAI, or DUI per se, or both DUI and DUI
  per se, or both DWAI and DUI per se. If the person is convicted
  of more than one violation, the sentences imposed shall run

  <M>In any prosecution for DUI or DWAI, the defendant's BAC or

  following presumptions or inferences:</M></P>
  <P N="(6)(a)(I)">(I)
  <M>If at such time the defendant's BAC was 0.05 or less, it shall
  be presumed that the defendant was not under the influence of
  alcohol and that the defendant's ability to operate a motor
  vehicle or vehicle was not impaired by the consumption of
  alcohol.</M></P>
  <P N="(6)(a)(II)">(II)
  <M>If at such time the defendant's BAC was in excess of 0.05 but
  less than 0.08, such fact gives rise to the permissible inference
  that the defendant's ability to operate a motor vehicle or

  may also be considered with other competent evidence in
  determining whether or not the defendant was under the influence
  of alcohol.</M></P>
  <P N="(6)(a)(III)">(III)
  <M>If at such time the defendant's BAC was 0.08 or more, such
  fact gives rise to the permissible inference that the defendant
  was under the influence of alcohol.</M></P>
  <P N="(6)(a)(IV)">(IV)
  <M>If at such time the driver's blood contained five nanograms or
  more of delta 9-tetrahydrocannabinol per milliliter in whole
  blood, as shown by analysis of the defendant's blood, such fact
  gives rise to a permissible inference that the defendant was
  under the influence of one or more drugs.</M></P>
  <P N="(6)(b)">(b)
  <M>The limitations of this subsection (6) shall not be construed
  as limiting the introduction, reception, or consideration of any
  other competent evidence bearing upon the question of whether or

  <N></N>(I)
  <M>In all actions, suits, and judicial proceedings in any court
  of this state concerning alcohol-related or drug-related traffic
  offenses, the court shall take judicial notice of methods of
  testing a person's alcohol or drug level and of the design and
  operation of devices, as certified by the department of public
  health and environment, for testing a person's blood, breath,
  saliva, or urine to determine such person's alcohol or drug
  level. The department of public health and environment may, by
  rule, determine that, because of the reliability of the results
  from certain devices, the collection or preservation of a second
  sample of a person's blood, saliva, or urine or the collection
  and preservation of a delayed breath alcohol specimen is not
  required.</M></P>
  <P N="(6)(c)(II)">(II)
  <M>Nothing in this paragraph (c) prevents the necessity of
  establishing during a trial that the testing devices used were

  <M>Any party who obtains an order in a pending civil or criminal
  case if the court finds the party has shown good cause to have

  the materials sought are evidentiary and relevant; whether the
  materials are not otherwise procurable reasonably in advance of
  the proceeding by the exercise of due diligence; whether the
  party cannot properly prepare for the proceeding without such
  production and inspection in advance of the proceeding, and the
  failure to obtain such inspection may tend to unreasonably delay

  that the extent of noncompliance with a board of health rule has
  so impaired the validity and reliability of the testing method
  and the test results as to render the evidence inadmissible. In

  <M>In any trial for a violation of this section, the testimony of
  a law enforcement officer that he or she witnessed the taking of

  provide a sample of the driver's breath for such preliminary
  test; except that, if the driver is under twenty-one years of

  <P N="(6)(i)(III)">(III)
  <M>Neither the results of such preliminary screening test nor the

    <B>Annotator's note.</B>Since § 42-4-1301 is similar to §
    42-4-1301 as it existed prior to its 2002 amendment and §
    42-4-1202 as it existed prior to the 1994 amending of title 42
    as enacted by SB 94-1, relevant cases construing those
    provisions have been included in the annotations to this
    section.</P>
    <P>
    <B>Procedural due process violated when guilty plea to serious
    offense entered in summary proceeding.</B>In view of the
    serious consequences which follow the entry of a plea of guilty
    to driving under the influence of alcohol, the summary disposal
    immediately after arrest, notwithstanding the belief of the
    officer, evidenced by the fact that he filed the charge, that
    the accused was under the influence of liquor, constitutes a
    serious deprivation of the constitutional right of the accused
    to a fair trial. It is axiomatic that justice delayed is
    justice denied, but there are limits to the acceleration
    process, and the instant procedure was so unjustifiably sudden
    as to constitute a violation of the constitutional guarantee of
    procedural due process of law. Toland v. Strohl, 147 Colo. 577,
    364 P.2d 588 (1961).</P>
    <P>
    <B>A first-time charge of driving while ability impaired is not
    a petty offense.</B>The general assembly's placement of
    numerous alcohol and drug-related offenses in a single statute
    demonstrates an intention to not treat first-time driving while
    ability impaired offenses as petty offenses. The penalties are
    dependant upon circumstances that may not be known by the court
    at the time of arraignment. The penalties for a first-time
    offense may easily exceed those of a petty offense under
    §16-10-109. Therefore, defendants are not required to file with
    a court under §16-10-109 to obtain a trial by jury. Byrd v.
    Stavely, 113 P.3d 1273 (Colo. App. 2005).</P>
    <P>
    <B>Failure to preserve a second sample of the defendant's blood
    for independent testing did not violate his due process
    rights</B>under the state constitution because the test for
    materiality of evidence set forth in People v. Greathouse (742
    P.2d 334 (Colo. 1987)) was not met. People v. Humes, 762 P.2d
    665 (Colo. 1988).</P>
    <P>
    <B>Defendant, who was convicted of vehicular assault while
    under the influence, vehicular assault by driving recklessly,
    and driving under the influence, was not denied her right to
    procedural due process</B>by the prosecution's failure to
    preserve a second sample of her breath at the time the
    breathalyzer test was administered to her or to keep the
    victim's car in storage. Defendant failed to meet the test of
    materiality set forth in People v. Greathouse (742 P.2d 334
    (Colo. 1987)) or the test for bad faith set forth in Arizona v.
    Youngblood (488 U.S. 51 (1988)). People v. Acosta, 860 P.2d

    <B>Challenge raised initially on appeal to supreme court not

    will not be considered if raised for the first time on appeal
    to the supreme court. Colgan v. State Dept. of Rev., 623 P.2d
    871 (Colo. 1981).</P>
    <P>
    <B>Subsection (6)(d) is not unconstitutional because use of
    refusal to consent to blood alcohol test as evidence of guilt
    does not violate fourth amendment right prohibiting

    <B>Governmental purpose.</B>The implied consent statute serves
    the distinct governmental purpose of facilitating citizen
    cooperation in achieving traffic safety by the use of the
    administrative sanction of revocation upon a refusal to submit
    to a test, while the statutory authorization for a probationary
    license is expressly directed towards the "alcohol and drug
    traffic driving education or treatment" of the convicted
    traffic offender. DeScala v. Motor Vehicle Div., 667 P.2d 1360
    (Colo. 1983).</P>
    <P>
    <B>Legislative policy of this state</B>has been to create a
    graduated scale of penalties arising from driving an automobile
    after the use of intoxicants. Thompson v. People, 181 Colo.
    194, 510 P.2d 311 (1973).</P>
    <P>
    <B>The primary purpose of this section</B>is to obtain
    scientific evidence of the amount of alcohol in the bloodstream
    in order to curb drunk driving through prosecution for that
    offense. Zahtila v. Motor Vehicle Div., 39 Colo. App. 8, 560
    P.2d 847 (1977); Hess v. Tice, 43 Colo. App. 47, 598 P.2d 536

    the drinking driver. Marin v. Colo. Dept. of Rev., 41 Colo.
    App. 557, 591 P.2d 1336 (1978).</P>
    <P>
    <B>The terms "intoxicated", "drunk", and "under the influence
    of intoxicating liquor" are substantially synonymous.</B>There
    is no reason to allow opinion testimony by a lay witness
    phrased in one of these terms and to prohibit it when it is
    phrased in another of these terms. People v. Norman, 194 Colo.
    372, 572 P.2d 819 (1977).</P>
    <P>
    <B>The terms "drive" and "drove" as used in this section and
    for purposes of the DUI statute include "actual physical
    control" of a vehicle,</B>even if the vehicle is not actually
    moving. Proof that a person is in actual physical control of a
    vehicle is sufficient to prove that the person drove the
    vehicle. People v. Swain, 959 P.2d 426 (Colo. 1998); People v.
    Valdez, 2014 COA 125, 411 P.3d 94.</P>
    <P>
    <B>Driving a motor vehicle means exercising physical control
    over a motor vehicle.</B>Although the court did not instruct
    the jury that it must find the vehicle was reasonably capable
    of being rendered operable, it did not err because there was
    undisputed testimony that the vehicle's alleged inoperability
    was a result only of a lack of fuel and a dead battery. These
    circumstances do not, as a matter of law, render a vehicle not
    reasonably capable of being rendered operable. People v.
    VanMatre, 190 P.3d 770 (Colo. App. 2008).</P>
    <P>
    <B>Prosecution not required to prove the operability of a
    vehicle beyond a reasonable doubt.</B>People v. Valdez, 2014
    COA 125, 411 P.3d 94.</P>
    <P>
    <B>Trial court did not commit plain error</B>in upholding the
    jury's separate convictions for DUI and aggravated driving
    after revocation prohibited offenses and for imposing separate
    sentences for those crimes. People v. Valdez, 2014 COA 125, 411

    <P>
    <B>This section is not vague, indefinite, nor uncertain</B>as
    there are reasonable ascertainable standards by which the guilt
    of an accused can be determined. Thompson v. People, 181 Colo.
    194, 510 P.2d 311 (1973).</P>
    <P>This section, when read as a whole, provides standards
    sufficiently precise to inform the defendant of the crime
    charged. Thompson v. People, 181 Colo. 194, 510 P.2d 311
    (1973).</P>
    <P>
    <B>Defendant not deprived of his constitutional right to equal
    protection under this section</B>since all class 2 misdemeanors
    do not reflect similar criminal conduct to which similar
    sanctions must be applied, the general assembly is entitled to
    establish more severe penalties for acts that it believes have
    greater social impact and graver consequences, and the
    defendant failed to prove that the mandatory sentencing scheme
    has impacted him differently from all other persons convicted
    of similar criminal conduct of driving under the influence.
    People v. Martinnillie, 940 P.2d 1090 (Colo. App. 1996).</P>
    <P>
    <B>For even a full reading of the penalty section of this
    section would not apprise the accused of the consequences of
    the guilty plea.</B>If, as the charge suggests, the accused was
    under the influence of liquor, he could not give an effectual
    waiver. The fact that the accused evidenced a desire to accept
    the impetuous proceedings tendered does not in the present
    circumstances justify the summary disposition of the charge.
    Toland v. Strohl, 147 Colo. 577, 364 P.2d 588 (1961).</P>
    <P>
    <B>It is a misdemeanor for any person under the influence of
    intoxicating liquor to drive</B>an automobile on the public
    highways. Solt v. People, 130 Colo. 1, 272 P.2d 638 (1954);

    <P>
    <B>Traffic laws and revocation procedures contained in §§
    42-2-122 and 42-2-203 are aimed at all drivers who</B>operate a
    motor vehicle while under the influence of alcohol or while
    their ability is impaired, regardless of their status as
    alcoholics or problem drinkers. Heninger v. Charnes, 200 Colo.
    194, 613 P.2d 884 (1980).</P>
    <P>
    <B>Subsection (1)(b) intended to be a less serious offense than
    subsection (1)(a).</B>The penalty and presumptions of this
    section clearly show a legislative intent that subsection
    (1)(b) is a less serious offense than subsection (1)(a), and
    demonstrates that the general assembly intended to establish
    two levels of prohibited conduct. Thompson v. People, 181 Colo.
    194, 510 P.2d 311 (1973).</P>
    <P>
    <B>And is a lesser included offense.</B>Driving while one's
    ability is impaired due to consumption of alcohol is considered
    a lesser included offense of driving under the influence of
    intoxicating liquor if the evidence warrants. Thompson v.
    People, 181 Colo. 194, 510 P.2d 311 (1973).</P>
    <P>
    <B>Driving under the influence is a lesser included offense of
    aggravated driving after revocation.</B>Merger principles
    preclude conviction for a lesser included offense of a crime
    for which a defendant has also been convicted in the same
    prosecution. People v. Mersman, 148 P.3d 199 (Colo. App.
    2006).</P>
    <P>
    <B>Driving under the influence is a lesser included offense of
    vehicular assault.</B>If a person is guilty of vehicular
    assault by virtue of driving under the influence, driving under
    the influence is a lesser included offense prohibited by the
    double jeopardy clause. People v. Cruthers, 124 P.3d 887 (Colo.
    App. 2005); People v. Smoots, 2013 COA 152, 396 P.3d 53, aff'd
    sub nom. Reyna-Abarca v. People, 2017 CO 15, 390 P.3d 816.</P>
    <P>
    <B>Misdemeanor offenses under this section are not the same as
    the felony offenses under § 18-3-205</B>because the elements
    and the required proof for conviction are different. People v.
    Smith, 182 Colo. 228, 512 P.2d 269 (1973).</P>
    <P>The misdemeanor count of driving while under the influence
    of intoxicating liquor is not the same offense as the felony
    count of inflicting bodily injury by operating an automobile in
    a reckless manner while under the influence of intoxicating
    liquor. People v. Smith, 182 Colo. 228, 512 P.2d 269
    (1973).</P>
    <P>
    <B>And are not lesser included offenses.</B>Driving under the
    influence of intoxicating liquor and driving while ability is
    impaired are not lesser included offenses of the felony charge
    of inflicting bodily injury while under the influence of
    intoxicating liquor by driving an automobile in a reckless
    manner. People v. Smith, 182 Colo. 228, 512 P.2d 269
    (1973).</P>
    <P>
    <B>Dismissal of count under this section not bar to prosecution
    under § 18-3-205.</B>The court's dismissal of a misdemeanor
    count under this section, which placed the defendant in
    jeopardy as to that count, did not bar prosecution on felony
    count under § 18-3-205. People v. Smith, 182 Colo. 228, 512
    P.2d 269 (1973).</P>
    <P>
    <B>Dismissal by hearing officer not bar to subsequent
    action.</B>Absent the sworn report of the law enforcement
    officer, a hearing officer may dismiss a case without
    prejudice; and such dismissal is not on the merits and does not
    bar a subsequent action on the same incident. McBride v. State
    Dept. of Rev., 626 P.2d 760 (Colo. App. 1981).</P>

    <B>Failure of police to obtain test from unconscious victim
    pursuant to subsection (7)(c) does not entitle defendant to a
    dismissal of the charges under this section</B>when the
    defendant cannot show that the failure was in bad faith. People

    <P>
    <B>Where officer made no attempt to comply with the

    <P>
    <B>Section not applicable to person not driving on public

    section do not apply to one who is not driving upon a public
    highway. Dayhoff v. State Motor Vehicle Div., 42 Colo. App. 91,
    595 P.2d 1051 (1979), aff'd, 199 Colo. 363, 609 P.2d 119

    Gilbert v. Dolan, 41 Colo. App. 173, 586 P.2d 233 (1978).</P>
    <P>Under this section, an officer may make an arrest of one who
    commits a moving violation and then, if he has probable cause
    to believe that the person is driving under the influence of
    alcohol, can request that the driver take a chemical test, even
    though he is not under arrest at the time for driving under the
    influence. On the other hand, the officer may, in the first
    instance, arrest the suspect for driving while under the
    influence and then request a test be taken. Johnson v. Motor
    Vehicle Div., 38 Colo. App. 230, 556 P.2d 488 (1976).</P>
    <P>
    <B>Advisement form must contain reasons for believing driver
    under influence.</B>The advisement form must contain the
    officer's reasons for believing a driver was under the
    influence of alcohol and the officer may not later supplement
    those reasons by testimony at the implied consent hearing.
    Marquez v. Charnes, 632 P.2d 640 (Colo. App. 1981).</P>
    <P>
    <B>But not reason for stopping driver.</B>It is not necessary
    for the officer to set out the reason on the advisement form
    for stopping a driver. Marquez v. Charnes, 632 P.2d 640 (Colo.

    <P>
    <B>Grounds for believing driver under the influence

    <P>
    <B>Inference that person behind wheel was driver held
    appropriate.</B>The inference drawn by a police officer, that
    one seated behind the wheel of, and attempting to start, a
    vehicle stopped in a highway travel lane was a driver thereof,
    was not inappropriate, and served as an adequate basis for the
    officer to proceed pursuant to this section. Johnson v. Motor

    1989 enactment of subsection (1)(g)).</P>
    <P>
    <B>Reasonable grounds to arrest driver.</B>Evidence that a
    driver's automobile was weaving across traffic lanes and
    speeding, that there was an odor of alcohol on the driver's
    breath, and that the driver did not satisfactorily perform the
    roadside sobriety tests, is sufficient to support a hearing
    officer's finding that there existed "reasonable grounds" to
    believe that the driver was driving under the influence of
    alcohol. Hall v. Charnes, 42 Colo. App. 111, 590 P.2d 516
    (1979).</P>
    <P>
    <B>Reasonable grounds to believe licensee was driving under the
    influence of or impaired by alcohol.</B>Based on his own
    observations, the information received from the investigating
    officer and the fact that the licensee did not deny the written
    allegation in the advisement form that he had been driving a
    motor vehicle, the officer had reasonable grounds to believe
    that the licensee had been driving under the influence of or
    impaired by alcohol. Colo. Dept. of Rev. v. Kirke, 743 P.2d 16
    (Colo. 1987) (decided under law in effect prior to 1983

    <P>
    <B>Express consent provision does not apply to roadside
    sobriety tests.</B>Instead it deals only with the express
    consent given by any driver on state roads to take a blood or
    breath test if a peace officer has probable cause to arrest for
    an alcohol driving offense. United States v. Hopp, 943 F. Supp.
    1313 (D. Colo. 1996).</P>
    <P>
    <B>Failure to request suppression of test results is waiver of
    objection.</B>Where defendant not only failed to request
    suppression of the breath test results but also stipulated to
    those results and permitted them to be received in evidence
    without objection, he has waived any right to object on appeal
    to the admission of this evidence, absent a showing of plain
    error. People v. Dee, 638 P.2d 749 (Colo. 1981).</P>
    <P>
    <B>Defective complaint does not bar prosecution.</B>A complaint
    charging driving a vehicle "while under the influence of
    intoxicating liquor or drugs," in the disjunctive, is defective
    in form only, and an amendment should be allowed to cure this
    technical irregularity. People v. Dickinson, 197 Colo. 338, 592
    P.2d 807 (1979).</P>
    <P>
    <B>Evidence held admissible.</B>Video portion of movie film
    taken at the time of arrest, showing defendant's refusal to
    take some of the sobriety tests requested by the police and
    pictures of his going through one test, later was admissible in
    prosecution for driving under the influence regardless of fact
    that the sound on the film had been ordered suppressed by the
    court because it revealed that defendant invoked his
    constitutional right to remain silent. Thompson v. People, 181
    Colo. 194, 510 P.2d 311 (1973).</P>
    <P>The appellant's erratic driving behavior constituted
    sufficient probable cause to stop his car. Thus, the results of
    the roadside sobriety tests conducted by a deputy sheriff were
    validly included in the evidence adduced at the hearing under
    this section. Stream v. Heckers, 184 Colo. 149, 519 P.2d 336
    (1974).</P>
    <P>Claim that roadside sobriety test results should be
    suppressed from evidence after defendant voluntary consented to
    performing such tests is without merit. People v. Lowe, 687
    P.2d 454 (1984).</P>
    <P>Evidence of refusal to take a blood or breath test is
    admissible in evidence at a revocation of license proceeding or
    at a trial for driving under the influence or while ability
    impaired, and the effect of subsection (3)(e) is to allow
    admission of such evidence in every case without a

    <P>
    <B>Subsection (2) authorizes only a permissive inference that
    defendant was under the influence of alcohol.</B>Because of the
    constitutional conflicts which arise with the use of
    presumptions in criminal cases and because of the central
    purposes behind the legislature's enactment of the presumption,
    subsection (2)(c) is properly construed to authorize only a
    permissive inference that the defendant was under the influence
    of alcohol. Barnes v. People, 735 P.2d 869 (Colo. 1987).</P>
    <P>Instruction which told jurors that they "must accept the
    presumption as if it had been factually established by the
    evidence" and that they could reject this presumption only if
    it was "rebutted by evidence to the contrary" created a
    mandatory and not a permissive presumption that the petitioner
    was under the influence of alcohol. Barnes v. People, 735 P.2d
    869 (Colo. 1987).</P>
    <P>
    <B>Both subsection (2) of this section and § 18-3-106 (2)

    <P>
    <B>Subsection (2)(c) is very specific in limiting the use of

    <B>Defendant's ability to attack validity of

    <P>
    <B>Jury could infer that the defendant was under the influence
    at the time of the offense</B>where the prosecution presented
    evidence that approximately three hours after the accident,
    defendant's blood alcohol level was above the statutory
    percentage. Because the circumstances at issue permitted the
    jury to make such inference, the extrapolation evidence offered
    to establish a still higher blood alcohol level was neither
    necessary nor relevant and the admission thereof was harmless
    error. People v. Emery, 812 P.2d 665 (Colo. App. 1990).</P>
    <P>
    <B>Presumption that defendant was under influence specifically

    the defendant's refusal to take sobriety and coordination

    the proof of prior convictions are clearly severable. Proof of
    prior convictions or the adjudication that the defendant is an
    habitual criminal do not involve substantive offenses, but
    merely provide for increased punishment of those whose prior
    convictions fall within the scope of these statutes. The
    important relation between the primary offenses and the prior
    convictions charged is, therefore, the sentence to be imposed,
    and the jury does not participate in that. Righi v. People, 145
    Colo. 457, 359 P.2d 656 (1961); Quintana v. People, 169 Colo.
    295, 455 P.2d 210 (1969).</P>
    <P>
    <B>Former convictions must be in separate counts of the
    information,</B>and then it appears to be the accepted practice
    that when arraignment is had, the defendant be fully advised of
    these counts in the information. Heinze v. People, 127 Colo.
    54, 253 P.2d 596 (1953); Quintana v. People, 169 Colo. 295, 455
    P.2d 210 (1969).</P>
    <P>
    <B>The use of the proof of convictions of second or more
    offenses cannot obtain until guilt of the substantive offense
    on trial is established.</B>Heinze v. People, 127 Colo. 54, 253
    P.2d 596 (1953); Quintana v. People, 169 Colo. 295, 455 P.2d
    210 (1969).</P>
    <P>
    <B>The same jury need not be utilized in both segments in the
    prosecution of a drunk driving charge aggravated by a charge of
    a prior conviction</B>within five years. Quintana v. People,
    169 Colo. 295, 455 P.2d 210 (1969).</P>
    <P>
    <B>However, proof may be offered to the same jury if a guilty
    verdict has been returned on the substantive count.</B>Heinze
    v. People, 127 Colo. 54, 253 P.2d 596 (1953).</P>
    <P>
    <B>Abuse of discretion to set aside guilty verdict on
    substantive offense and order another trial on second count of
    prior conviction.</B>Quintana v. People, 169 Colo. 295, 455
    P.2d 210 (1969).</P>
    <P>
    <B>When the sole question on remand from an appellate court
    involves the proof of an alleged prior conviction,</B>there is
    no reason to require the parties to retry the question of guilt
    of the primary offenses when the correctness of that
    determination is not challenged. There is nothing prejudicial
    involved in a limited new trial on the issue of the challenged
    prior conviction by a jury different from that which tried the
    issue of guilt of the primary offenses. Quintana v. People, 169
    Colo. 295, 455 P.2d 210 (1969).</P></ANNO-TEXT>

    <P>This section does not violate constitutional standards
    because the statute does not expressly require an evidentiary
    hearing on the issue of any alleged refusal to submit to some
    form of test to determine the alcohol content of a driver's
    breath or blood. The statutory requirement of a specific
    averment by the arresting officer that the driver refused to
    submit to an appropriate chemical analysis test makes the issue
    of refusal a question of fact, permitting the driver to present
    evidence contrary to such an averment and requiring the hearing
    officer to make a finding on such a factual issue based on all
    of the evidence. DuPuis v. Charnes, 668 P.2d 1 (Colo.

    <P>
    <B>Purpose of revocation penalty.</B>To encourage the suspected
    drunk driver to take a blood-alcohol test voluntarily, the
    implied consent statute imposed an automatic revocation
    penalty, with very few exceptions, on those who refused to take
    the test. Calvert v. State Dept. of Rev., 184 Colo. 214, 519
    P.2d 341 (1974).</P>
    <P>
    <B>Written notice required.</B>Former subsection (3)(b)
    required that the "person arrested" be given an explanation, in
    written form, of his rights and the probable consequences of
    refusing to submit to a test, in order that he may read and
    study the same before having to make a decision. Cantrell v.
    Weed, 35 Colo. App. 180, 530 P.2d 986 (1974); Cooper v.

    subsection (3) prior to 1983 repeal and reenactment).</P>
    <P>
    <B>Such notice must be physically offered to licensee at time
    of test.</B>Under former subsection (3)(b) notice in writing
    had to be physically handed or offered to the licensee
    contemporaneously with or prior to the officer's request for
    the sobriety test. Cantrell v. Weed, 35 Colo. App. 180, 530
    P.2d 986 (1974).</P>
    <P>Merely affording driver the opportunity to "read along"
    while the officer orally recited the form containing written
    notice of the consequences of refusal to submit to test was not
    sufficient to constitute written notice under former subsection
    (3)(b). Cantrell v. Weed, 35 Colo. App. 180, 530 P.2d 986
    (1974).</P>
    <P>Where the arresting officer testified unequivocally that he
    read the advisement form to the plaintiff and offered him the
    opportunity to read it for himself, but that the plaintiff
    refused to do so, the evidence was sufficient to support a
    hearing examiner's finding that the plaintiff was properly
    advised under former subsection (3)(b). Gilbert v. Dolan, 41
    Colo. App. 173, 586 P.2d 233 (1978).</P>
    <P>
    <B>How warning should be phrased.</B>The warning under former
    subsection (3)(b) had to be phrased so that a person of normal
    intelligence would understand the consequences of his actions.

    <P>
    <B>What licensee to be informed of.</B>The implied consent law
    required that the licensee be informed of both the hearing and
    the possibility of the revocation of the license. Vigil v.
    Motor Vehicle Div., 184 Colo. 142, 519 P.2d 332 (1974).</P>
    <P>A licensee was advised of the "probable consequences of
    refusal" under former subsection (3)(b) if he was informed that
    his license "might" be revoked. Hall v. Charnes, 42 Colo. App.

    (1966) warnings and he manifested his desire to call his
    attorney before deciding whether or not to submit to the test,
    but was not told that he had no such right, under these
    circumstances, the motorist should have been advised that the
    right to remain silent does not include the right to refuse to
    submit to the test or the right to prior consultation with an
    attorney. Calvert v. State Dept. of Rev., 184 Colo. 214, 519

    <B>The fact that the defendant was handcuffed and could neither
    touch nor feel the implied consent form</B>when it was read to

    1984).</P>
    <P>
    <B>Notice requirements of former subsection (3)(b) were not
    violated</B>by the fact that the advisement form read by an
    arresting officer to one stopped for suspicion of driving while
    intoxicated did not state that an individual could refuse to
    submit to a test if it would be medically inadvisable for him
    to do so or if the test to be given would not conform to the
    rules and regulations prescribed by the state board of health.

    <P>
    <B>The only valid justifications in the implied consent law for

    Motor Vehicle Div., 184 Colo. 142, 519 P.2d 332 (1974).</P>
    <P>
    <B>The implied consent law applied only to the misdemeanor

    188, 476 P.2d 980 (1970).</P>
    <P>The consent provision of this section applied only to
    misdemeanor offenses and not to felonies. People v. Acosta, 620

    <P>
    <B>One charged with felony could not claim consent to test was
    statutorily or constitutionally required.</B>Inasmuch as this
    section did not extend to felonies, a defendant charged with
    the felony of causing injury while driving under the influence
    of intoxicating liquor could not claim any statutory right to
    refuse to take a breathalyzer test. Since consent was neither
    statutorily nor constitutionally required, it was immaterial
    whether such defendant was inadequately advised or whether his
    consent was uninformed. People v. Sanchez, 173 Colo. 188, 476

    <P>
    <B>This section does not violate equal protection.</B>A
    rational basis exists for the statute's differential treatment
    of individuals who receive medical treatment at locations
    without breath testing equipment because providing such
    individuals with the option of choosing a breath test would
    cause delays in obtaining test samples. These delays would
    substantially hinder the state's legitimate public safety
    interest in securing timely alcohol test results for
    individuals suspected of driving while intoxicated. Evans v.
    Dept. of Rev., 159 P.3d 769 (Colo. App. 2006).</P>
    <P>
    <B>This section is not unconstitutionally vague.</B>The words
    and phrases of this section are readily comprehensible to
    persons of ordinary intelligence without further definition.
    The statute, in sufficiently clear terms, provides individuals
    with fair warning as to the circumstances under which a choice
    of tests is, and is not, available. Evans v. Dept. of Rev., 159

    <P>
    <B>Right to refuse.</B>Statutory, not constitutional, law
    provides the basis for determining whether there is any
    requirement that a motorist alleged to have violated drunk
    driving statute must be advised of right to refuse or to choose
    a type of blood alcohol test. Moreover, no such statutorily
    required advisement exists. Brewer v. Motor Vehicle Div., Dept.
    of Rev., 720 P.2d 564 (Colo. 1986); Smith v. Charnes, 728 P.2d

    <B>Use of refusal to consent to blood alcohol test as evidence
    of guilt does not violate fourth amendment right prohibiting
    unreasonable search.</B>Defendant argued that use of
    refusal-to-consent evidence penalized the exercise of a
    defendant's right to refuse consent. Refusal to consent to
    testing is a statutory right under the express consent statute.
    While criminalizing a refusal to consent would be improper, use
    of refusal to consent as evidence of guilt and automatic
    suspension of driving privileges for refusal would not
    impermissibly burden a defendant's fourth amendment
    constitutional right to be free from a warrantless search.

    <B>Failure to submit to test because wanting attorney is
    refusal.</B>Generally, when a suspect does not submit to the

    law. Drake v. Colo. Dept. of Rev., 674 P.2d 359 (Colo.

    <P>It is generally true that when a suspect does not submit to

    <P>
    <B>Taking of blood not violation of privilege against
    self-incrimination.</B>The privilege against self-incrimination
    protects an accused only from being compelled to testify
    against himself, or otherwise provide the state with evidence
    of a testimonial or communicative nature, and the withdrawal of
    blood and use of the analysis in a case does not involve
    compulsion to these ends. People v. Brown, 174 Colo. 513, 485

    <P>
    <B>Privilege against self-incrimination does not extend to
    results obtained from roadside sobriety test.</B>Such a test
    does not contravene the privilege by requiring the subject to
    divulge any knowledge he might have; the fact that the
    subject's guilt may be inferred from the results of the test
    goes to the probity of the testing method, not to its character
    as a supposed confession surrogate. People v. Ramirez, 199

    <B>Statutory changes not impermissible under

    driving while ability is impaired by alcohol, and the
    amendments made and adopted relating to implied consent during
    the course of legislative proceedings, amending what is now §
    42-4-1202, did not amount to an impermissible change in the

    <P>
    <B>Taking of blood is not unreasonable search and
    seizure.</B>Although it has been determined that the taking of

    (1974).</P>
    <P>
    <B>Taking of blood held reasonable search.</B>Notwithstanding
    the fact that the blood extraction for the purpose of
    administering blood-alcohol test took place in a nonmedical
    environment without a doctor or nurse present, where a record
    reveals that a highly qualified and experienced medical
    technologist took the blood sample in conformity with the
    department of health regulations and with no infringement upon
    the personal dignity of the defendant, the taking was well
    within the ambit of a reasonable search. People v. Mari, 187

    <P>
    <B>Statutory consent satisfies consent exception to fourth
    amendment warrant requirement.</B>By driving in the state,
    driver consented to the terms of this section, including its
    requirement that driver submit to a blood draw. That prior
    statutory consent eliminated the need for the trial court to
    assess the voluntariness of driver's consent at the time of the

    <P>
    <B>No constitutional right to withdraw statutory consent to

    <ANNO-TEXT>
    <B>Law enforcement officers cannot use a warrant to circumvent
    the expressed consent statute.</B>The expressed consent statute
    limits the circumstances in which DUI or DWAI suspects may be
    forced to undergo blood testing. The plain language of this
    statute does not create an exception for a warrant. Therefore,
    a suspect may not be forced to undergo testing unless the
    officer has probable cause to believe the suspect has committed
    criminally negligent homicide, vehicular homicide, assault in
    the third degree, or vehicular assault. People v. Raider, 2021
    COA 1, 490 P.3d 1079. 
    <P>
    <B>It is driver's external manifestations of unwillingness or
    outright refusal</B>to take chemical test for alcohol which are
    relevant under express consent statute, not driver's state of
    mind or later recollection of events. Boom v. Charnes, 739 P.2d
    868 (Colo. App. 1987), rev'd on other grounds, 766 P.2d 665

    <P>
    <B>Officer is not required to ascertain driver's subjective
    state of mind</B>in determining whether driver consents to
    chemical test for alcohol; objective manifestations of driver
    are enough to constitute refusal. Colgan v. State Dept. of
    Rev., 623 P.2d 871 (Colo. 1981); Boom v. Charnes, 739 P.2d 868
    (Colo. App. 1987), rev'd on other grounds, 766 P.2d 665 (Colo.

    <P>
    <B>Driver's actions not to be lightly construed as
    refusal.</B>An arresting officer should not lightly construe
    words and actions of a driver to constitute a refusal to be
    tested. Renck v. Motor Vehicle Div., 636 P.2d 1294 (Colo. App.
    1981).</P>
    <P>
    <B>In deciding whether there was a refusal to submit to a

    <P>It is the driver's external manifestations of unwillingness
    or his outright refusal to take the test which are relevant,

    <P>
    <B>Automobile driver's request to speak to attorney before
    taking chemical test</B>to determine blood alcohol level
    constituted refusal to take test as matter of law. Dikeman v.

    <P>
    <B>Inability to decide to submit to test constitutes
    refusal.</B>An inability to decide to submit to a test, after
    being fully advised that Miranda rights do not apply, will
    constitute a refusal. Stephens v. State Dept. of Rev., 671 P.2d
    1348 (Colo. App. 1983).</P>
    <P>
    <B>It was reasonable for arresting officer to take driver's
    silence to be a refusal of testing</B>where driver had not been
    unable to speak and had answered other questions but failed to
    speak only in response to the request to take a blood test. Poe
    v. Dept. of Rev., 859 P.2d 906 (Colo. App. 1993).</P>
    <P>
    <B>Arresting officer not required to compel performance of
    involuntary blood test</B>where driver had not been unable to
    speak and had answered other questions but failed to speak only
    in response to the request to take a test, making it reasonable
    for officer to take driver's silence to be a refusal of
    testing. Poe v. Dept. of Rev., 859 P.2d 906 (Colo. App.
    1993).</P>
    <P>
    <B>Breath test must be offered where blood test
    refused.</B>That driver appeared too intoxicated to take breath
    test after refusing blood test did not amount to refusal to
    take breath test. Officer was required to offer breath test
    despite his conclusion that defendant was not physically able
    to perform test due to intoxication. Sedlmayer v. Charnes, 767
    P.2d 754 (Colo. App. 1988).</P>
    <P>
    <B>Breath test suppressed as evidence as a result of officer's
    erroneous and coercive statement that defendant could lose his
    license for not taking breath test.</B>After being unable to
    comply with defendant's request for a blood test, the arresting
    officer warned that the defendant could lose his license for
    failure to take a breath test. Turbyne v. People, 151 P.3d 563
    (Colo. 2007).</P>
    <P>
    <B>Driver's initial refusal to take the test is sufficient
    grounds upon which to revoke</B>her license. Rogers v. Charnes,
    656 P.2d 1322 (Colo. App. 1982).</P>
    <P>
    <B>Revocation mandatory.</B>Creech v. State Dept. of Rev., 190
    Colo. 174, 544 P.2d 633 (1976).</P>
    <P>
    <B>Subsection (2)(a)(III), unlike subsection (2)(a)(I), does
    not impose any condition on an officer's testing request;
    instead, it governs a driver's duty to cooperate.</B>It does
    not provide a driver need only cooperate with requests made
    within two hours of driving. Rather, it requires that, if a law
    enforcement officer requests a test, the suspected drunk driver
    must cooperate with the request such that the sample of blood
    or breath can be obtained within two hours of the person's
    driving. Stumpf v. Colo. Dept. of Rev., 231 P.3d 1 (Colo. App.
    2009).</P>
    <P>Subsection (2)(a)(III) requires that drivers provide timely
    cooperation within a two-hour period if possible, but does not
    excuse their refusal beyond that period. This does not mean,
    however, that such requests can never give rise to revocation.
    Instead, requests made more than two hours after driving remain
    subject to the reasonable time limitation standard. Stumpf v.
    Colo. Dept. of Rev., 231 P.3d 1 (Colo. App. 2009).</P>
    <P>
    <B>Hearing officer properly found testing request to have been
    made within a reasonable time.</B>The request was made and
    refused by the driver less than three and one-half hours after
    person's driving. A blood test conducted three and one-half
    hours after driving is not incapable of yielding potentially
    relevant evidence. Stumpf v. Colo. Dept. of Rev., 231 P.3d 1
    (Colo. App. 2009).</P>
    <P>
    <B>The two-hour standard does not apply to a refusal to take a
    test.</B>The refusal to take a blood alcohol test is an
    independent cause for revoking driver's license. Therefore, so
    long as the request is within a reasonable time, a refusal to
    take the test may result in loss of a driver's license. Stumpf
    v. Colo. Dept. of Rev., 231 P.3d 1 (Colo. App. 2009).</P>
    <P>
    <B>A driver's refusal to submit to a test pursuant to the
    implied consent (now express consent) law is not
    irrevocable</B>and the driver may reconsider his decision.
    Zahtila v. Motor Vehicle Div., 39 Colo. App. 8, 560 P.2d 847
    (1977).</P>
    <P>
    <B>But licensee must inform officer of reconsideration and
    consent.</B>Although an attorney informs a police officer that
    she has advised her client to submit to a blood-alcohol test,
    unless the licensee informs the officer of his consent to the
    test, a prior refusal to take the test is grounds for the
    revocation of his license. McCampbell v. Charnes, 626 P.2d 762
    (Colo. App. 1981).</P>
    <P>After a driver has refused to submit to a test, recantation
    must be made to the arresting officer or other law enforcement
    officer in sufficient time to obtain a sample within two hours
    of the person's driving. The arresting officer is not obliged
    to wait with the suspect for two hours in case the suspect may
    wish to recant the refusal. If the officer has returned to
    duty, the refusal stands. Gallion v. Colo. Dept. of Rev., 155
    P.3d 539 (Colo. App. 2006), aff'd, 171 P.3d 217 (Colo.
    2007).</P>
    <P>When licensee initially agreed to submit to blood test but
    then refused test, it became obligation of licensee to tell
    officer he was willing to consent to an alternative test.
    Gonzales v. State Dept. of Rev., 728 P.2d 754 (Colo. App.
    1986).</P>
    <P>
    <B>A motor vehicle operator who has unequivocally refused a
    test may no longer retract the refusal</B>after the law
    enforcement officer has completed the duties prescribed by
    statute to deal with the refusal. Schulte v. Colo. Dept. of
    Rev., 2018 COA 140, 488 P.3d 419.</P>
    <P>
    <B>Service of the notice of revocation can be sufficient for an
    officer to disengage from requesting or directing a chemical
    test</B>but it is not a necessary predicate to disengaging.
    Schulte v. Colo. Dept. of Rev., 2018 COA 140, 488 P.3d 419.</P>
    <P>
    <B>Court concludes that there was not a refusal justifying
    revocation of license</B>when driver retracted refusal to take
    blood or breath test within two and one-half hours after
    driving. Pierson v. Colo. Dept. of Rev., 923 P.2d 371 (Colo.
    App. 1996).</P>
    <P>
    <B>Even absent other driving violations,</B>an investigatory
    stop is permissible when a police officer has a reasonable
    suspicion that the driver is committing or has committed a
    drunk driving offense. Peterson v. Tipton, 833 P.2d 830 (Colo.
    App. 1992).</P>
    <P>
    <B>Reasonable suspicion justifying initial stop</B>was
    furnished by nonverbal signal of gas station clerk who had
    called to report intoxicated customer preparing to drive away.
    Peterson v. Tipton, 833 P.2d 830 (Colo. App. 1992).</P>
    <P>
    <B>Motorist's refusal to submit to blood alcohol test and
    breath test</B>was not authorized by statute and was not
    excused by police's failure to establish statutory
    qualifications of blood technician to driver's satisfaction.
    Malveaux v. Colo. Dept. of Rev., 727 P.2d 875 (Colo. App.
    1986).</P>
    <P>
    <B>In the case of a vehicular assault, in order for an officer
    to require a test,</B>the motorist must first be given the
    opportunity to refuse consent to the test. People v. Maclaren,
    251 P.3d 578 (Colo. App. 2010).</P>
    <P>
    <B>In the case of a vehicular assault, failure of an officer to
    obtain consent prior to subjecting a motorist to a test under
    this section does not require suppression of the test result or

    <P>
    <B>Revocation of license upheld.</B>When plaintiff refused to

    <P>
    <B>Motorist who had agreed to take blood alcohol test until

    Connolly v. Dept. of Rev., 739 P.2d 927 (Colo. App. 1987).</P>
    <P>
    <B>Refusal is prerequisite for revocation proceeding.</B>A
    refusal to submit to an appropriate chemical analysis test to

  the judicial department and the behavioral health administration
  in the department of human services have provided the general
  assembly with a statement of the cost of the program, including
  costs of administration for the past and current fiscal year to
  include a proposed change in the assessment. The general assembly
  shall then consider the proposed new assessment and approve the
  amount to be assessed against each person during the following

  facilities that provide level I and level II programs as provided
  in subsection (3)(c) of this section must be transmitted to the
  state treasurer, who shall credit the fees to the fund. Upon
  appropriation by the general assembly, the money must be expended

  administration in the department of human services for the
  administration of the alcohol and drug driving safety program. In
  administering the alcohol and drug driving safety program, the
  judicial department is authorized to contract with any agency for

    <B>A finding of knowing or wilful conduct is sufficient</B>to

    <P>
    <B>One may be said to be guilty of wanton behavior
    when,</B>although the defendant may not have deliberately
    intended to injure anyone, he consciously chooses a dangerous
    course of action which to a reasonable mind creates a strong
    probability that injury to others will result. Martin v.
    People, 179 Colo. 237, 499 P.2d 606 (1972).</P>
    <P>
    <B>Wanton and wilful disregard not equivalent of wilful or
    intentional injury.</B>An allegation in a complaint that
    defendant was guilty of negligence consisting of wanton and
    wilful disregard of the rights and safety of others is not
    equivalent to an allegation of wilful or intentional injury.
    Healy v. Hewitt, 101 Colo. 92, 71 P.2d 63 (1937).</P>
    <P>
    <B>One who commits reckless driving necessarily has been guilty
    of careless driving,</B>for the greater degree of negligence
    includes the lesser. People v. Chapman, 192 Colo. 322, 557 P.2d
    1211 (1977).</P>
    <P>Both reckless and careless driving offenses consist of two
    elements: (1) The act of driving a motor vehicle; and (2) the
    state of mind in "disregard" of or "without due regard" for
    safety. People v. Chapman, 192 Colo. 322, 557 P.2d 1211
    (1977).</P>
    <P>In both reckless and careless driving statutes the essence
    of the mental element is disregard of safety in driving. In
    both it is the absence of care which renders the driving
    criminal. People v. Chapman, 192 Colo. 322, 557 P.2d 1211
    (1977).</P>
    <P>The two offenses differ only in that the degree of
    negligence required is far more culpable in reckless driving
    than in careless driving, although it falls short of
    intentional wrongdoing. People v. Chapman, 192 Colo. 322, 557

    People v. Esparza-Treto, 282 P.3d 471 (Colo. App. 2011).</P>
    <P>"Wanton or willful disregard" for safety under this section
    is essentially the same element as the "reckless" state of mind

    <P>
    <B>Reckless driving is not a lesser included offense

    <P>
    <B>Jury question in civil case.</B>Whether or not either of the
    drivers or both were negligent in violating this section and
    whether said negligence was the proximate cause of this
    accident, or whether it was caused by the joint and concurrent
    negligence of both, were questions of fact for the jury to

    <B>While the legislature has clearly not barred the holder of
    legal title from maintaining liability coverage,</B>it has
    nevertheless compelled a conditional vendee with an immediate
    right of possession to provide the statutorily required
    coverage and subjected the vendee to personal liability and
    criminal sanctions for failing to do so. Sachtjen v. Am. Family
    Mut. Ins. Co., 49 P.3d 1146 (Colo. 2002). 
    <P>
    <B>It is not the prosecution's burden to prove,</B>as an
    element of the offense, that an officer requested proof of
    insurance before an offender may be convicted under subsection
    (2). Rather, the prosecution's burden is to prove beyond a
    reasonable doubt that the offender was driving and that he or
    she had no insurance. People v. Martinez, 179 P.3d 23 (Colo.
    App. 2007).</P>
    <P>Because subsection (6) enacts a safeguard to protect drivers
    who have insurance but who are unable to produce evidence of it
    when stopped by an officer, and since the defendant never
    asserted or suggested during trial that he had insurance, the
    evidence was sufficient to support the conclusion that
    defendant was guilty under subsection (2). People v. Martinez,
    179 P.3d 23 (Colo. App. 2007).</P>
    <P>
    <B>Even though peace officer did not explicitly ask for proof
    of insurance, there was prima facie evidence of lack of
    insurance</B>when defendant did not produce proof of insurance
    and such documentation was not found during a search of the
    vehicle. People v. Espinoza, 195 P.3d 1122 (Colo. App.
    2008).</P>
    <P>
    <B>Under this section, the only circumstance in which a court
    may suspend half of the mandatory minimum fine</B>is when a
    defendant shows that he or she has obtained qualifying
    insurance. Nothing in the plain language of the statute
    provides an exception where a defendant represents that he or
    she has relinquished ownership of his or her car or is
    currently not driving. People v. Hard, 2014 COA 132, 342 P.3d

  <M>The general assembly hereby finds and declares that:</M>
  <P N="(1)(a)">(a)
  <M>The regulation of persons approaching controlled intersections
  is a matter of mixed state and local concern; and</M></P>
  <P N="(1)(b)">(b)
  <M>It is necessary, appropriate, and in the best interest of the
  state to reduce injuries, fatalities, and property damage
  resulting from collisions at controlled intersections between
  motor vehicles and persons who are not operating motor vehicles
  by allowing most persons approaching controlled intersections who
  are fifteen years of age or older or who are under fifteen years
  of age and accompanied by an adult and who are not operating
  motor vehicles to approach controlled intersections in the manner
  set forth in this section.</M></P>
  <P N="(2)(a)(I)">(2)
  <N></N>(a)
  <N></N>(I)
  <M>A pedestrian or a person who is fifteen years of age or older
  or who is under fifteen years of age and accompanied by an adult
  and who is operating a low-speed conveyance and approaching a
  controlled intersection with a stop sign shall slow down and, if
  required for safety, stop before entering the intersection. If a
  stop is not required for safety, the pedestrian or person
  operating a low-speed conveyance shall slow to a reasonable speed
  and yield the right-of-way to any traffic or pedestrian in or
  approaching the intersection. After the pedestrian or person
  operating a low-speed conveyance has slowed to a reasonable speed
  and yielded the right-of-way if required, the pedestrian or
  person operating a low-speed conveyance may cautiously make a
  turn or proceed through the intersection without
  stopping.</M></P>
  <P N="(2)(a)(II)">(II)
  <M>For purposes of this subsection (2)(a), a reasonable speed is
  ten miles per hour or less. A municipality, by ordinance, or a
  county, by resolution, may raise the maximum reasonable speed to
  twenty miles per hour if the municipality or county also posts
  signs at the intersection stating that higher speed
  limitation.</M></P>
  <P N="(2)(b)">(b)
  <M>A person who is fifteen years of age or older or who is under
  fifteen years of age and is accompanied by an adult and who is
  operating a low-speed conveyance and approaching a controlled
  intersection with an illuminated red traffic control signal shall
  stop before entering the intersection and shall yield to all
  other traffic and pedestrians. Once the person operating a
  low-speed conveyance has yielded, the person operating a
  low-speed conveyance may cautiously proceed in the same direction
  through the intersection or make a right-hand turn. When a red
  traffic control signal is illuminated, a person operating a
  low-speed conveyance shall not proceed through the intersection
  or turn right if an oncoming vehicle is turning or preparing to
  turn left in front of the person operating a low-speed
  conveyance.</M></P>
  <P N="(2)(c)">(c)
  <M>A person who is fifteen years of age or older or who is under
  fifteen years of age and is accompanied by an adult and who is
  operating a low-speed conveyance approaching an intersection of a
  roadway with an illuminated red traffic control signal may make a
  left-hand turn only if turning onto a one-way street and only
  after stopping and yielding to other traffic and pedestrians.
  However, a person operating a low-speed conveyance shall not turn
  left if an oncoming vehicle is turning or preparing to turn
  right.</M></P>
  <P N="(2)(d)">(d)
  <M>Notwithstanding any other provision of this subsection (2), if
  a county or municipality has placed a traffic sign or a traffic
  control signal at a controlled intersection and the traffic sign
  or traffic control signal provides instructions only to one or
  more specified types of low-speed conveyances, the operator of a
  low-speed conveyance to which the traffic sign or traffic control
  signal is directed shall obey the instructions provided by the
  sign or traffic control signal.</M></P>
  <P N="(2)(e)">(e)
  <M>If a county or municipality adopted a valid ordinance or
  resolution that regulates bicycles or electrical assisted
  bicycles substantially as described in subsections (2)(a.5),
  (2)(b.5), and (2)(c.5) of this section prior to May 3, 2018, that
  ordinance or resolution remains valid to the extent that it
  applies to the operation of bicycles or electrical assisted
  bicycles by persons who are under fifteen years of age and who
  are not accompanied by an adult.</M></P>
  <P N="(2.5)">(2.5)
  <M>This section supersedes any conflicting ordinance that a
  municipality, county, or city and county adopts, but nothing in
  this section affects the validity of any ordinance or resolution
  adopted by a municipality, county, or city and county that
  regulates the conduct of persons approaching controlled
  intersections and does not conflict with this section.</M></P>
  <P N="(3)">(3)
  <M>This section does not diminish or alter the authority of the
  department of transportation or the state transportation
  commission, as those entities are defined in section 43-1-102,
  regarding the department's or commission's authority to regulate
  motor vehicle traffic on any portion of the state highway system
  as defined in section 43-2-101 (1).</M></P>
  <P N="(3.5)">(3.5)
  <M>This section does not create any right for a pedestrian or the
  operator of a low-speed conveyance to travel on any portion of a
  roadway where travel is otherwise prohibited by state law or by
  an ordinance or resolution adopted by a municipality, county, or
  city and county.</M></P>
  <P N="(4)">(4)
  <M>As used in this section:</M></P>
  <P N="(4)(a)">(a)
  <M>"Controlled intersection" means an intersection of a roadway
  that is controlled by either a stop sign or a traffic control
  signal.</M></P>
  <P N="(4)(b)">(b)
  <M>"Low-speed conveyance" means:</M></P>
  <P N="(4)(b)(I)">(I)
  <M>A vehicle, as defined in section 42-1-102 (112), that is not a
  motor vehicle, as defined in section 42-1-102 (58), a low-power
  scooter as defined in section 42-1-102 (48.5), or a low-speed
  electric vehicle, as defined in section 42-1-102 (48.6);</M></P>
  <P N="(4)(b)(II)">(II)
  <M>A toy vehicle, as defined in section 42-1-102 (103.5), that is
  exclusively human-powered; or</M></P>
  <P N="(4)(b)(III)">(III)
  <M>An electric personal assistance mobility device or EPAMD, as
  defined in section 42-1-102 (28.7), or a device that would be an

    as enacted by SB 94-1, relevant cases construing that provision
    have been included in the annotations to this section. 
    <P>
    <B>A defendant may be charged with multiple offenses of eluding
    a police officer arising from a single criminal episode</B>when
    he or she has performed discrete acts of eluding one or more
    police officers, each constituting a new volitional departure
    in defendant's course of conduct. People v. McMinn, 2013 COA
    94, 412 P.3d 551.</P>
    <P>
    <B>Under double jeopardy principles,</B>defendant's four
    convictions for vehicular eluding do not merge with one
    another, and defendant's four convictions for eluding a police
    officer do not merge with one another because each officer was
    eluded during separate times at separate locations. People v.
    McMinn, 2013 COA 94, 412 P.3d 551.</P>
    <P>
    <B>A construction of this statute that permits a jury to
    consider factors such as the length of time or distance driven
    does not render it unconstitutionally vague.</B>People v. Sims,
    2020 COA 78, 474 P.3d 189.</P>
    <P>
    <B>Elude may simply be defined as "avoid",</B>"escape", or "to
    not be caught". People v. Sims, 2020 COA 78, 474 P.3d 189.</P>
    <P>
    <B>Fleeing on foot is included in the phrase "any other manner"
    of eluding,</B>and the maxim ejusdem generis does not limit
    eluding to only those situations in which the operator uses the
    motor vehicle to elude the police officer, particularly given
    that § 18-9-116.5 criminalizes vehicular eluding while
    recklessly operating a motor vehicle. People v. Espinoza, 195
    P.3d 1122 (Colo. App. 2008).</P>
    <P>
    <B>Eluding a police officer does not require a trick or evasive
    action.</B>A court may properly convict a defendant who drives
    a motor vehicle normally but refuses to stop. People v. Sims,
    2020 COA 78, 474 P.3d 189.</P>
    <P>Although defendant did not attempt to deceive the police
    officer, the jury could reasonably conclude that defendant was
    attempting to elude the officer. People v. Sims, 2020 COA 78,
    474 P.3d 189.</P>
    <P>
    <B>Section does not require immediate compliance.</B>The
    evidence was insufficient to sustain a conviction for violating
    this section when defendant did not accelerate and drove only
    two blocks before turning into a school parking lot, driving
    over a six-inch curb, stopping, and following the officer's
    directions to get out of the vehicle. People v. Procasky, 2019
    COA 181, 467 P.3d 1252.</P>
    <P>
    <B>Crime of eluding a police officer is not a lesser included

    <P>
    <B>If the basis of a conviction is eluding a police officer,
    this section merges with aggravated driving with a revoked

    violate equal protection of the laws because the conduct
    constituting a class 4 felony under this section (i.e., leaving
    the scene of an accident resulting in death) is distinguishable
    in type and degree from the conduct constituting a class 2
    traffic offense under § 42-4-1406 (i.e., failing to report an
    accident). People v. Rickstrew, 775 P.2d 570 (Colo. 1989).</P>
    <P>
    <B>This section and § 42-4-1402 cover accidents involving
    death, injuries, and property damage.</B>City of Aurora v.

    <P>
    <B>A county court has jurisdiction over the subject matter of
    offenses alleged to have been committed under this
    section.</B>People v. Griffith, 130 Colo. 475, 276 P.2d 559
    (1954).</P>
    <P>
    <B>Infractions of section are matters of general public concern
    and not purely local.</B>The investigation and apprehension of
    a violator of the requirements of this and § 42-4-1403 is not
    exclusively a local matter. Infractions of these provisions are
    of general public concern. Moreover, these requirements do not
    necessarily relate to traffic control, but provide certain
    necessary actions on the part of the motorist involved to be
    taken after an accident occurs to protect the life and property
    of the injured. When these offenses are charged they come under
    the general police power of the state and do not necessarily
    relate to regulation of motor vehicle traffic of a "local or
    municipal" nature, although occurring in a municipality. People
    v. Graham, 107 Colo. 202, 110 P.2d 256 (1941).</P>
    <P>
    <B>Fault and extent of damages are not issues.</B>This section
    and § 42-4-1403 do not contemplate that in a prosecution
    thereunder the court shall be concerned in determining where
    the fault lies. Nor may it be concerned about the extent of
    injuries to persons or damage to property resulting from an
    accident made the basis of such a prosecution. Those questions
    are referable to a prosecution under a different statute, or to
    a civil action for damages. It is not the accident, as such,
    therefore, that constitutes the offense. Weiderspon v. People,
    118 Colo. 529, 198 P.2d 301 (1948).</P>
    <P>
    <B>This section creates a strict liability offense</B>because
    the plain language does not require or imply a culpable mental
    state, the proscribed conduct does not necessarily involve a
    culpable mental state, and the fact that the offense is a
    felony is not determinative. Due process is not violated
    because the offense is against the public welfare. People v.
    Manzo, 144 P.3d 551 (Colo. 2006).</P>
    <P>
    <B>This section and § 42-4-1603 require a driver of a vehicle
    involved in an accident to identify himself or herself as the
    driver.</B>Unless the fact is reasonably apparent from the
    circumstances, the driver has an affirmative duty to identify
    that he or she was the one driving the motor vehicle. People v.
    Hernandez, 250 P.3d 568 (Colo. 2010).</P>
    <P>
    <B>The unit of prosecution for leaving the scene of an accident
    is the number of accident scenes, not the number of injured
    victims at those scenes;</B>consequently, where two people were
    injured at a single accident scene, defendant's conviction on
    two counts of leaving the scene of an accident violates the
    constitutional prohibition against double jeopardy. People v.

  demand of any court, a certificate showing that a specified
  accident report has or has not been made to the department solely
  to prove a compliance or failure to comply with the requirement
  that such a report be made to the department. This section shall
  not be construed to mean that reports of investigation or other

    <B>Annotator's note.</B>Since § 42-4-1610 is similar to §
    42-4-1410 as it existed prior to the 1994 amending of title 42
    as enacted by SB 94-1, relevant cases construing that provision

    <P>
    <B>Reports confidential in order to encourage
    compliance.</B>The provisions of this section are based upon a
    declared public policy announced by the general assembly.
    Public policy requires that motorists be encouraged to make
    full and frank compliance with the requirement for filing the
    reports under the uniform motor vehicle statutes, and makes any
    information therein contained unavailable for use except by the
    department, and the limited exceptions embraced in this
    section. Clark v. Reichman, 130 Colo. 329, 275 P.2d 952

    <P>
    <B>Distinction between confidential reports and police
    reports.</B>The confidentiality provision of this section
    distinguishes between reports required to be made "by any
    driver, owner, or person involved in any accident", which are
    not admissible in evidence, and police investigation reports,
    which are public records and which are admissible. People v.

    party are not part of either the notice or report requirements

    provision of this section, and law enforcement officers'
    testimony as to those statements are properly admissible at

  set forth in subsection (4) of this section, the arresting
  officer may, except when the provisions of paragraph (c) of this
  subsection (5) prohibit it, offer to give a penalty assessment
  notice to the defendant. At any time that a person is charged
  with the commission of any traffic infraction, the peace officer
  shall, except when the provisions of paragraph (c) of this
  subsection (5) prohibit it, give a penalty assessment notice to
  the defendant. Such penalty assessment notice shall contain all
  the information required by section 42-4-1707 (3) or by section
  42-4-1709, whichever is applicable. The fine or penalty specified
  in subsection (4) of this section for the violation charged and
  the surcharge thereon may be paid at the office of the department
  of revenue, either in person or by postmarking such payment
  within twenty days from the date the penalty assessment notice is
  served upon the defendant; except that the fine or penalty
  charged and the surcharge thereon shall be paid to the county if
  it relates to a traffic offense authorized by county ordinance.
  The department of revenue shall accept late payment of any
  penalty assessment up to twenty days after such payment becomes
  due. Except as otherwise provided in subparagraph (II) of this
  paragraph (a), in the case of an offense other than a traffic
  infraction, a defendant who otherwise would be eligible to be
  issued a penalty assessment notice but who does not furnish
  satisfactory evidence of identity or who the officer has
  reasonable and probable grounds to believe will disregard the
  summons portion of such notice may be issued a penalty assessment
  notice if the defendant consents to be taken by the officer to
  the nearest mailbox and to mail the amount of the fine or penalty
  and surcharge thereon to the department. The peace officer shall
  advise the person arrested or cited of the points to be assessed
  in accordance with section 42-2-127. Except as otherwise provided
  in section 42-4-1710 (1)(b), acceptance of a penalty assessment
  notice and payment of the prescribed fine or penalty and
  surcharge thereon to the department shall be deemed a complete
  satisfaction for the violation, and the defendant shall be given
  a receipt which so states when such fine or penalty and surcharge
  thereon is paid in currency or other form of legal tender. Checks

  officer issue a penalty assessment notice to a minor under the

  Should the defendant charged with an offense other than a traffic
  infraction accept service of the penalty assessment notice but
  fail to post the prescribed penalty and surcharge thereon within
  twenty days thereafter, the notice shall be construed to be a
  summons and complaint unless payment for such penalty assessment
  has been accepted by the department of revenue as evidenced by
  receipt. Should the defendant charged with a traffic infraction
  accept the notice but fail to post the prescribed penalty and
  surcharge thereon within twenty days thereafter, and should the
  department of revenue not accept payment for such penalty and
  surcharge as evidenced by receipt, the defendant shall be allowed
  to pay such penalty and surcharge thereon and the docket fee in
  the amount set forth in section 42-4-1710 (4) to the clerk of the
  court referred to in the summons portion of the penalty
  assessment notice during the two business days prior to the time
  for appearance as specified in the notice. If the penalty for a
  misdemeanor, misdemeanor traffic offense, or a petty offense and
  surcharge thereon is not timely paid, the case shall thereafter
  be heard in the court of competent jurisdiction prescribed on the
  penalty assessment notice in the same manner as is provided by
  law for prosecutions of the misdemeanors not specified in
  subsection (4) of this section. If the penalty for a traffic
  infraction and surcharge thereon is not timely paid, the case
  shall thereafter be heard in the court of competent jurisdiction
  prescribed on the penalty assessment notice in the manner
  provided for in this article for the prosecution of traffic
  infractions. In either case, the maximum penalty that may be

  <ANNO-NOTE>
    <ANNO-TEXT>
    <B>Annotator's note.</B>Since § 42-4-1701 is similar to §
    42-4-1501 as it existed prior to the 1994 amending of title 42
    as enacted by SB 94-1, relevant cases construing that provision
    have been included with the annotations to this section. 
    <P>
    <B>The simplified procedures of the penalty assessment statute
    do not impermissibly offend the due process clauses</B>of
    either the constitution of the state or the constitution of the
    United States. Since the penalty assessment statute does not
    deprive an offender accused of a traffic violation of his right
    to a trial, on the contrary, the statute not only expressly
    preserves the accused's right to a trial but also affords him
    an alternative procedure which he may accept or reject, and
    therefore the statute does not violate any constitutional
    rights. Cave v. Colo. Dept. of Rev., 31 Colo. App. 185, 501
    P.2d 479 (1972).</P>
    <P>Section 42-2-123 and this section give a licensee notice of
    the ramifications of his failure to appear and the forfeiture
    of his bond for traffic violation charge and due process
    requirements are satisfied. Lopez v. Motor Vehicle Div., 189
    Colo. 133, 538 P.2d 446 (1975).</P>
    <P>
    <B>Due process standard for using penalty assessment as
    conviction.</B>Through the provisions of § 42-2-121 (3), the
    general assembly has mandated a minimum standard of due process
    which must be followed before payment of a penalty assessment
    under this section may be used as a conviction for purposes of
    suspension or revocation of a driver's license pursuant to §
    42-2-123 (1)(a). Stortz v. Colo. Dept. of Rev., 195 Colo. 325,
    578 P.2d 229 (1978).</P>
    <P>
    <B>Speeding classifications constitutional.</B>Decision to
    treat higher rates of speeding as more serious making them
    criminal acts is within legislature's discretion and does not
    create a suspect class or infringe on a fundamental right.
    Drawing a distinction based on speed is rationally related to
    legislative purpose of safety and fuel conservation. People v.
    Lewis, 745 P.2d 668 (Colo. 1987).</P>
    <P>
    <B>Traffic violations not decriminalized.</B>The general
    assembly did not intend to decriminalize minor traffic
    violations by denominating them "misdemeanor traffic offenses"
    and prescribing a fine-only penalty scheme for certain grades
    of these offenses. City of Greenwood Vill. v. Fleming, 643 P.2d
    511 (Colo. 1982) (decided prior to 1982 amendments).</P>
    <P>
    <B>Jurisdiction of county courts includes offenses reclassified
    as "misdemeanor traffic offenses"</B>under this section.
    Phillips v. County Court, 42 Colo. App. 187, 591 P.2d 600
    (1979).</P>
    <P>
    <B>When points not assessable.</B>If a traffic violation does
    not appear on the summons, to be issued under the notice
    provisions of subsection (4)(a), and the offender is not
    advised by the arresting officer in reference to the points
    chargeable for the traffic violation, points cannot be assessed
    against him for that offense. Stortz v. Colo. Dept. of Rev.,
    195 Colo. 325, 578 P.2d 229 (1978).</P>
    <P>
    <B>Payment of ticket, and subsequent lack of protest, precludes
    challenge of conviction.</B>Where a party pays a traffic ticket
    without a court judgment or a signed acknowledgment of guilt,
    but does not challenge the validity of the conviction and
    affirms the accuracy of his driving record at a departmental
    hearing, the party may not then challenge the conviction.
    Martinez v. Dolan, 41 Colo. App. 513, 591 P.2d 588 (1978).</P>
    <P>
    <B>Failure of penalty assessment to contain points for traffic
    violation</B>in no way invalidates the penalty assessment, or a
    guilty plea entered thereon. Stortz v. Colo. Dept. of Rev., 195
    Colo. 325, 578 P.2d 229 (1978).</P>
    <P>
    <B>Section furthers policy against custodial arrests.</B>The
    modern policy against custodial arrests and favoring the
    issuance of citations and summonses is given effect by
    requiring the issuance of a penalty assessment notice or
    summons in ordinary traffic violations. People v. Clyne, 189
    Colo. 412, 541 P.2d 71 (1975), overruled in People v. Meredith,
    763 P.2d 562 (Colo. 1988).</P>
    <P>
    <B>Police have authority to make custodial arrest for driving
    without a license under this section and § 42-2-101.</B>People
    v. Meredith, 763 P.2d 562 (Colo. 1988) (overruling People v.
    Clyne, 189 Colo. 412, 541 P.2d 71 (1975) and People v. Stark,
    682 P.2d 1240 (Colo. App. 1984)).</P>
    <P>
    <B>Presumption of correctness of records held insufficient for
    suspending driving privileges.</B>Presumption of the
    correctness of department of revenue records indicating that a
    motorist charged with driving 41 miles per hour in a 30 mile
    per hour zone in a city had paid $15 to the municipal court
    clerk was insufficient for purposes of suspending the
    motorist's driving privileges where the evidence at the hearing
    established that there was neither a specific court judgment
    nor a signed acknowledgment of guilt as prescribed by
    subsection (4)(a) of this section and § 42-4-1505 (2)(a).

  article 6 of title 13, C.R.S., or before a county judge acting as
  a magistrate; except that, whenever a crime and a class A or
  class B traffic infraction or a crime and both such class A and
  class B traffic infractions are charged in the same summons and
  complaint, all charges shall be made returnable before a judge or
  magistrate having jurisdiction over the crime and the rules of
  criminal procedure shall apply. Nothing in this part 17 or in
  part 5 of article 6 of title 13, C.R.S., shall be construed to

  to such lesser charge.</M></P>
  <P N="(3)">(3)
  <M>The burden of proof shall be upon the people, and the traffic
  magistrate shall enter judgment in favor of the defendant unless
  the people prove the liability of the defendant beyond a
  reasonable doubt. The district attorney or the district
  attorney's deputy may, in the district attorney's discretion,
  enter traffic infraction cases for the purpose of attempting a
  negotiated plea or a stipulation to deferred prosecution or
  deferred judgment and sentence but shall not be required to so
  enter by any person, court, or law, nor shall the district
  attorney represent the state at hearings conducted by a
  magistrate or a county judge acting as a magistrate on class A or
  class B traffic infraction matters. The magistrate or county
  judge acting as a magistrate shall be permitted to call and

    Colo. 125, 286 P.2d 625 (1955).</P>
    <P>This section prevents the admission of evidence of
    conviction for failure to yield in violation of § 42-4-703 (3).
    That evidence may not be introduced at trial or during summary
    judgment and may not serve as the basis for issue preclusion on
    the question of violation of a statute. Bullock v. Wayne, 623
    F. Supp. 2d 1247 (D. Colo. 2009).</P>
    <P>
    <B>Evidence of convictions under this article are only
    permissible in a habitual traffic offender
    proceeding.</B>Alhilo v. Kliem, 2016 COA 142, 412 P.3d 902.</P>
    <P>
    <B>Unless §§ 42-2-201 to 42-2-208 are implicated, evidence of a
    driver's prior traffic convictions is not admissible in a civil
    action,</B>even if such convictions caused the driver's license
    to be suspended at the time of the accident that is the subject
    of the civil action. Absent an adjudication by the department
    of revenue that the driver was an habitual offender, the
    convictions are inadmissible for any purpose, including to show
    that the prior convictions giving rise to the suspension
    indicated a habit, practice, and pattern of disregard for
    traffic regulations. Lawrence v. Taylor, 8 P.3d 607 (Colo. App.
    2000).</P>
    <P>
    <B>Highly speculative assertion in personal injury action that
    plaintiff's decedent would have been convicted of driving under
    suspension had he survived, and thus qualify as an habitual
    offender under §§ 42-2-201 to 42-2-208, does not meet the
    exception in this section.</B>Thus, the decedent's prior
    traffic convictions were properly excluded at trial. Lawrence
    v. Taylor, 8 P.3d 607 (Colo. App. 2000).</P>
    <P>
    <B>Section prohibits admission of evidence of charge of
    violation.</B>By this section, the general assembly obviously
    intended, by prohibiting the admission in evidence in a civil
    action of the record of conviction of any person for violation
    of the traffic laws, to prohibit also the asking questions as
    to whether or not the plaintiff had been charged in justice's
    court with a violation of the state traffic laws. Ripple v.
    Brack, 132 Colo. 125, 286 P.2d 625 (1955).</P>
    <P>
    <B>No prejudice to defendant.</B>The medical witness stated:
    "An auto hit him in the back and he got a ticket for reckless
    driving." The statement is ambiguous; for that reason it was
    proper to clarify since the plaintiff did not receive a ticket,
    and the defendant's counsel did not move to strike the
    statement. The facts do not bring the motion for mistrial
    within the ambit of the proscription of the statute, since the
    statement made no mention of a "conviction", nor was any effort
    made to introduce a "record of the conviction of any person".

  <M>No person shall abandon any motor vehicle upon public

  such officer has reasonable grounds to believe has been abandoned
  shall require such motor vehicle to be removed or cause the same

  manner as to constitute an obstruction to traffic or proper
  highway maintenance, such officer or agency employee is
  authorized to cause the motor vehicle, vehicle, cargo, or debris
  to be moved to eliminate any such obstruction; and neither the
  officer, the agency employee, nor anyone acting under the
  direction of such officer or employee shall be liable for any
  damage to such motor vehicle, vehicle, cargo, or debris
  occasioned by such removal. The removal process is intended to
  clear the obstruction, but such activity should create as little
  damage as possible to the vehicle, or cargo, or both. No agency

    <B>Annotator's note.</B>Since § 42-4-1903 is similar to §
    42-4-612 as it existed prior to the 1994 amending of title 42
    as enacted by SB 94-1, a relevant case construing that
    provision has been included with the annotations to this
    section. 
    <P>
    <B>Section not applicable to parties in collision of two
    automobiles.</B>Where two automobiles were involved in a
    collision at an intersection, none of the parties to an action
    arising out of the collision are within the purview of this
    section; for the intent of the enactment was neither
    exclusively, nor in part, to protect any interest of either of
    them. Any violation of it did not constitute a breach of any
    statutory duty owed, either to the violator or to the other
    party. Its provisions, therefore, are not determinative of any
    action between them. Hamilton v. Gravinsky, 174 Colo. 206, 483
    P.2d 385 (1971).</P>
    <P>
    <B>Presence of school bus not determinative of negligence as
    matter of law.</B>The presence of the school bus at the
    intersection was a factor the jury could properly consider when
    making its determinations on the questions of the negligence of
    the respective parties to this case, under ordinary negligence
    principles; but its presence, and the existence of the statute
    regulating it, was not determinative, as a matter of law, of
    the issue of negligence. Hamilton v. Gravinsky, 28 Colo. App.
    408, 474 P.2d 185 (1970), aff'd in part and rev'd in part on
    other grounds, 174 Colo. 206, 483 P.2d 385 (1971).</P>
    <P>
    <B>Violation only makes one liable to person in class protected
    by section.</B>A statute or ordinance may, because of its
    title, preamble, history or otherwise, be construed as intended
    to protect only the interests of a particular class of
    individuals. If so, a violation of the enactment can make the
    actor liable only to a person of that class. Hamilton v.
    Gravinsky, 28 Colo. App. 408, 474 P.2d 185 (1970), aff'd in
    part and rev'd in part on other grounds, 174 Colo. 206, 483

  <M>The state board of education, by and with the advice of the
  executive director of the department, shall adopt and enforce
  regulations not inconsistent with this article to govern the
  operation of all school buses used for the transportation of
  schoolchildren and to govern the discharge of passengers from
  such school buses. Such regulations shall prohibit the driver of
  any school bus used for the transportation of schoolchildren from
  discharging any passenger from the school bus which will result
  in the passenger's immediately crossing a major thoroughfare,
  except for two-lane highways when such crossing can be done in a
  safe manner, as determined by the local school board in
  consultation with the local traffic regulatory authority, and
  shall prohibit the discharging or loading of passengers from the
  school bus onto the side of any major thoroughfare whenever
  access to the destination of the passenger is possible by the use
  of a road or street which is adjacent to the major thoroughfare.
  For the purposes of this section, a "major thoroughfare" means a
  freeway, any U.S. highway outside any incorporated limit,
  interstate highway, or highway with four or more lanes, or a
  highway or road with a median separating multiple lanes of
  traffic. Every person operating a school bus or responsible for
  or in control of the operation of school buses shall be subject
  to said regulations.</M>
  <P N="(2)">(2)
  <M>Any person operating a school bus under contract with a school
  district who fails to comply with any of said regulations is
  guilty of breach of contract, and such contract shall be canceled
  after notice and hearing by the responsible officers of such
  district.</M></P>
  <P N="(3)">(3)
  <M>Any person who violates any provision of this section commits
  a petty offense.</M></P>

  public transportation programs for pupil transportation under
  section 22-51-104 (1)(c), C.R.S.</M></P></SECTION-TEXT>

  <M>In addition to other information that the director may by rule

  <P N="(1)(a)(III)">(III)
  <M>If a vehicle shows a brand in its title history, or if the
  vehicle is subject to a brand, the department shall place the
  appropriate brand on the certificate of title. If the vehicle has
  multiple brands, the department shall place the most recent brand

  If the brand is from a certificate of title issued in another

  vehicle, the vehicle model, the type of vehicle, the year of
  manufacture of the vehicle, the type of fuel used by the vehicle,
  and other information as may be required by the department. For

  title for the vehicle, including the date of the lien, the
  original amount secured by the vehicle, the named lienee, and the
  county in which the lien appears of record if it is of public
  record. The department or authorized agent shall number
  certificates and electronic records consecutively by counties,
  beginning with number one. The certificate of title filed with
  the authorized agent is prima facie evidence of the contents of
  the record and that the person in whose name the certificate is
  registered is the lawful owner of the vehicle. Except as provided
  in section 42-6-118, the certificate remains effective after

    <P>This part is a recording act by which prior interests can be

    presumptive evidence of ownership of an automobile, but the

    <P>
    <B>Activity of the director of revenue in the issuance of a new

    <P>
    <B>Annotator's note.</B>Since § 42-6-109 is similar to §

    <B>To the extent this section and § 16-13-101 et seq. are

    forfeiture statute prevail and the timing of the delivery of
    the certificate of title was not dispositive. People v. One

    <B>Intent of section.</B>This section is intended to hold in

    the automobile to be sold until such time as the certificate of
    title is delivered to the purchaser. Guy Martin Buick, Inc. v.

    <B>Showing of mortgages on title certificates.</B>The mobility
    of motor vehicles and their frequent sale in states far distant
    from the county of the mortgage filing has resulted in a new
    method of protection by means of showing mortgages on the title
    certificate, which can be carried with the car, rather than by
    record in the files of a distant and probably unknown county.
    Under the policy of our law the requisite of clear title is the
    possession of a certificate free of lien. Title depends on
    receipt of such a certificate, and ignorance of mortgages must
    be proven by the certificate. First Nat'l Bank v. Chuck Lowen,
    Inc., 128 Colo. 104, 261 P.2d 158 (1953); Loye v. Denver United

    Colo. 320, 287 P.2d 976 (1955).</P>
    <P>
    <B>This section must be construed with § 42-6-131.</B>Under §
    42-6-131, the recognition of a foreign mortgage in Colorado
    depends not upon its being filed for record, but upon its
    appearing on the certificate of title. That section must be
    construed together with this section which provides that except
    in cases not here applicable no person shall sell a motor
    vehicle without delivering a certificate of title and that no
    purchaser shall acquire any right, title, or interest in a
    motor vehicle unless he shall first obtain from the transferor
    the certificate of title thereto. By virtue of that section, on
    failure of an out-of-state dealer to deliver such certificate,
    whether because it showed a mortgage on its face or because it
    was deposited with the mortgagee, the purchaser could acquire
    no title as against prior mortgagees, and his rights are
    subordinate to such as are valid. First Nat'l Bank v. Chuck
    Lowen, Inc., 128 Colo. 104, 261 P.2d 158 (1953); Federico v.

    required to transfer an interest in a motor
    vehicle.</B>Although a bank had a perfected security interest
    in an auto dealer's inventory, the interest was extinguished
    upon sale of the vehicle because the bank authorized the sale
    of the inventory. Under § 4-9-315, the bank was left with a
    security interest only in the proceeds of the sale. Therefore,
    a credit union that financed the purchase of the vehicle from
    the dealer had a security interest that prevails against the
    bank, even though the certificate of title was not conveyed to
    the credit union at the time of sale. Valley Bank &amp; Trust

    thereof noted on the certificate of title "substantially" in

    authorized agent and the notation by him of that fact on the

    of such mortgage. Loye v. Denver United States Nat'l Bank, 341
    F.2d 402 (10th Cir. 1965).</P>
    <P>
    <B>Notation of creditor as "owner" suffices.</B>A notation of

    <P>
    <B>The certificate of title act creates a system of notice

    <P>
    <B>Superiority of recorded lien.</B>A creditor cannot obtain a
    judicial lien superior to a transferee's interest, once the
    requirements for the recording of the lien on a motor vehicle
    set out in this section and § 42-6-120 are fulfilled. GMAC v.

    <P>
    <B>Mortgage cannot attach more value than amount noted on
    certificate.</B>Allowing a mortgage to attach having more value
    than the amount noted on the certificate of title would negate
    the purpose of this section and § 42-6-120, which is to make
    the certificate conclusive as to the rights of the parties with
    respect to notice of prior encumbrances. In re Grizaffi, 23
    B.R. 137 (Bankr. D. Colo. 1982).</P>
    <P>
    <B>Section inapplicable to foreign mortgages.</B>In view of §

    mortgages does not apply to foreign mortgages. First Nat'l Bank
    v. Chuck Lowen, Inc., 128 Colo. 104, 261 P.2d 158 (1953).</P>
    <P>
    <B>Persons with no right in vehicle not protected by
    section.</B>Where a party has no rights to a motor vehicle,
    having been divested of all ownership, he is not within the
    four categories of persons protected by the filing requirements
    of this section. People v. Armijo, 197 Colo. 91, 589 P.2d 935

  <COMMENT-HEAD>ANNOTATION</COMMENT-HEAD>
  <ANNO-NOTE>
    <ANNO-TEXT>
    <B>Annotator's note.</B>Since § 42-6-121 is similar to §
    42-6-120 as it existed prior to the 1994 amending of title 42
    as enacted by SB 94-1, relevant cases construing that provision
    have been included in the annotations to this section. 
    <P>
    <B>The purpose of the title act was to provide a simple and
    effective means of ascertaining the title to and interests in
    motor vehicles</B>and that means is an examination of the title
    certificate itself. The provision in the statute requiring the
    notation on the title certificate of the filed chattel mortgage
    was designed to make that certificate conclusive as to the
    rights of the parties with respect to the matter of notice of
    prior encumbrances. It is not the province of this court to
    give to the statute a narrow interpretation out of harmony with
    the designed purpose and intent of the general assembly. Loye
    v. Denver United States Nat'l Bank, 341 F.2d 402 (10th Cir.
    1965).</P>
    <P>The certificate of title act creates a system of notice
    filing in which the certificate merely indicates who may have a
    security interest. Further inquiry from the parties is
    necessary to determine the complete state of affairs. Yeager
    Trucking v. Circle Leasing, 29 B.R. 131 (Bankr. D. Colo.
    1983).</P>
    <P>
    <B>This section is intended to supersede the use of local files
    and records in providing notice of encumbrances</B>upon motor
    vehicles. Loye v. Denver United States Nat'l Bank, 341 F.2d 402
    (10th Cir. 1965).</P>
    <P>
    <B>The notation on a title certificate of the existence of an
    encumbrance is sufficient notice</B>to subsequent creditors.
    Loye v. Denver United States Nat'l Bank, 341 F.2d 402 (10th
    Cir. 1965).</P>
    <P>
    <B>Notation of creditor as "owner" suffices.</B>A notation of
    the creditor as "owner" on the certificate of title constitutes
    substantial compliance with this section. Yeager Trucking v.
    Circle Leasing, 29 B.R. 131 (Bankr. D. Colo. 1983).</P>
    <P>
    <B>Superiority of recorded lien.</B>A creditor cannot obtain a
    judicial lien superior to a transferee's interest, once the
    requirements for the recording of the lien on a motor vehicle
    set out in § 42-6-119 and this section are fulfilled. GMAC v.
    Martella, 22 B.R. 649 (Bankr. D. Colo. 1982).</P>
    <P>
    <B>Mortgage cannot attach more value than amount noted on
    certificate.</B>Allowing a mortgage to attach having more value
    than the amount noted on the certificate of title would negate
    the purpose of § 42-6-119 and this section, which is to make
    the certificate conclusive as to the rights of the parties with
    respect to notice of prior encumbrances. In re Grizaffi, 23
    B.R. 137 (Bankr. D. Colo. 1982).</P>
    <P>
    <B>The recording of a chattel mortgage on a motor vehicle in
    the wrong county does not render the mortgage lien void</B>so
    as to be vulnerable to attack by a trustee in bankruptcy. Loye
    v. Denver United States Nat'l Bank, 341 F.2d 402 (10th Cir.
    1965).</P>
    <P>
    <B>Application of uniform commercial code where automobiles
    held as inventory.</B>Where automobiles were held for sale as
    inventory, this section and § 42-6-119 did not apply to the
    security interest of the bank making a loan to the purchaser,
    and the provisions of article 9 of title 4 did apply. Guy
    Martin Buick, Inc. v. Colo. Springs Nat'l Bank, 32 Colo. App.
    235, 511 P.2d 912 (1973), aff'd, 184 Colo. 166, 519 P.2d 354
    (1974).</P>
    <P>
    <B>The Colorado Certificate of Title Act (CCTA) does not
    supersede § 4-9-317 (e) of the Uniform Commercial
    Code</B>because subsection (e) does not govern the manner or
    timing of the perfection of liens. It governs only the priority
    of a lien and is not inconsistent with the CCTA. In re Roser,
    613 F.3d 1240 (10th Cir. 2010).</P></ANNO-TEXT>

  <M>The lien of a mortgage or refinancing of a mortgage filed in
  the manner prescribed in section 42-6-121 or 42-6-129 shall
  remain valid and enforceable for a period of ten years after the
  filing of the certificate in the office of the director's
  authorized agent or until the discharge of the mortgage on the
  vehicle, if the discharge occurs sooner, except in the case of
  trailer coaches; truck tractors; multipurpose trailers, if known
  when filed; and motor homes, that are subject to the provisions
  of subsection (3) of this section. During the ten-year period or
  any extension of such period, the lien of the mortgage may be
  extended for successive three-year periods upon the holder of the
  mortgage presenting to the director's authorized agent of the
  county where the mortgage is filed or in the county where the
  owner resides a certification of extension of chattel mortgage,
  subscribed by the holder of the mortgage and acknowledged by the
  holder before an officer authorized to acknowledge deeds to real
  property, in which shall appear a description of the mortgage on
  the vehicle, to what extent it has been discharged or remains
  unperformed, and such other information respecting the mortgage
  as may be required by appropriate rule of the director to enable
  the director's authorized agent to properly record the
  extension.</M>
  <P N="(2)">(2)
  <M>Upon receipt of a mortgage extension, the authorized agent
  shall make and complete the electronic record of the extension as
  the director by rule may require within the director's or the
  authorized agent's motor and off-highway vehicle database and
  shall note the fact of the extension of the mortgage on the
  certificate of title, which may be filed electronically.
  Thereafter, the authorized agent shall return the certificate to
  the person shown on the certificate to be entitled to the
  certificate. If any mortgage other than one on a trailer coach;
  truck tractor; multipurpose trailer, if known when filed; or
  motor home has been filed for record and noted on the certificate
  of title and has not been released or extended within ten years
  after the date when the mortgage was filed in the office of the
  authorized agent, the person shown by the records in the
  director's office to be the owner of the motor or off-highway
  vehicle described in the certificate of title, upon filing an
  application, may request that the authorized agent remove
  references to the mortgages shown on the records. The authorized
  agent shall remove all reference to mortgages shown in the
  authorized agent's records to have been of record in the office
  of the authorized agent for more than ten years without being
  released or extended.</M></P>

  <M>Second or other junior mortgages.</M></CATCH-LINE>(1)
  <M>On and after July 1, 1977, a person who takes a junior
  mortgage on a motor or off-highway vehicle for which a Colorado
  certificate of title has been issued or filed may file the
  mortgage for public record and have the existence of the mortgage
  noted or filed on the certificate of title with like effect as in
  other cases, as required by this section.</M>
  <P N="(2)">(2)
  <M>The junior mortgagee or the holder of the mortgage shall file
  the mortgage as required by section 42-6-121 with the authorized
  agent of the county where the mortgagor of the motor or
  off-highway vehicle resides or where the vehicle is located with
  a written request to have the existence of the mortgage noted or
  filed on the certificate of title records of the authorized agent
  pertaining to the vehicle covered by the junior mortgage. Upon
  the filing of the mortgage, the authorized agent shall note in
  the record of the vehicle the day and hour when the mortgage was
  received by the agent, shall make and deliver a receipt for the
  mortgage to the person filing the mortgage, and shall file the
  mortgage as required under section 42-6-122. If there is more
  than one mortgage or lien on the motor or off-highway vehicle,
  the department's authorized agent may electronically transmit the
  mortgage or lien to the first mortgage or lienholder and notify
  the first mortgage or lienholder of any additional mortgages or
  liens.</M></P>
  <P N="(3)">(3)
  <M>The director's authorized agent, by registered mail, return
  receipt requested, shall make a written demand on the holder of
  the certificate of title, addressed to such person at the
  person's address as the same may appear in said written request,
  that such certificate be delivered to the authorized agent for
  the purpose of having noted on the certificate such second or
  junior mortgage. Within fifteen days after the receipt of such
  demand, the person holding such certificate shall either mail or
  deliver the same to such director's authorized agent or, if the
  person no longer has possession of the certificate, shall so
  notify the agent and, if the person knows, shall likewise inform
  the agent where and from whom such certificate may be procured.
  Upon the receipt of such certificate, the director's authorized
  agent shall complete an application for a new title and record
  the number thereof on the mortgage, as in the case of a first
  mortgage, and shall, as in the case of a first mortgage, issue
  and file a new certificate of title on which record the existence
  of all mortgages on the motor vehicle, including such second or
  junior mortgage, have been noted.</M></P>
  <P N="(4)">(4)
  <M>If a person lawfully in possession of a certificate of title
  to a motor or off-highway vehicle, upon whom demand is made for
  the delivery to the authorized agent, fails to deliver or mail
  the certificate of title to the authorized agent, the person is
  liable to the holder of the junior mortgage for all damage
  sustained by reason of the omission.</M></P></SECTION-TEXT>

    <B>Purpose, application, and limitations of section.</B>The
    purpose of this section, being to apprise a local purchaser of
    the existence of a foreign lien, it applies only to a regular
    and nonfraudulent foreign title, and its operation is limited
    to the protection of a local innocent purchaser where a foreign
    title is issued without notation of lien. Federico v. Universal

    <P>
    <B>Refusal to give effect to mortgage filed for record in
    foreign state.</B>In the first sentence of this section the
    general assembly has changed the prior law by refusing to give
    effect to a mortgage that is filed for record in a foreign
    state and nothing more, at least in a state which uses the
    system of certificates of title. Federico v. Universal C.I.T.
    Credit Corp., 140 Colo. 145, 343 P.2d 830 (1959).</P>
    <P>
    <B>Modified by second sentence of section.</B>If taken
    literally, the first sentence of this section would indicate
    that no foreign mortgage shall be enforceable against a
    subsequent purchaser for value in Colorado. However, the second
    sentence of the same section refers to the "certificate of
    title for such vehicle ... under the laws of ... any other
    state". Thus, it would appear that the second sentence modifies
    and thus limits the first sentence to application to mortgages
    originating in certificate of title states. Doenges-Glass, Inc.

    104, 261 P.2d 158 (1953).</P>
    <P>

  <M>Legislative declaration.</M></CATCH-LINE>(1)
  <M>The general assembly is acutely aware of the toll in human
  suffering and loss of life, limb, and property caused by
  negligence in the operation of motor vehicles in our state.
  Although it recognizes that this basic problem can be and is
  being dealt with by direct measures designed to protect our
  people from the ravages of irresponsible drivers, the general
  assembly is also very much concerned with the financial loss
  visited upon innocent traffic accident victims by negligent
  motorists who are financially irresponsible. In prescribing the
  sanctions and requirements of this article, it is the policy of
  this state to induce and encourage all motorists to provide for
  their financial responsibility for the protection of others, and
  to assure the widespread availability to the insuring public of
  insurance protection against financial loss caused by negligent
  financially irresponsible motorists.</M>
  <P N="(2)(a)">(2)
  <N></N>(a)
  <M>The general assembly hereby finds that motor vehicle accidents
  cause a substantial economic impact in lost wages, medical bills,
  and property destruction exacerbated by the following:</M></P>
  <P N="(2)(a)(I)">(I)
  <M>Some negligent motorists are uninsured or flee the scene of an
  accident.</M></P>
  <P N="(2)(a)(II)">(II)
  <M>Negligent motorists often attempt to avoid financial
  responsibility by means such as fleeing the state, concealing
  their whereabouts, or failing to update the address on their
  driver's license with the department of revenue, thereby
  frustrating service of process and preventing the innocent victim
  from accessing either the negligent driver's liability insurance
  policy or the uninsured motorist coverage the victim has
  purchased.</M></P>
  <P N="(2)(a)(III)">(III)
  <M>When innocent traffic accident victims cannot access either
  the negligent driver's automobile liability policy or their own
  uninsured motorist coverage, the burden of the uncompensated
  losses are borne by the taxpayer in the form of taxes for
  medicaid, by trauma facilities in the form of uncompensated
  hospital-related costs, and by the innocent victim.</M></P>
  <P N="(2)(b)(I)">(b)
  <N></N>(I)
  <M>The state of Colorado encourages the widespread availability
  of uninsured or underinsured motorist insurance by requiring
  every motor vehicle liability policy delivered or issued in this
  state to contain uninsured motorist coverage unless the named
  insured rejects such coverage in writing.</M></P>
  <P N="(2)(b)(II)">(II)
  <M>Because insurance benefits have been paid for by either the
  negligent driver or the innocent victim for the purpose of
  compensating the innocent victim for injuries or losses, the
  general assembly declares that it is necessary to simplify the
  process for an innocent victim to access the negligent driver's
  liability insurance policy or his or her own uninsured motorist
  coverage in order to prevent the burden from being borne by the
  taxpayer or the health-care system.</M></P>
  <P N="(2)(c)">(c)
  <M>Therefore, the general assembly declares that the policy of
  Colorado is that all motor vehicle liability policies shall
  require policyholders of an automobile liability policy to
  appoint their insurance carrier as an agent for the purpose of
  service of process in certain limited instances in accordance
  with section 42-7-414 (3), and to deem a defendant to be
  uninsured for purposes of uninsured or underinsured motorist
  coverage if the court deems service on the defendant's insurance
  company to be ineffective or insufficient.</M></P></SECTION-TEXT>

    <B>Subsection (12) of this section concerning motor vehicles
    shows the purpose of declaring that a person who owns the legal
    title to a vehicle shall be deemed the owner.</B>Registration
    can only be issued to the owner and in the event certain things
    occur, then the registration is to be cancelled and
    registration plates suspended, unless the owner makes a showing
    of beneficial responsibility, gives bond, or procures necessary
    insurance. Ferguson v. Hurford, 132 Colo. 507, 290 P.2d 229

    <B>Loss of consortium not separate injury required to be
    insured.</B>Nothing in § 10-4-319 (now § 10-4-609) and this

    consortium to be a separate bodily injury which must be insured
    against in all insurance policies. Arguello v. State Farm Mut.

    <P>
    <B>Subsection (2) of this section and § 10-4-609 (1), when read

    Assembly to provide a mechanism by means of which an insured
    might purchase insurance coverage for protection against loss
    caused by the conduct of a negligent and financially
    irresponsible motorist. Kral v. Am. Hardware Mut. Ins. Co., 784
    P.2d 759 (Colo. 1989).</P>
    <P>Insurance coverage is not based on the number of uninsured
    or underinsured tortfeasors causing an accident, nor must an

    for every driver involved in an accident with its insured.

    <P>
    <B>When considered together, subsection (3) of this section and
    § 10-4-609 reflect a clear legislative purpose</B>to place an
    injured party having uninsured motorist coverage in the same
    position as if the uninsured motorist had been insured. Any
    agreement to reduce the amount of benefits an insured might
    receive under an uninsured motorist clause of an insurance
    contract must be viewed in light of this legislative intent.

    <P>
    <B>Provision in insurance policy that allowed the insurer to
    set off benefits received from workers' compensation</B>was, in

  <M>Requirements to be complied with.</M></CATCH-LINE>(1)
  <M>Except as provided in section 42-7-417, no motor vehicle
  liability policy or operator's policy of liability insurance
  shall be issued in this state unless and until all of the
  requirements of subsection (2) of this section are met.</M>
  <P N="(2)">(2)
  <M>Every motor vehicle liability policy and every operator's
  policy of liability insurance accepted as proof under this
  article shall be subject to the following provisions whether or
  not contained therein:</M></P>
  <P N="(2)(a)">(a)
  <M>The liability of the insurance carrier under any such policy
  shall become absolute whenever loss or damage covered by such
  policy occurs, and the satisfaction by the insured of a final
  judgment for such loss or damage shall not be a condition
  precedent to the right or obligation of the carrier to make
  payment on account of such loss or damage. No fraud,
  misrepresentation, or other act of the insured in obtaining or
  retaining any such policy, or in adjusting a claim under any such
  policy, and no failure of the insured to give any notice, forward
  any paper, or otherwise cooperate with the insurance carrier
  shall constitute a defense as against the judgment creditor on
  any such judgment. The insurance carrier shall not be liable on
  any such judgment if it has not had reasonable notice of an
  opportunity to appear in and defend the action in which such
  judgment was rendered or if the judgment was obtained through
  collusion between the judgment creditor and the insured.</M></P>
  <P N="(2)(b)">(b)
  <M>The insurance carrier shall have the right to settle any claim
  covered by the policy, and if such settlement is made in good
  faith, the amount thereof shall be deductible from the limits of
  liability specified in the policy.</M></P>
  <P N="(2)(c)">(c)
  <M>No such policy shall be canceled except as provided in this
  section and section 42-7-416. The notice of cancellation shall be
  delivered to the named insured in person or mailed by certified
  mail, post-office receipt secured, or by registered mail prior to
  such cancellation. Unless the contract or policy of insurance
  provides for a shorter period of notice, said notice shall be so
  delivered or mailed to the address shown in the policy not less
  than thirty days prior to the date of cancellation. Proof of such
  mailing shall be sufficient proof of cancellation. Failure by any
  insurer to comply with the provisions for cancellation in this
  section and section 42-7-416 shall render invalid any such
  cancellation.</M></P>
  <P N="(2)(d)">(d)
  <M>No such policy shall be canceled or annulled as respects any
  loss or damage by any agreement between the carrier and the
  insured after the said insured has become responsible for such
  loss or damage, and any such cancellation or annulment shall be
  void.</M></P>
  <P N="(2)(e)">(e)
  <M>The policy may provide that the insured, or any other person
  covered by the policy, shall reimburse the insurance carrier for
  payment made on account of any loss or damage claim or suit
  involving a breach of the terms, provisions, or conditions of the
  policy. If the policy provides for limits in excess of the limits
  specified in section 42-7-103 (14), the insurance carrier may
  plead against any plaintiff, with respect to the amount of such
  excess limits of liability, any defenses which it may be entitled
  to plead against the insured, and any such policy may further
  provide for the prorating of the insurance thereunder with other
  applicable valid and collectible insurance.</M></P>

  insuring against bodily injury, death, or injury to or

  except a binder, a complete copy of the insurance policy shall be
  transmitted to the purchaser within thirty days of the purchase
  thereof; except that, when such policy is renewed, only a copy of
  the notice of renewal shall be required. Mailing of the copy of

  this section.</M></P>
  <P N="(3)(a)">(3)
  <N></N>(a)
  <M>The insurance carrier that issues a motor vehicle liability
  policy accepted as proof under this article shall include the

  irrevocably appoint the insurance carrier as the agent of the
  insured for service of process, pleadings, or other filings in a
  civil action brought against the insured or to which the insured
  has been joined as a defendant or respondent in any Colorado
  court if the cause of action concerns an incident for which the
  insured can possibly claim coverage. Subsequent termination of
  the insurance policy does not affect the appointment for an
  incident that occurred when the policy was in effect. The insured
  agrees that any such civil action may be commenced against the
  insured by the service of process upon the insurance carrier as
  if personal service had been made directly on the insured. The
  insurance carrier agrees to forward all communications related to
  service of process to the last-known e-mail and mailing address
  of the policyholder in order to coordinate any payment of claims
  or defense of claims that are required."</M></P>
  <P N="(3)(b)">(b)
  <M>If service of process is made on the insurance carrier under
  this subsection (3), the plaintiff shall cause the service of
  process to be made on the insurance carrier's registered

  <P N="(3)(c)">(c)
  <M>If service is obtained under this section, the venue for the

  <M>If service of process is made on the insurance carrier under
  this subsection (3) and the court enters judgment or the
  insurance carrier agrees to a settlement for the damages caused
  by the absent insured, the amount of the insurance carrier's
  liability shall not exceed the policy limits of the coverage. A
  judgment or settlement obtained using service of process on the
  carrier shall not bar the injured person from subsequently making
  personal service on the person who caused the injury and seeking
  additional remedies provided by law.</M></P>
  <P N="(3)(g)">(g)
  <M>Payment under the policy pursuant to this section shall not be

  <P N="(3)(h)">(h)
  <M>As used in this subsection (3), "reasonable effort" means

    <B>Purpose and provisions of section.</B>The purpose of this
    section is to foster and promote insurance coverage or, in the
    event of accident, a bond to insure financial responsibility.
    Its ultimate object is to provide compensation for innocent
    persons who might be injured through faulty operation of motor
    vehicles. Toward these ends, it provides inter alia that: (1)
    The insurance carrier's liability shall become absolute
    whenever loss or damage covered by the policy occurs; (2) that
    attempted satisfaction of final judgment by insured shall not
    be a condition precedent to the obligation of carrier to make
    payment; (3) that fraud, misrepresentation or other act of
    insured in obtaining the policy shall not constitute a defense
    available to the insurer against a judgment creditor; and (4)
    limitations upon the cancellation of a policy. Lucas v.

    representations of the insured with respect to his previous
    record, this section has no application and it is error to

    <B>The reason for this section</B>obviously is for the
    protection of persons within the border who may have reason to
    enforce liability upon the person so entering the state and
    using the highways thereof. Such a provision is not necessary,
    and does not apply to a person entering the state for the
    purpose of residing here in connection with an employment
    within the state, as obtains from the facts herein disclosed.
    For all purposes here material, the person so situated and
    residing within the state is in the same class as lifelong
    residents, and if such person is involved in an accident in
    this state and leaves the state shortly thereafter, it is
    immaterial. Warwick v. District Court, 129 Colo. 300, 269 P.2d

    <B>Nonresident subject to act and secretary of state is his

    section were intended to, and do, clearly indicate that
    whenever a resident of some other state crosses the border line
    into this state, whether on a drive across the country, or for
    a short sojourn, he has subjected himself to the provisions of
    the statute, and by such entry made the secretary of state his
    true and lawful attorney upon whom service may be had if the
    person is involved in any accident or collision upon the public
    highway while operating a motor vehicle thereon. If the time
    involved is only one hour or less in crossing a corner of the

  to be transported or shipped, a hazardous material by motor
  vehicle. Such rules and regulations may govern any safety aspect
  of the transportation of hazardous materials which the chief
  deems appropriate, including, but not limited to, the packaging,
  handling, labeling, marking, and placarding of hazardous
  materials and motor vehicles transporting hazardous materials,
  the qualifications of drivers of motor vehicles transporting
  hazardous materials, financial responsibility requirements, and

  <P N="(3)">(3)
  <M>In adopting such rules and regulations, the chief shall use as
  general guidelines the standards and specifications for the safe
  transportation of hazardous materials contained in federal
  statutes, and in the rules and regulations promulgated
  thereunder, as amended from time to time. The rules and

  interstate or intrastate commerce and shall be no more stringent
  than federal statutes and the rules and regulations promulgated
  thereunder.</M></P>
  <P N="(4)">(4)
  <M>The rules and regulations adopted by the chief pursuant to

  <M>The general assembly hereby finds, determines, and declares
  that the federal government has extended federal hazardous
  materials rules to agricultural producers in 49 CFR 173.5 in a
  way that would be unduly burdensome to agriculture without
  contributing significantly to public safety. The general assembly
  further finds, determines, and declares that the federal rules
  give explicit authority to the states to exempt themselves from
  the federal rules, and that this section is intended to exempt
  Colorado agriculture from such rules. The general assembly
  further finds, determines, and declares that it is imperatively
  necessary for the chief to adopt the rules required by this

  <M>Legislative declaration.</M></CATCH-LINE>It is hereby
  determined and declared that nuclear materials create a potential
  risk to the public health, safety, and welfare of the people of
  the state of Colorado. As an origination point of nuclear waste
  and a corridor state through which nuclear materials pass, the
  state has a duty to protect its citizens and environment from all
  hazards created by the transportation of nuclear materials within
  its borders. State and public participation in planning for the
  transport of nuclear materials and in the development of a plan
  to cope with all phases of the nuclear materials problem is
  essential in order to adequately prepare for potential nuclear
  incidents. To that end, it is the purpose of this part 4 and part
  5 of this article to require safe and environmentally acceptable
  methods of transporting nuclear materials within this state in a
  manner consistent with the laws of the United States and the
  rules and regulations promulgated by agencies of the United
  States.</SECTION-TEXT>

  <M>Any person who violates any provision of this part 4 or part 5
  of this article 20 or a rule or regulation promulgated by the
  chief pursuant to this part 4 and part 5 of this article 20,
  except for the violations enumerated in subsection (3) of this
  section and section 42-20-505, is subject to a civil penalty of
  not more than ten thousand dollars per day for each day during
  which the violation occurs. The penalty shall be assessed by the
  chief upon receipt of a complaint by any Colorado state patrol
  officer and after written notice and an opportunity for a hearing
  pursuant to section 24-4-105. Payment of a civil penalty under
  this section does not relieve any person from liability pursuant
  to article 11 of title 25, part 3 of article 15 of title 25, or
  article 22 of title 29. Any person who is assessed a penalty
  pursuant to this subsection (1) has the right to appeal the
  chief's decision by filing a notice of appeal with the court of
  appeals as specified in section 24-4-106 (11).</M>
  <P N="(2)">(2)
  <M>Any person who commits any of the acts enumerated in
  subsection (3) of this section is subject to the civil penalty
  listed in said subsection (3). Officers of the Colorado state
  patrol have the authority to issue civil penalty assessments for
  the enumerated violations. At any time that a person is cited for
  a violation enumerated in subsection (3) of this section, the
  person in charge of or operating the motor vehicle involved shall
  be given a notice in the form of a civil penalty assessment
  notice. The notice shall be tendered by the officer of the
  Colorado state patrol and must contain the name and address of
  the person, the license number of the motor vehicle involved, if
  any, the number of the person's driver's license, the nature of
  the violation, the amount of the penalty prescribed for the
  violation, the date of the notice, a place for the person to
  execute a signed acknowledgment of his or her receipt of the
  civil penalty assessment notice, a place for the person to
  execute a signed acknowledgment of liability for the cited
  violation, and such other information as may be required by law
  to constitute the notice as a complaint to appear in court should
  the prescribed penalty not be paid within ten days. Every cited
  person shall execute the signed acknowledgment of his or her
  receipt of the civil penalty assessment notice. The
  acknowledgment of liability shall be executed at the time the
  cited person pays the prescribed penalty. The person cited shall
  pay the civil penalty specified in subsection (3) of this section
  for the violation involved at the office of the department of
  revenue either in person or by postmarking such payment within
  ten days of the citation. The department of revenue shall accept
  late payment of any penalty assessment up to twenty days after
  the payment becomes due. If the person cited does not pay the
  prescribed penalty within ten days of the notice, the civil
  penalty assessment notice shall constitute a complaint to appear
  in court unless payment for the penalty assessment has been
  accepted by the department of revenue as evidenced by receipt,
  and the person cited shall, within the time specified in the
  civil penalty assessment notice, file an answer to this complaint
  with the county court for the county in which the penalty
  assessment was issued. The attorney general shall represent the
  Colorado state patrol if so requested by the Colorado state
  patrol.</M></P>
