  <COMMENT-HEAD>UNIFORM UNINCORPORATED NONPROFIT ASSOCIATION ACT
  <NL></NL>PREFATORY NOTE</COMMENT-HEAD>
  <COMMENT-TEXT>
    <P>This Act reforms the common law concerning unincorporated,
    nonprofit associations in three basic areas -- authority to
    acquire, hold, and transfer property, especially real property;
    authority to sue and be sued as an entity; and contract and
    tort liability of officers and members of the association.</P>
    <P>At common law an unincorporated association, whether
    nonprofit or for-profit, was not a separate legal entity. It
    was an aggregate of individuals. In many ways it had the
    characteristics of a business partnership.</P>
    <P>This approach obviously created problems. A gift of real
    property to an unincorporated association failed because no
    legal entity existed to receive it. For example, a gift of
    Blackacre to Somerset Social Club (an unincorporated, nonprofit
    association) would fail because in law there is no legal entity
    to receive title. Some courts in time became uncomfortable with
    this result. Some construed such a gift as a grant to the
    officers of the association to hold the real estate in trust
    and manage it for the benefit of the members of the
    association. Later, some legislatures provided various
    solutions, including treating the association for these
    purposes as an entity.</P>
    <P>Proceedings by or against an unincorporated association
    presented similar problems. If it were not a legal entity, each
    of the members needed to be joined as party plaintiffs or
    defendants. Class action offered another approach. Again courts
    and legislatures, especially the latter, provided solutions.
    "Sue and be sued" statutes found their way on the law books of
    most states.</P>
    <P>Unincorporated associations, not being legal entities, could
    not be liable in tort, contract, or otherwise for conduct taken
    in their names. On the other hand, their members could be.
    Courts borrowed from the law of partnership the concept that
    the members of the association, like partners, were
    co-principals. As co-principals they were individually liable.
    Again courts and legislatures, responding to concerns of their
    constituents about this result, modified these rules. Courts
    found that, in large membership associations, some members did
    not have the kind of control or participation in the decision
    process that made it reasonable and fair to view them as
    co-principals. Legislatures also took steps. Perhaps most
    striking are the statutes adopted in many states in the last
    decade excusing officers, directors, members, and volunteers of
    nonprofit organizations from liability for simple negligence.
    There is great variety in the details; a few statutes condition
    the immunity on the association carrying appropriate insurance
    or qualifying under Internal Revenue Code Section 501(c).</P>
    <P>Related to liability is the question of enforcement of a
    judgment obtained against an unincorporated association, its
    members, and its property. If fewer than all members are liable
    in contract or tort, the property that members own jointly or
    in common may not be seized in execution of a judgment without
    severing the interest of those who are liable from those who
    are not. Again, courts using "joint debtor," "common property,"
    and "common name" statutes fashioned more workable solutions.
    Some legislatures have also addressed the problem directly. For
    these purposes, unincorporated associations have been treated
    as legal entities -- like a corporation.</P>
    <P>What is striking about the legislative treatment of these
    and other legal issues concerning unincorporated, nonprofit
    associations is that no state appears to have addressed them in
    a comprehensive, integrated, and internally consistent
    manner.</P>
    <P>This Act deals with a limited number of the major issues
    relating to unincorporated, nonprofit associations in an
    integrated and consistent manner.</P>
    <P>The American Bar Association first issued its Model
    Nonprofit Corporation Act in 1964; it was most recently revised
    in 1987. The act deals comprehensively with nonprofit
    corporations, including troublesome questions of governance and
    membership. This Act, on the other hand, does not treat these
    and other questions. Enactment of this Act would leave these
    matters to a jurisdiction's common law or its statutes on the
    subject. It should be noted, too, that many states have
    statutes on special kinds of unincorporated, nonprofit
    associations, such as churches, mutual benefit societies,
    social clubs, and veteran's organizations. Which of these acts
    should be repealed and which retained in whole or part may
    require careful consideration.</P>
    <P>This Act applies to all unincorporated, nonprofit
    associations. Nonprofit organizations are often classified as
    public benefit, mutual benefit, or religious. For purposes of
    this Act, it is unnecessary to treat differently these three
    categories of unincorporated, nonprofit associations. Unlike
    some state laws, it is not confined to the nonprofit
    organizations recognized as nonprofit under Section 501(c) (3),
    (4), and (6) of the Internal Revenue Code. There is no
    principled basis for excluding any nonprofit association.
    Therefore, the Act covers unincorporated philanthropic,
    educational, scientific, and literary clubs, unions, trade
    associations, political organizations, cooperatives, churches,
    hospitals, condominium associations, neighborhood associations,
    and all other unincorporated, nonprofit associations. Their
    members may be individuals, corporations, other legal entities,
    or a mix.</P>
    <P>The Act is designed to cover all of these associations to
    the extent possible. To the extent a jurisdiction decides to
    retain statutes dealing with specific kinds of nonprofit
    associations, this Act will supplement existing legislation. As
    is pointed out in the Comments, a state electing to adopt this
    Act will need to examine carefully its statutes to determine
    which its wants to repeal, which to amend, and which to
    retain.</P>
    <P>The basic approach of the Act is that an unincorporated,
    nonprofit association is a legal entity for the purposes that
    the Act addresses. It does not make these associations legal
    entities for all purposes. It is left to the courts of an
    adopting state to determine whether to use this Act by analogy
    to conclude that an association is a legal entity for some
    other purpose.</P>
    <P>It should be noted, too, that many of the provisions are
    intended to be supplemented by a jurisdiction's existing law.
    For example, Section 5 (numbered as section 7-30-105 in C.R.S.)
    which provides for the filing of a statement of association
    authority, does not provide details concerning the filing
    process. It leaves to other law such details as whether the
    filing officer returns a copy marked "filed" and stamps the
    hour and date thereof, and the amount of the filing fee.</P>
    <P>Two sections are bracketed as optional -- Section 12
    (numbered as section 7-30-112 in C.R.S.) on venue and Section
    13 (numbered as section 7-30-113 in C.R.S.) on service of
    process. A jurisdiction may decide that its present rules are
    consistent with the entity view of an association and provide
    the appropriate rule. Therefore, it would not adopt Sections 12
    and 13 (numbered as sections 7-30-112 and 7-30-113 in C.R.S.).
    Both sections deal with only a part of the questions of venue
    and service of process. This means that if they are adopted
    they are only a part of the jurisdiction's law on the subject.
    And perhaps they should be placed in the court rules or
    statutes on those subjects instead of in the state's code with
    the other sections of this Act.</P>
    <P>A nonprofit organization wanting a comprehensive governance
    structure might consider incorporating under a nonprofit
    corporation statute, particularly one that follows the format
    of the ABA Model Nonprofit Corporation Act. These statutes
    provide, among other things, comprehensive governance
    provisions. As this Act contains none, adoption of a
    substantial charter and bylaws would be required to obtain
    similar internal rules and structure.</P>
    <P>There has been concern that this Act may deter nonprofit
    organizations from incorporating and that failure to
    incorporate would deprive the public of protections
    incorporation would provide. Clearly, incorporation does
    provide governmental involvement that this Act does not.</P>
    <P>Most jurisdictions regulate solicitation by charitable
    organizations. Many of these are comprehensive. See, for
    example, Ill. Ann. Stat. ch. 23, Sections 100-5121 (Smith-Hurd
    1992); Minn. Stat. Ann. Sections 309.50-309.61 (West 1992);
    Uniform Management of Institutional Funds Act.</P>
    <P>These statutes frequently require, among other things,
    filing of a comprehensive statement with the attorney general
    before soliciting funds, including a copy of contracts with any
    professional fundraisers, and registration of professional
    fundraisers. A range of civil and criminal sanctions are
    provided. These statutes apply to all persons soliciting for
    charitable purposes, incorporated or not. In short, this Act's
    nonprofit associations are covered.</P>
    <P>It should be noted, too, that a nonprofit corporation or
    unincorporated, nonprofit association is not the only choice.
    The Uniform Law Foundation, like many Illinois foundations, is
    organized as a charitable trust. Ill. Ann. Stat. ch. 14,
    Sections 51-69, (Smith-Hurd 1992); Uniform Supervision of
    Trustees for Charitable Purposes Act. Finally, it should be
    repeated that this Act is needed for the informal nonprofit
    organizations that do not have legal advice and so may not
    consider whether to incorporate.</P>

  <COMMENT-TEXT>
    <P>1.
    <M>With respect to relations external to a nonprofit
    association, whether a person is a member of the organization
    determines principally a member's responsibility to third
    parties. Internally, whether a person is a member might
    determine specified rights and responsibilities, including
    access to facilities, voting, and obligation to pay dues. This
    Act is concerned only with determining whether a person is a
    member for purposes of external relations, such as liability to
    third parties on a contract of the nonprofit association.
    Therefore, "member" is defined in terms appropriate to these
    purposes. "Member" includes a person who has sufficient right
    to participate in the affairs of a nonprofit association so
    that under common law the person would be considered a
    co-principal and so liable for contract and tort obligations of
    the nonprofit association.</M></P>
    <P>The definition may reach somewhat beyond decisions of some
    courts. Either participation in the selection of the leadership
    or in the development of policy is enough. Both are not
    required. This broad definition of member ensures that the
    insulation from liability is provided in all cases in which the
    common law might have imposed liability on a person, simply
    because the person was a member.</P>
    <P>2.
    <M>A fundraising device commonly used by many nonprofit
    associations is the membership drive. In most cases the
    contributors are not members for purposes of this Act. They are
    not authorized to "participate in the selection of persons
    authorized to manage the affairs of the nonprofit association
    or in the development of policy." Simply because an association
    calls a person a member does not make the person a member under
    this Act.</M></P>
    <P>Section 6 (numbered as section 7-30-106 in C.R.S.)
    nevertheless protects "a person considered to be a member by a
    nonprofit association" even though the person is not within the
    definition of member in paragraph (subsection) (1).</P>
    <P>3.
    <M>The role of a member in the affairs of an association is
    described as "may participate in the selection" instead of "may
    select or elect" the governing board and officers and "may
    participate ... in the development of policy" instead of "may
    determine" policy. This accommodates the Act to a great
    variation in practices and organizational structures. For
    example, some nonprofit associations permit the president or
    chair to name some members of the governing board, such as by
    naming the chairs of principal committees who are designated ex
    officio members of the governing board. Similarly, the role in
    determination of policy is described in general terms. "Persons
    authorized to manage the affairs of the association" is used in
    the definition instead of president, executive director,
    officer, member of governing board, and the like. Given the
    wide variety of organizational structures of nonprofit
    association to which this Act applies and the informality of
    some of them the more generic term is more appropriate.</M></P>
    <P>4.
    <M>"Person" instead of individual is used to make it clear that
    associations covered by this Act may have individuals,
    corporations, and other legal entities as members.
    Unincorporated, nonprofit trade associations, for example,
    commonly have corporations as members. Some national and
    regional associations of local government officials and
    agencies have governmental units or agencies as
    members.</M></P>
    <P>5.
    <M>Paragraph (Subsection) (2) defines "nonprofit association."
    The model American Bar Association acts deal with both
    for-profit and nonprofit corporations. Unincorporated,
    for-profit organizations are largely covered by the uniform
    partnership acts. The differences between for-profit and
    nonprofit, unincorporated organizations are so significant that
    it would be impractical to cover both in a single act.
    Therefore, this Act deals only with nonprofit
    organizations.</M></P>
    <P>6.
    <M>The term "nonprofit association" is used instead of
    "association" for several reasons. The risk that this Act when
    placed in a state's code would be construed to apply to both
    nonprofit and for-profit associations should thus be avoided.
    Acts dealing with one kind of association when placed in a code
    have sometimes lost their identification and been inadvertently
    applied to the other kind where the term "association" alone
    was used. For example, the New York Joint-Stock Association Act
    of 1894 used the term "association," which it defined to
    include only for-profit organizations. "Association" was held
    in 1938 to include an unincorporated political party and the
    act applied to it. Democratic Organization of Richmond County

    (1938). Subsequent decisions applied the act to other
    unincorporated, nonprofit organizations. The use of "nonprofit
    association" instead of merely "association" should also avoid
    the risk of this Act being improperly used to develop a common
    law rule by analogy from this Act to apply in a case involving
    a for-profit association. Roscoe Pound, Common Law and
    Legislation, 21 Harv. L. Rev. 383 (1908); Robert F. Williams,
    Statutes as Sources of Law Beyond their Terms in Common Law
    Cases, 50 Geo. Wash. L. Rev. 554 (1982).</M></P>
    <P>Legal issues concerning unincorporated, for-profit
    associations that are not partnerships and so not controlled by
    a partnership act would be governed by a state's other
    statutory or common law. Resort to one of the two partnership
    acts for the purposes of developing a common law rule by
    analogy would be appropriate. Resort for this purpose to this
    Act in the case of an unincorporated, for-profit association
    would not be appropriate.</P>
    <P>7.
    <M>Two or more persons is the common statutory requirement to
    constitute an unincorporated, nonprofit association. New
    Jersey, on the other hand, requires that there be seven or more
    members to be an association under its laws. This Act suggests
    the smaller number -- two. Consideration was given to
    specifying "one" instead of "two." For example, the developer
    of a condominium may have created a condominium association as
    an unincorporated nonprofit association. Before any units are
    sold the developer as owner of all units has all of the
    memberships in the association. Should it be treated as a
    nonprofit association under this Act from the beginning? It
    should not. Can one person be "joined by mutual consent for a
    common purpose?" To ask the question would seem to be to answer
    it. If the concern is to give the developer the entity
    protections provided by this Act, it is very likely that it
    already has some protection because it is a business
    corporation. Nevertheless, the number is placed in brackets, in
    part, to raise the question whether the number should be one or
    two or even a larger number.</M></P>
    <P>The members must be joined together for a common purpose.
    Several states provide that they be "joined together for a 
    <B>stated</B>common purpose" (emphasis added). Because of the
    informality of many ad hoc associations, it is prudent not to
    impose the requirement that the common purpose be "stated."
    Very probably, it is the small, informal, ad hoc associations
    and those third parties affected by them that most need this
    Act.</P>
    <P>8.
    <M>"Nonprofit" is not defined. A common definition -- it is an
    association whose net gains do not inure to the benefit of its
    members and which makes no distribution to its members, except
    on dissolution -- does not work for all nonprofit associations.
    Consumer cooperatives, for example, make distributions to their
    members; but they are not for-profit organizations. Those
    consumer cooperatives not organized under specific state or
    federal laws need the benefits of this Act.</M></P>
    <P>It is instructive to note that the drafting committee for
    the ABA Model Nonprofit Corporation Act finally determined that
    it could not develop a satisfactory definition of
    nonprofit.</P>
    <P>9.
    <M>The final sentence of paragraph (subsection) (2) is adapted
    from Section 201(d)(1) of Revised Uniform Partnership Act
    (RUPA). This stresses that more than common ownership and use
    is required. For example, that three families own a lake
    cottage and share its use does not make the three families a
    nonprofit association. Paragraph (Subsection) (2) precludes
    arrangements that are merely common ownership from being a
    nonprofit association under this Act.</M></P>

    <M>This section is adapted from Uniform Commercial Code Section
    1-103. The reference in Section 1-103 to "the law merchant" and
    its examples of supplementary rules, such as those of principal
    and agent and estoppel, were deleted as irrelevant or
    incomplete and unnecessary. This change in language does not
    manifest any change in substance.</M></P>
    <P>2.
    <M>This Act contains no rules concerning governance. However,
    recourse to rules of governance must be had to apply some of
    the Act's rules. For example, whether a nonprofit association
    is liable under a contract made for it by an individual depends
    on whether the individual had the necessary authority to act as
    agent. Was the individual given the authority by someone
    empowered by the nonprofit association to give the authority?
    To decide a case like this a court must resort to the rules of
    the nonprofit association or, if there are none applicable or
    none at all, to the common law or other statutory law of the
    jurisdiction.</M></P>
    <P>3.
    <M>Efforts were made to develop default internal rules of
    governance -- applicable if an association had none or none
    that were applicable. This effort demonstrated the complexity
    and difficulty of fashioning rules that would reasonably fit a
    wide variety of nonprofit associations -- large and small,
    public benefit, mutual benefit, and religious, and of short and
    indefinite duration. It was thought best to leave this question
    to other law of the jurisdiction.</M></P>

    <M>Subsection (a) (numbered as subsection (1) in C.R.S.) is
    based on Section 3-102(8), Uniform Common Interest Act. It
    reverses the common law rule. Inasmuch as an unincorporated,
    nonprofit association was not a legal entity at common law, it
    could not acquire, hold, or convey real or personal property.
    Harold J. Ford, Unincorporated Non-Profit Associations 1-45
    (Oxford Univ. Press 1959), 15 A.L.R. 2d 1451 (1951); Warburton,
    The Holding of Property by Unincorporated Associations,
    Conveyancer 318 (September-October 1985).</M></P>
    <P>2.
    <M>This strict common law rule has been modified in various
    ways in most jurisdictions by courts and statutes. For example,
    courts have held that a gift by will or inter vivos transfer of
    real property to a nonprofit association is not effective to
    vest title in the nonprofit association but is effective to
    vest title in the officers of the association to hold as
    trustees for the members of the association. Matter of
    Anderson's Estate, 571 P. 2d 880 (Okla. App. 1977).</M></P>
    <P>A New York statute specifies that a grant by will of real or
    personal property to an unincorporated association is effective
    if within three years after probate of the will the association
    incorporates. McKinney's N.Y. Estates, Powers, &amp; Trust Law,
    Section 3-1.3 (1981).</P>
    <P>California gives any "unincorporated society or association
    and every lodge or branch of any such association, and any
    labor organization" full right to acquire, hold, or transfer
    any "real estate and other property as may be necessary for the
    business purposes and objects of the society," and acquire and
    hold any property not so necessary for 10 years. California
    Corporations Code, Title 3, Unincorporated Associations,
    Section 20001 (West 1991).</P>
    <P>As is the case with many of the problems created by the view
    that an unincorporated association is not an entity the
    statutory solutions are often partial -- limited to special
    circumstances and associations. Subsection (a) (numbered as
    subsection (1) in C.R.S.) solves this problem for all nonprofit
    associations, for all kinds of transactions, and for both real
    and personal property.</P>
    <P>3.
    <M>Even if a nonprofit association's governing documents
    provide that it "may not acquire real property," subsection (a)
    (numbered as subsection (1) in C.R.S.) makes effective a
    transfer of Blackacre to the association. A different result
    would obviously disrupt real estate titles. The remedy for this
    violation of internal rules lies not in preventing title from
    passing but, as with other organizations, in an action by
    members against their association and its appropriate officers
    to undo the transaction.</M></P>
    <P>4.
    <M>Subsection (b) (numbered as subsection (2) in C.R.S.) is a
    necessary corollary of subsection (a) (numbered as subsection
    (1) in C.R.S.) and, thus, it may be unnecessary. However,
    several states expressly provide that an unincorporated,
    nonprofit association may be a legatee, devisee, or
    beneficiary. See, for example, Md. Estates &amp; Trusts Code
    Ann. Section 4-301 (1991). Therefore, it is desirable to
    continue this as an express rule. Subsection (b) (numbered as
    subsection (2) in C.R.S.) applies to both trusts and contracts.
    Not all state statutes apply expressly to both.</M></P>

    <M>This section is based on Revised Uniform Partnership Act

    Unincorporated Associations, Section 20002 (West 1991), is
    similar.</M></P>
    <P>2.
    <M>A statement of authority need not be filed to conclude an
    acquisition of or to hold real property. It is concerned only
    with the sale, lease, encumbrance, and other transfer of an
    estate or interest in real property. For this, it should, but
    need not, be filed. The filing provides important
    documentation.</M></P>
    <P>3.
    <M>Inasmuch as the statement relates to the authority of a
    person to act for the association in transferring real
    property, subsection (b) (numbered as subsection (2) in C.R.S.)
    requires that the statement be filed or recorded in the office
    where a transfer of the real property would be filed or
    recorded. This is usually the county in which the real estate
    is situated. This is where a title search concerning the real
    estate would be conducted. RUPA Section 303 provides for
    central filing, such as with the secretary of state, but its
    statement of partnership authority concerns authority of
    partners generally, not just with respect to real
    estate.</M></P>

    <M>"Filed" and "recorded" are bracketed to direct an enacting

    <P>5.
    <M>Subsection (c)(2) (numbered as subsection (3)(b) in C.R.S.)
    may present a problem for small, ad hoc, nonprofit
    associations. They may have no fixed office address. They may
    meet in the homes of their leaders. However, if they distribute
    literature or file petitions they are likely to have a mailing
    address.</M></P>
    <P>6.
    <M>Subsection (c)(3) (numbered as subsection (3)(c) in C.R.S.)
    permits the statement to identify as the person who can act for
    the association one who holds a particular office, such as
    president. This designation relieves the association from the
    need to make additional filings on each change of officers.
    Under local title standards and practices the transferee and
    filing or recording office are likely to require a certificate
    of incumbency if the statement designates the holder of an
    office.</M></P>
    <P>7.
    <M>Subsection (c)(4) (numbered as subsection (3)(d) in C.R.S.)
    requires the statement to document the authority of the person
    granted power to deal with the nonprofit association's real
    property and of the person authorized to execute the statement
    of authority.</M></P>
    <P>8.
    <M>Subsection (d) (numbered as subsection (4) in C.R.S.) is
    designed to reduce the risk of fraud and to reflect law and
    practice applicable to other organizations. It requires someone
    other than the person authorized to deal with the real property
    to execute the statement of authority on behalf of the
    nonprofit association.</M></P>
    <P>9.
    <M>Subsection (f) (numbered as subsection (6) in C.R.S.) makes
    a statement inoperative five years after its most recent
    recording or filing. This prevents a statement whose recording
    or filing is unknown by the association's current leadership
    from being effective. Reliance on a filing or recording this
    old is, in effect, not in good faith.</M></P>
    <P>10.
    <M>Subsection (g) (numbered as subsection (7) in C.R.S.) is
    based on RUPA Section 303(h). Its obvious purpose is to protect
    good faith purchasers for value without notice who rely on the
    statement, including those who acquire a security interest in
    the real property. There remains, of course, the risk that the
    statement itself was unauthorized.</M></P>

    <P>1.
    <M>At common law a nonprofit association was not a legal entity
    separate from its members. Borrowing from the law of
    partnership, the common law viewed a nonprofit association as
    an aggregate of its members. The members are co-principals.
    Subsection (a) (numbered as subsection (1) in C.R.S.) changes
    that. It makes a nonprofit association a legal entity separate
    from its members for purposes of contract and tort.</M></P>
    <P>2.
    <M>This Act does not deal with liability of a member or other
    person acting for a nonprofit association for their own
    conduct. With respect to contract and tort Section 6 (numbered
    as section 7-30-106 in C.R.S.) leaves that to the other law of
    the jurisdiction enacting this Act.</M></P>
    <P>3.
    <M>Subsections (b) through (e) (numbered as subsections (2)
    through (5) in C.R.S.) are applications to common cases of the
    basic principle in subsection (a) (numbered as subsection (1)
    in C.R.S.). Because a nonprofit association is made a separate
    legal entity, its members are not co-principals. Consequently
    they are not liable on contracts or for torts for which the
    association is liable. Subsection (b) (numbered as subsection
    (2) in C.R.S.) specifies that result with respect to
    contracts.</M></P>
    <P>4.
    <M>Subsection (b) (numbered as subsection (2) in C.R.S.)
    applies the principle in subsection (a) (numbered as subsection
    (1) in C.R.S.) to relieve members and others from vicarious
    liability for the contracts of a nonprofit association.</M></P>
    <P>5.
    <M>Subsections (a) and (b) (numbered as subsections (1) and (2)
    in C.R.S.) eliminate a risk that existed under common law. An
    agent makes an implied warranty of authority to the other
    contracting party. If the purported principal does not exist,
    the agent obviously breaches the warranty. Because an
    unincorporated, nonprofit association was not a legal entity;
    one purporting to act for it breached this implied warranty.
    Smith &amp; Edwards v. Golden Spike Little League, 577 P. 2d
    132, 134 (Utah 1978). Subsection (b) (numbered as subsection
    (2) in C.R.S.) treats a nonprofit association as a legal
    entity; therefore, an agent who acts for it within her
    authority does not breach the warranty.</M></P>

    <M>"Merely" because a person is a member does not make the
    person liable on an association's contract. This formulation
    means that there are special circumstances that may result in
    liability. For example, a member may expressly become a party
    to a contract with the nonprofit association. Subsection (b)
    (numbered as subsection (2) in C.R.S.) relieves members only of
    their vicarious liability. Liability for one's own conduct is
    left to the other law of the jurisdiction.</M></P>
    <P>An agent with authority from a nonprofit association who
    negotiates a contract without disclosing the agent's
    representative status is liable on the contract. Under agency
    law an agent acting within the agent's scope of authority for
    an undisclosed or partially disclosed principal is personally
    liable on the contract along with the principal, unless the
    other contracting party agrees not to hold the agent liable.

    <P>Courts have pierced the corporate veil of nonprofit
    corporations. Comment, Piercing the Nonprofit Corporate Veil,
    66 Marq. L. Rev. 134 (1984). Section 6 (numbered as section
    7-30-106 in C.R.S.) makes a nonprofit association a legal
    entity for these purposes. Therefore, as a matter of its other
    law a jurisdiction enacting this Act may appropriately apply
    this doctrine to a nonprofit association. In Macaluso v.
    Jenkins, 95 Ill. App. 3d 461, 420 N.E.2d 251 (1981), the
    president of a nonprofit corporation was found to have so
    commingled its funds and assets with his own and those of a
    business corporation he controlled and have treated them as his
    own for his benefit that the corporate veil must be pierced to
    promote justice. He was found liable for a debt contracted in
    the name of the nonprofit corporation. See also Harry G. Henn
    &amp; John R. Alexander, Law of Corporations, pp. 344-352 (West
    3d ed. 1983); Alfred F. Conard, Corporations in Perspective,
    pp. 424-433 (Foundation Press, 1976).</P>
    <P>7.
    <M>An example of a partial statutory solution of members'
    liability for contracts of a nonprofit association is
    California Corporations Code, Title 3, Nonprofit Associations,
    Section 21100 (West 1991). It relieves members from liability
    for "debts or liabilities contracted or incurred by the
    association in the acquisition of lands or leases or the
    purchase, leasing, designing, planning, architectural
    supervision, erection, contraction, repair, or furnishing of
    buildings or other structures, to be used for purposes of the
    association." As noted earlier, partial and uncoordinated
    statutory solutions of common law problems are typical.</M></P>
    <P>8.
    <M>Subsection (c) (numbered as subsection (3) in C.R.S.)
    applies the principle in subsection (a) (numbered as subsection
    (1) in C.R.S.) to relieve members and others from liability for
    torts for which the nonprofit association is liable. Inasmuch
    as Section 6 (numbered as section 7-30-106 in C.R.S.) provides
    that a member is not a co-principal, the member cannot be
    considered to be an employer of the employee who committed the
    tort. Again, only relief from vicarious liability is
    provided.</M></P>
    <P>Liability of a member or other person who acts for the
    nonprofit association is governed by other law of the
    jurisdiction. That an employer is liable for a tort committed
    by its employee does not excuse the employee.</P>
    <P>9.
    <M>The immunity from vicarious liability provided by
    subsections (b) and (c) (numbered as subsections (2) and (3) in
    C.R.S.) does not depend on the remedy sought. Whether it is for
    damages for breach of contract or tort, unjust enrichment, or
    the like the immunity is provided.</M></P>
    <P>10.
    <M>Since the mid 1980's all states have enacted laws providing
    officers, board members, and other volunteers some protection
    from liability for their own negligence. The statutes vary
    greatly as to who is covered, for what conduct protection is
    given, and the conditions imposed for the freedom from
    liability. Some apply only to nonprofit corporations. State
    Liability Laws for Charitable Organizations and Volunteers
    (Nonprofit Risk Management &amp; Insurance Institute, 1990);
    Developments, Nonprofit Corporations, 105 Harv. L. Rev. 1578,
    1685-1696 (1992).</M></P>
    <P>The 1987 Texas act, for example, relieves directors,
    officers, and other volunteers from liability for simple
    negligence that causes death, damage, or injury if the
    volunteer acted in the scope of her duties for a charitable
    organization exempt under Internal Revenue Code Section
    501(c)(3) or (4). The act also limits the amounts that may be
    recovered from an employee or the organization if the
    organization carries requisite liability insurance. The
    constitutionality of the provision relieving volunteers from
    liability has been questioned under Article I, Section 13 of
    the Texas Constitution -- the Open Courts provision. Note, The
    Constitutionality of the Charitable Immunity and Liability Act
    1987, 40 Baylor L. Rev. 657 (1988). Some statutes premise all
    relief upon the organization having specified liability
    insurance.</P>
    <P>Section 6 (numbered as section 7-30-106 in C.R.S.) does not
    affect these statutes. As noted earlier Section 6 deals only
    with vicarious liability. These statutes concern liability for
    one's own conduct.</P>
    <P>11.
    <M>Although not a concern of Section 6 (numbered as section
    7-30-106 in C.R.S.), perhaps it should be noted that nonprofit
    organizations have been held liable for tortious acts and
    omissions not only of employees but also of members. In Guyton
    v. Howard, 525 So.2d 948 (Fl. App. 1988) a nonprofit
    organization was held liable for the negligence of members who
    acted for the organization in conducting an initiation that
    resulted in injury.</M></P>
    <P>12.
    <M>Subsection (d) (numbered as subsection (4) in C.R.S.)
    applies the principle in subsection (a) (numbered as subsection
    (1) in C.R.S.) to reverse the common law rule that the
    negligence of an employee of an association is imputed to its
    members. A member as co-principal was vicariously responsible
    for an employee's conduct within the scope of the employee's
    duties. Section 6 (numbered as section 7-30-106 in C.R.S.),
    however, makes the nonprofit association a legal entity. Thus,
    a member is not a co-principal and the employee's negligence is
    not imputed to a member.</M></P>
    <P>Because the employee's negligence is not imputed, the
    member's suit against the nonprofit association for negligence
    by the employee is not subject to the defense of contributory
    negligence.</P>
    <P>Some courts treated large nonprofit associations as entities
    for some purposes and so did not impute the negligence of an
    employee to a member. Therefore, a member could recover from
    the association. Marshall v. International Longshoreman's and
    Warehouseman's Union, 57 Cal.2d 781, 371 P.2d 987 (1962);
    Judson A. Crane, Liability of an Unincorporated Association for
    Tortious Injury to a Member, 16 Vand. L. Rev. 319, 323
    (1963).</P>
    <P>13.
    <M>Subsection (e) (numbered as subsection (5) in C.R.S.)
    applies the principle in subsection (a) (numbered as subsection
    (1) in C.R.S.) to reverse the common law rule that a member may
    not sue the member's unincorporated, nonprofit association. A
    member as co-principal is logically a defendant as well as a
    plaintiff in such an action. The logic is that one may not sue
    oneself.</M></P>
    <P>Subsection (a) (numbered as subsection (1) in C.R.S.) makes
    an unincorporated nonprofit association a legal entity.
    Therefore, a member is separate from the nonprofit association.
    There is thus no logical obstacle to either suing the other. A
    nonprofit association may, for example, sue a member for
    delinquent dues. See, for example, Section 6.13 ABA Nonprofit
    Corporation Act (1987).</P>
    <P>14.
    <M>The Texas Supreme Court recently overruled the common law
    rule and held that a member may sue the unincorporated,
    nonprofit association of which the person is a member. Cox v.
    Thee Evergreen Church, 836 S.W.2d 167 (Tex. 1992). The court
    also overturned the Texas common law rule that the negligence
    of an employee is imputed to a member. The court referred to a
    statute authorizing a nonprofit association to sue and be sued
    and other Texas statutes giving entity status for limited
    purposes to unincorporated, nonprofit associations. It did not,
    however, rely on them in overturning the historic common law
    rule. It simply found the old rule not suitable for present
    times. The court also followed recent developments in other
    courts.</M></P>
    <P>15.
    <M>Section 6 (numbered as section 7-30-106 in C.R.S.) relieves
    from vicarious liability not only members but also certain
    others. Persons who are "authorized to participate in the
    management of the affairs of the nonprofit association" are
    protected. Persons within this group -- largely directors and
    officers, however denominated -- are likely also to be members
    as defined in Section 1(1) (numbered as section 7-30-101 (1) in
    C.R.S.), and protected as such. If they are not members (i.e.
    not co-principals) they should not be found liable at common
    law. Section 6 (numbered as section 7-30-106 in C.R.S.) extends
    protection to this group out of abundant caution. It is
    possible that a court might misapply the common law rationale
    for liability to hold a non-member manager vicariously liable.
    Section 6 (numbered as section 7-30-106 in C.R.S.) prevents
    that somewhat remote possibility.</M></P>
    <P>Section 6 (numbered as section 7-30-106 in C.R.S.) also
    extends protection to a person who is not within the definition
    of "member" in Section 1(1) (numbered as section 7-30-101 (1)
    in C.R.S.) but is "considered to be a member by the nonprofit
    association." A person within this clause is one who does not
    have the relationship to the nonprofit association that would
    permit a finding under the common law that the person is a
    co-principal. Also the person is not a director, officer, or
    manager within the preceding phrase. That a person not within
    the two preceding phrases but within the third phrase might be
    found vicariously liable seems quite remote. Nevertheless,
    Section 6 (numbered as section 7-30-106 in C.R.S.) accords this
    person protection.</P>
    <P>As noted earlier, Section 6 (numbered as section 7-30-106 in
    C.R.S.) concerns vicarious liability only. Liability for one's
    own conduct is covered by other law of the enacting
    jurisdiction.</P>

  <COMMENT-TEXT>
    <P>1.
    <M>Subsection (a) (numbered as subsection (1) in C.R.S.)
    broadly recognizes the right of a nonprofit association to
    participate as an entity in judicial, administrative, and
    governmental proceedings, and in arbitration and mediation on
    behalf of it and its members. It may sue and be sued. Many
    states have enacted statutes granting unincorporated
    associations these rights. Many have rejected the argument that
    these acts made an unincorporated, nonprofit association a
    separate legal entity for other purposes.</M></P>
    <P>2.
    <M>Ohio Rev. Code Ann. Section 1745.01 (Baldwin 1991) provides
    that an unincorporated association may "sue or be sued as an
    entity under the name by which it is commonly known and
    called." This formulation has an element that subsection (a)
    (numbered as subsection (1) in C.R.S.) does not have -- a
    description of the association name to be used. Maryland
    requires that the unincorporated association have a "group
    name." Md. Estates &amp; Trust Code Ann. Section 6-406(a) -
    (1991). As some of the informal nonprofit associations may not
    have fixed on a name but need the benefit of the rule,
    subsection (a) (numbered as subsection (1) in C.R.S.) does not
    require that it have a name.</M></P>
    <P>3.
    <M>Subsection (b) (numbered as subsection (2) in C.R.S.)
    describes an association's standing to represent the interests
    of its members in a proceeding. It is the federal standing
    rule. Hunt v. Washington Apple Advertising Comm'n, 432 U.S.
    333, 343, 97 S. Ct. 2434, 53 L.Ed.2d 383 (1977). A nonprofit
    association must meet the three requirements only if it seeks
    to represent the interests of its members. If the suit concerns
    only the nonprofit association's interests, subsection (b)
    (numbered as subsection (2) in C.R.S.) does not apply.</M></P>
    <P>4.
    <M>If participation of individual members is required, the
    nonprofit association does not have standing. If the injury for
    which a claim is made or the remedy sought is different for
    different members, their participation through testimony and
    presenting other evidence is required. The typical case in
    which a nonprofit association has standing is where it seeks
    only a declaration, injunction, or some form of prospective
    relief for injury to its members. Warth v. Seldin, 422 U.S.
    490, 515, 95 S. Ct. 2197, 45 L.Ed.2d 343 (1975).</M></P>
    <P>5.
    <M>Subsection (b) (numbered as subsection (2) in C.R.S.) does
    not require the nonprofit association to show that it suffered
    harm or has some interest to protect to have standing to
    represent the interests of its members. Warth v. Seldin, 422
    U.S. 490, 511 95 S. Ct. 2197, 45 L.Ed.2d 343 (1975). Some
    states require an association to have an interest to protect
    which is separate from that of its members. One court found
    that the probable loss of members if it did not take action on
    their behalf was a sufficient interest to protect to give it
    standing to represent its members. This approach certainly
    diminishes greatly the burden of satisfying the requirement.
    States have further modified the old standing rule. Recently
    many states have adopted the three-pronged federal rule, which
    is the rule in subsection (b) (numbered as subsection (1) in
    C.R.S.).</M></P>

    <P>1.
    <M>This section is consistent with Restatement (Second) of
    Judgments, Section 61(2), which provides: "If under applicable
    law an unincorporated association is treated as a jural entity
    distinct from its members, a judgment for or against the
    association has the same effects with respect to the
    association and its members as a judgment for or against a
    corporation ... ."</M></P>
    <P>2.
    <M>Section 8 (numbered as section 7-30-108 in C.R.S.) applies
    not only to judgments but also to orders, such as an award
    rendered in arbitration or an injunction.</M></P>
    <P>3.
    <M>Section 8 (numbered as section 7-30-108 in C.R.S.) reverses
    the common law rule. Under the common law's aggregate view of
    an unincorporated association, members, as co-principals, were
    individually liable for obligations of the association.</M></P>
    <P>4.
    <M>Some states changed the common law rule by statute. Ohio,
    for example, provides that the property of an unincorporated
    association is subject to judgment, execution, and other
    process and that a money judgment against the association may
    be "enforced only against the association as an entity" and not
    "against a member." Ohio Rev. Code Ann., Section 1745.02
    (Baldwin 1991).</M></P>
    <P>An obvious corollary of this section is that a judgment

  <COMMENT-TEXT>
    <P>1.
    <M>Section 9 (numbered as section 7-30-109 in C.R.S.) is not a
    dissolution rule. An inactive nonprofit association may not be
    one that has dissolved. It may have just stopped functioning
    and have taken no formal steps to dissolve. It might possibly
    be revived.</M></P>
    <P>Section 9 (numbered as section 7-30-109 in C.R.S.) gives a
    person in possession or control of personal property of a
    nonprofit association an opportunity to be relieved of
    responsibility for it. Compliance with the section provides a
    safe harbor.</P>
    <P>2.
    <M>"Inactive" is not defined. A nonprofit association that has
    accomplished its purpose, such as seeking approval in a school
    bond election, is very likely inactive. A nonprofit association
    that has stopped pursuing its purposes, collecting dues,
    holding elections of officers and board members, and conducting
    meetings, and has no employees would seem to be
    inactive.</M></P>
    <P>"Inactive" does not describe a nonprofit association whose
    sole purpose is to act should a specific problem arise. That
    there has been no activity because the problem has not arisen
    does not make the standby organization "inactive."</P>
    <P>A three year period of inactivity is suggested. It is
    unlikely that a nonprofit association that has been inactive
    for that period will begin functioning again. Thus, it is
    prudent to transfer its assets to someone likely to make
    appropriate use of them.</P>
    <P>3.
    <M>Section 9 (numbered as section 7-30-109 in C.R.S.) applies
    only to personal property -- tangible and intangible. Unclaimed
    property acts also apply to both kinds of personal property.
    All states have some form of unclaimed property act. Therefore,
    the relationship of these acts to this Act must be
    examined.</M></P>
    <P>The Uniform Unclaimed Property Act (1981) applies to certain
    intangible and tangible personal property. If the property has
    been unclaimed by the owner for five or more years it is
    presumed abandoned. Intangible property, such as checking and
    savings accounts and uncollected dividends, is the main concern
    of these Acts. The obligor, such as a bank or other financial
    institution and corporation, is directed to report and turn
    over the property to the state administrator.</P>
    <P>The only tangible personal property to which the Uniform
    Unclaimed Property Act (1981) applies is that in "a safe
    deposit box or any other safekeeping repository." Many states
    have additional statutes that apply to property abandoned in
    airport, bus, and railroad lockers and the like. Tangible
    personal property of an inactive nonprofit association in the
    control or possession of a member or other person is not likely
    to be in these places. Therefore, overlap of this Act with the
    other state acts with respect to tangible personal property is
    likely to be very limited.</P>
    <P>Property of an inactive nonprofit association is likely to
    be in the possession or control of a former member, board
    member, officer, or employee. Especially with respect to
    intangible property, their relation to the property is unlike
    that of those regulated by the unclaimed property acts. They
    are custodians or fiduciaries and not obligors. Those upon whom
    duties are imposed by the unclaimed property acts are obligors
    on such intangible property as bank accounts, money orders,
    life insurance policies, and utility deposits. The person
    acting under Section 9 (numbered as section 7-30-109 in C.R.S.)
    is very unlikely to be in the position of an obligor on such
    intangible property. In summary, there appears to be limited
    overlap.</P>
    <P>Other special statutes may apply, such as laws governing
    unexpended campaign funds. Texas, for example, permits a person
    to retain political contributions for six years after the
    person is no longer an office-holder or candidate. It gives the
    person six choices of transferees, including a "recognized tax
    exempt charitable organization formed for educational,
    religious or scientific purposes." Tex. Code Ann. Elections
    Section 251.012(d) and (e) (Vernon's 1986). Minnesota provides
    that if an unincorporated religious society "ceases to exist or
    to maintain its organization" title to its real and personal
    property vests in the "next higher governing or supervisory"
    body of the same denomination. Minn. Stat. Ann. Section 315.37
    (West 1992).</P>
    <P>4.
    <M>Section 9 (numbered as section 7-30-109 in C.R.S.) does not
    address what should be done with real property of an inactive
    nonprofit association. This seems justified. A nonprofit
    association owning real property of significant value is
    unlikely to become inactive. In the rare case that it does, the
    assistance of a court may be obtained in making appropriate
    disposition of the real property, primarily to ensure good
    title.</M></P>
    <P>5.
    <M>To obtain a Section 501(c)(3) tax classification as a
    nonprofit organization an association must specify a
    distribution of assets on dissolution that satisfies the
    Internal Revenue Code. To avoid the interpretation that Section
    9 (numbered as section 7-30-109 in C.R.S.) might be construed
    to override an approved distribution provision in an
    association's governing document the primacy of that
    distribution provision is expressly recognized in paragraph (1)
    (numbered as subsection (1)(a) in C.R.S.).</M></P>
    <P>6.
    <M>If there is no bylaw or other controlling document the
    person may transfer the personal property to another nonprofit
    organization or a government or governmental entity. The
    nonprofit organization need not have the same nonprofit purpose
    as the inactive one. It is enough that the transferee's purpose
    is "broadly similar." This requirement should not be construed
    narrowly. Otherwise, the risk of potential litigation over the
    transferor's choice will frustrate the section's purpose to
    provide a safe harbor.</M></P>
    <P>There is no limitation with respect to the choice of a
    government or governmental entity.</P>
    <P>7.
    <M>Inasmuch as the transfer is made without consideration and
    the association almost certainly rendered insolvent, creditors
    of a nonprofit association would be protected by the Uniform
    Fraudulent Transfer Act Sections 4(a) and 5 and similar
    statutes. Whether they would also be protected if the transfer
    is made to the administrator of an unclaimed property statute
    depends on the terms of a jurisdiction's act. Uniform Unclaimed
    Property Act (1981) Sections 20 and 24 contemplate that a
    creditor may proceed against property in the hands of the
    administrator if the creditor claims an interest in the
    property, such as a security interest or judgment lien.
    However, a general creditor without some claim against the
    property would not be protected. It is unlikely that an
    inactive nonprofit association would have both unpaid creditors
    and a significant amount of property. Therefore, the two issues
    discussed above are unlikely to arise.</M></P>
    <P>8.
    <M>The person in possession or control is not required to give
    notice of the proposed transfer to anyone. An examination of to
    whom notice might reasonably be given reveals the difficulty
    with such a requirement. Almost by definition an inactive
    nonprofit association has no current members.</M></P>

    <M>This section authorizes but does not require a nonprofit
    association to file a statement authorizing an agent to receive
    service of process. It is, of course, not the equivalent of
    filing articles of incorporation. However, some nonprofit
    associations may find it prudent to file. Filing may assure
    that the nonprofit association's leadership gets prompt notice
    of any lawsuit filed against it. Also, depending upon the

    <P>This provision reverses the common law rule of partnerships,
    which courts often extended to unincorporated, nonprofit

    This Act's entity approach requires this change of the old
    common law rule. Similar provisions are found in many state
    statutes. See, for example, Ohio Rev. Code Ann., Corporations,
    Section 1745.04 (Baldwin 1991); Md. Ann. Code art. 6-406(a)(2);

    <M>Venue, unlike service of process, is treated by statute. See
    for example Mont. Code Ann. Section 25-2-118(1) (1991); 28 USCA
    1391. A criterion used by all states for fixing venue is the
    county of residence of the defendant. Most states specify as
    many as eight additional grounds for venue, including the
    county in which the real estate that is the subject of the suit
    is situated and the county in which the act causing, in whole
    or in part, the personal injury or other tort occurred. None of
    these additional criteria present a special problem with
    respect to an unincorporated, nonprofit association.</M></P>

    the association is resident in any county in which a member

    <P>States have by statute modified the common law rule.
    Illinois, for example, provides that "a voluntary

    <P>2.

    <P>Section 13 (numbered as section 7-30-113 in C.R.S.) adapts
    Rule 4 of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure to this setting.

    must be addressed.</P>
    <P>By rule or statute all jurisdictions have extensive law on

    treats a nonprofit unincorporated association as a legal

  <COMMENT-TEXT>
    <P>This Act provides an unincorporated, nonprofit association
    and its members with a legal structure that conforms to the
    expectations of many of them. Therefore, the need by the
    nonprofit association for additional time to revise procedures
    and forms to conform to a significant change in the law is not
    necessary. However, this Act materially affects third parties,
    particularly creditors of nonprofit associations. Anecdotal
    evidence suggests that many creditors place little reliance on
    their rights against members in extending credit. If they have
    any reservations about the creditworthiness of a nonprofit
    association they obtain guarantees from creditworthy members or
    insist on cash. To the extent that this is true, no change in
    credit policies is needed and so no extra planning time is
    needed.</P>
    <P>Unless a jurisdiction's usual effective date rule provides
    little time for affected parties to learn of a new law, it is
    unnecessary to extend this Act's effective date.</P>

  <COMMENT-HEAD>OFFICIAL COMMENT</COMMENT-HEAD>
  <COMMENT-TEXT>
    <P>1.
    <M>Section 19 (numbered as section 7-30-118 in C.R.S.) brings
    to fruition the parties' expectations that previous law
    frustrated. Inasmuch as the common law did not consider an
    unincorporated, nonprofit association to be a legal entity, it
    could not acquire property. A gift of real or personal property
    thus failed. Reference in subsection (a) (numbered as section
    7-30-118 in C.R.S.) to the transfer as "purportedly" made
    identifies the document of transfer as one not effective under
    the law. Subsection (a) (numbered as section 7-30-118 in
    C.R.S.) gives effect to the gift. However, if parties were
    informed about the common law they may have treated the gift as
    ineffective. In that case, the final clause of subsection (a)
    (numbered as section 7-30-118 in C.R.S.) provides that the gift
    does not become effective when this Act takes effect.</M></P>
    <P>2.
    <M>Section 19 (numbered as section 7-30-118 in C.R.S.) should
    not be read as a retroactive rule. It applies to the facts
    existing when this Act takes effect. At that time subsection
    (a) (numbered as section 7-30-118 in C.R.S.) applies to a
    purported transfer of property that under the law of the
    jurisdiction could not be given effect at the time it was made.
    Subsection (a) (numbered as section 7-30-118 in C.R.S.)
    belatedly makes it effective -- effective when this Act takes
    effect and not when made. The practical result of this
    difference in when the purported transfer is effective is that
    the transfer is subject to interests in the property that came
    into being in the interim. The nonprofit association's interest
    is subject, for example, to a tax or judgment lien that became
    effective in the interim. An intervening transfer by the
    initial transferor may simply be evidence that the "parties had
    treated the transfer as ineffective." If so, subsection (a)
    (numbered as section 7-30-118 in C.R.S.) by its terms does not
    vest ownership in the nonprofit association.</M></P>
    <P>3.
    <M>Some courts gave effect to gift of property to an
    unincorporated, nonprofit association by determining that the
    gift lodged title in someone, often officers of the
    association, to hold the property in trust for the benefit of
    the association and its members. Subsection (b) (language
    removed in C.R.S.) addresses this situation. When the Act takes
    effect it authorizes the fiduciary to transfer the property to
    the association. If the fiduciary is unwilling or reluctant,
    the association may require the fiduciary to transfer the
    property to the association. In either case, the association
    will get a deed transferring the property to it which, in the
    case of real property, the association may record.</M></P>
    <P>4.
    <M>Jurisdictions may face one of three different legislative
    situations with respect to Section 19 (numbered as section
    7-30-118 in C.R.S.). First, a jurisdiction may not have changed
    the common law. In that case, Section 19 (numbered as section
    7-30-118 in C.R.S.) fits its situation well. Subsections (a)
    (numbered as section 7-30-118 in C.R.S.) and (b) (language
    removed in C.R.S.) address the two approaches taken by the
    courts under the common law. Secondly, a jurisdiction may have
    changed the common law so as to make effective transfers of
    real and personal property to some but not all nonprofit
    associations. In this case Section 19 (numbered as section
    7-30-118 in C.R.S.) should be made applicable to those
    nonprofit associations that did not have the benefit of the
    special acts. Thirdly, some jurisdictions may have extended to
    all nonprofit associations the privilege of acquiring in their
    names real and personal property. In this case, the
    jurisdiction does not need Section 19 (numbered as section
    7-30-118 in C.R.S.) and so should not adopt it.</M></P>
    <P>5.
    <M>Jurisdictions that have a statute like New York's concerning
    grants of property by will have a problem that needs special
    attention. The New York statute provides that a grant by will
    of real or personal property to an unincorporated association
    is effective only if the association incorporates within three
    years after probate of the will. McKinney's N.Y. Estates,
    Powers &amp; Trust Law Section 3-1.3 (1991). The grants by will
    that need attention are those that have not become effective by
    incorporation of the association and have not become
    ineffective by the running of the three year period. These
    grants seem entitled to the benefits of Section 19 (numbered as
    section 7-30-118 in C.R.S.). If so, some modification of
    Section 19 (numbered as section 7-30-118 in C.R.S.) may be
    required.</M></P>

    <P>1.
    <M>Section 20 (numbered as section 7-30-119 in C.R.S.) is
    adapted from RUPA Section 1006(c). It continues the prior law
    after the effective date of this Act with respect to a (i)
    "right accrued" and (ii) pending "action or proceeding." But
    for this section the new law of this Act would displace the old
    in some circumstances. The power of a new act to displace the
    old statute with respect to conduct occurring before the new
    act's enactment is substantial. Millard H. Ruud, The Savings
    Clause -- Some Problems in Construction and Drafting, 33 Tex.
    L. Rev. 285, 286-293 (1955). A court generally applies the law
    that exists at the time it acts.</M></P>
    <P>2.
    <M>Almost all states have general savings statutes, usually as
    a part of their statutory construction acts. These are often
    very broad. See, for example, Model Statutory Construction Act,
    Section 53. As this Act is remedial, the more limited savings
    provisions in Section 20 (numbered as section 7-30-119 in
    C.R.S.) are more appropriate than the broad savings provisions
    of the usual general savings clause. Section 20 (numbered as
    section 7-30-119 in C.R.S.) and not a jurisdiction's general
    savings clause applies to the Act.</M></P>
    <P>3.
    <M>"Right Accrued." It is not always clear whether an alleged
    right has "accrued." Some courts have interpreted the phrase to
    mean that a "matured cause of action or legal authority to
    demand redress" exists.</M>
    <B>Estate of Hoover v. Iowa Dept. of Social Services</B>, 299
    Iowa 702, 251 N.W. 2d 529 (1977). In 
    <B>Nielsen v. State of Wisconsin</B>, 258 Wis. 1110, 141 N.W.
    2d 194 (1966), a landowner brought suit after the repeal of an
    act granting a landowner the right to recover from the state
    for damages to her land caused by the state's failure to
    install necessary culverts and the like to prevent flooding.
    Before the act's repeal the landowner's land had been damaged
    by flooding caused by the state's failures. The court held that
    the statutory saving of "rights of action accrued" saved her
    cause of action. In both of these cases, conduct that gave rise
    to a cause of action had occurred before the act was repealed.
    It is said that it is not enough that there is an inchoate
    right. Apparently, there is no "accrued right" under a
    contract, for example, until there is a breach.</P>
    <P>4.
    <M>"Action or Proceeding" Pending. The principal question is
    what is an "action or proceeding" for this purpose. "Action"
    refers to a judicial proceeding. "Proceeding" alone, especially
    when used with "action," is broader and so includes
    administrative and other governmental proceedings. It has been
    given the broader meaning. For example, in</M>
    <B>State ex rel. Carmean v. Board of Education of Hardin
    County</B>, 170 Ohio 2d 415, 165 N.E. 2d 918 (1960) a petition
    to transfer certain land from one school district to another
    filed before a change in the law was a "pending proceeding" to
    be decided under the old law. Similarly, a request for
    permission to petition for an election to consolidate school
    districts was held to be a "proceeding commenced" so that the
    substance and procedure of the old law, which was materially
    different from the new, was preserved. 
    <B>Grant v. Norris</B>, 249 Iowa 236, 85 N.W. 2d 261
    (1957).</P>
    <P>5.
    <M>RUPA provides that the Act does not "impair obligations of
    contract existing." This is not carried forward. This phrase is
    intended to save only obligations protected by the contracts
    clauses of state and federal constitutions. However, as it
    might be construed more broadly and the constitution would
    protect without the phrase, the phrase is not present in
    Section 20 (numbered as section 7-30-119 in C.R.S.).</M></P>

  <N></N>(a)
  <M>Any three or more persons, who may or may not be residents of
  the state of Colorado, may associate themselves together to
  establish a corporation not for profit for any lawful business or
  to promote any legitimate object or purpose and may make, sign,
  and acknowledge and file in the office of the secretary of state
  of the state of Colorado and record in the office of the recorder
  of each county in which said corporation owns real estate in the
  state of Colorado a certificate in writing, setting forth the
  name of such corporation, the business, objects, or purposes for
  which it is formed, and the names of the first directors,
  trustees, or managers. The department of revenue shall collect a
  fee of five dollars for filing said certificate.</M>
  <P N="(1)(b)">(b)
  <M>Notwithstanding the amount specified for the fee in paragraph
  (a) of this subsection (1), the executive director of the
  department of revenue by rule or as otherwise provided by law may
  reduce the amount of the fee if necessary pursuant to section
  24-75-402 (3), C.R.S., to reduce the uncommitted reserves of the
  fund to which all or any portion of the fee is credited. After
  the uncommitted reserves of the fund are sufficiently reduced,
  the executive director by rule or as otherwise provided by law
  may increase the amount of the fee as provided in section
  24-75-402 (4), C.R.S.</M></P>
  <P N="(2)">(2)
  <M>The provisions of this article shall not apply to any
  nonprofit corporation formed after December 31, 1967, nor shall
  they apply to any corporation not for profit formed prior to
  January 1, 1968, which is subject to the provisions of articles
  121 to 137 of this title.</M></P></SECTION-TEXT>

    <B>Distinguishing rights of corporation and

    hold title to the water rights and other property, and to
    manage the affairs of the corporation, should be distinguished
    from the right of the shareholders to use the water on their
    lands. Jacobucci v. District Court, 189 Colo. 380, 541 P.2d 667
    (1975).

    <B>Appropriation of water to an actual beneficial use, and not

    667 (1975).</P>
    <P>
    <B>Pro rata water rights.</B>The benefit derived from the
    ownership of stock in a mutual ditch corporation is the right
    to the exclusive use of the water it represents, the water
    being divided pro rata according to the number of shares of
    stock held by each shareholder. Jacobucci v. District Court,

    <B>Liability and obligation.</B>The mutual ditch corporation is

    each of its shareholders, but it is liable in damages for the
    failure to do so. Jacobucci v. District Court, 189 Colo. 380,
    541 P.2d 667 (1975); Nelson v. Lake Canal Co., 644 P.2d 55

    <P>
    <B>Proceedings under this section to compel delivery of water
    must necessarily be somewhat summary</B>in their nature, for to
    be effective the relief must be immediate; and to this end
    trial courts should be liberal in matters of pleading and
    practice lest, for example, the crops of a farmer burn while
    counsel contend over legal technicalities. Townsend v. Fulton
    Irrigating Ditch Co., 17 Colo. 142, 29 P. 453 (1891).</P>
    <P>
    <B>Corporation is not the only proper representative of
    shareholders' interests.</B>Inasmuch as the right to "use
    water" vests solely in the shareholders, and the mutual ditch
    corporation neither administers nor participates in this actual
    use, the corporation cannot be deemed the trustee and only
    proper representative of the shareholders' interests in this
    matter. Jacobucci v. District Court, 189 Colo. 380, 541 P.2d
    667 (1975).</P>

    <P>
    <B>A carrier is entitled to compensation for carriage,</B>but
    it cannot charge for the right to use water from its canal, nor
    can it exact in advance a part or all of its transportation
    charge for the remaining years of its corporate life as a
    condition precedent to use for the current irrigating season.
    Wheeler v. Northern Colo. Irrigation Co., 10 Colo. 582, 17 P.
    487 (1887).</P>
    <P>
    <B>Moreover, a carrier does not have the rate-making
    power,</B>and if the carrier assumes and exercises such power,
    its acts would be subject to a review and change by the county
    commissioners upon a proper showing. Montezuma Water &amp; Land
    Co. v. McCracken, 62 Colo. 394, 163 P. 286 (1917); Northern
    Colo. Irrigation Co. v. Bd. of Comm'rs, 95 Colo. 555, 38 P.2d
    889 (1934).</P>
    <P>
    <B>There mere failure of the owner of a water right to go to
    the irrigation company each season and pay</B>the stipulated
    price for carrying his water does not entitle any other person
    to enter into a contract with the company for carrying such
    water and to thereby become the owner of the water right.
    Cooper v. Shannon, 36 Colo. 98, 85 P. 175 (1906).</P>
    <P>
    <B>However, this section does not apply to a proceeding between
    individuals in which no ditch company is a party,</B>as where
    the question to be determined is whether a sheriff's deed
    includes a water right. Cooper v. Shannon, 36 Colo. 98, 85 P.

    <B>Commissioners prescribe rates.</B>This section provides that
    the county commissioners, when an irrigating ditch is completed
    and prepared to furnish water, are to prescribe the rates at
    which water shall be furnished. Northern Colo. Irrigation Co.
    v. Bd. of Comm'rs, 95 Colo. 555, 38 P.2d 889 (1934). 
    <P>
    <B>But if a carrier has a rate of its own with which the
    consumer is satisfied,</B>he is not required to apply to the
    commissioners to fix a maximum rate. Wheeler v. Northern Colo.
    Irrigation Co., 10 Colo. 582, 17 P. 487 (1887).</P>
    <P>
    <B>The rates fixed by the board of county commissioners are
    subject to judicial control.</B>Wheeler v. Northern Colo.
    Irrigation Co., 10 Colo. 582, 17 P. 487 (1887); Montezuma Water
    &amp; Land Co. v. McCracken, 62 Colo. 394, 163 P. 286
    (1917).</P>
    <P>
    <B>And where a rate of charge fixed by the board has been
    judicially declared unreasonable</B>and confiscatory, the board
    will not be permitted to evade the effect of such judgment by
    declaring and establishing the same rate of charge upon the
    same evidence. Montezuma Water &amp; Land Co. v. McCracken, 62
    Colo. 394, 163 P. 286 (1917).</P>
    <P>
    <B>However, a new reasonable maximum rate may be set.</B>Where
    a rate prescribed by the board has been adjudged unreasonable
    and its enforcement enjoined, it is no violation of an
    injunction for the board to immediately prescribe a reasonable
    maximum rate. Montezuma Water &amp; Land Co. v. McCracken, 62

  the votes cast is in favor of a renewal of the corporation, the
  president and secretary of the company, under the corporate seal
  of the company, shall certify the fact, and shall make as many
  certificates as may be necessary. The company shall record one
  certificate in the office of the recorder of deeds in each county
  in which the company does business and shall deliver to the
  secretary of state for filing pursuant to part 3 of article 90 of
  this title a statement of extension of term that states that the
  term of the company has been extended, the principal office
  address of the company, and the registered agent name and
  registered agent address of the company. The corporate life of
  the company shall be renewed upon such recording and filing of
  the declaration, and all stockholders shall have the same rights

  <M>Where any water users' association formed under the law of
  this state has entered into or proposes to enter into a contract
  with the United States for the payment by the association of the
  construction and other charges of a federal reclamation project
  constructed or under construction within this state, and where
  the funds for the payment of such charges are to be obtained by
  the association from assessments levied upon the stock of such
  association and constituting liens upon the lands of such
  stockholders, the association, in any case where the said
  contract or proposed contract would modify or affect any
  individual contracts between the United States and such
  stockholders or between the association and such stockholders,
  may file in the district court of the county in which the office
  of such water users' association is situated, a petition entitled
  "........ water users' association against the stockholders of
  said association and the owners and mortgagees of land within the
  ........ federal reclamation project". No other or more specific
  description of the defendants shall be required.</M>
  <P N="(2)">(2)
  <M>In the petition it may be stated that the association has
  entered into or proposes to enter into a contract with the United
  States, to be set out in full in said petition, with a prayer
  that the court find the contract to be valid, and a modification
  of any individual contracts between the United States and the

  the clerk of the court stating in brief outline the contents of
  said petition and showing where a full copy of the contract or
  proposed contract may be examined, such notice to be directed to
  the said defendants under the same general designations, which
  shall be deemed sufficient to give the court jurisdiction of all
  matters involved and parties interested.</M></P>
  <P N="(3)">(3)
  <M>Service shall be obtained by publication of this notice as in
  the case of publication of summons in an action to quiet title to

  twenty days or such further time as may be allowed therefor by
  the court. The failure of any person affected by the said

  said individual contracts with the association or with the United

  the said individual contracts to conform to the terms of the

    <P>
    <B>Right to locate road.</B>The effect of this section, and the
    section giving right of condemnation for construction of roads,
    is to give a road company the right to locate its road on the
    general course designated in its articles of incorporation, and
    when so located, to construct, maintain, and operate the road
    on the line of location, subject to the conditions of
    condemnation, compensation, and other requirements of the

    <P>
    <B>But toll road cannot be located on any existing
    road.</B>Under this section it is clear that a toll road
    company may not locate its road, or any part thereof, upon any
    toll road previously existing or upon any public highway
    heretofore and as the time of the organization of such company
    used and traveled as such, except as it might be necessary to

    which at the time had been abandoned by the former toll road
    company for a period of more than 14 months and which had been
    repaired and traveled by persons living in the vicinity, the
    location was in violation of this section and the company
    thereby forfeited its franchise and right to collect tolls.

    <B>Moreover, as long as the power to locate a road remains

    may ultimately cast the easement are uncertain, and no given
    tract or parcel of land can be designated as charged with the
    easement. Riddell v. Animas Canon Toll Rd. Co., 5 Colo. 230

    <P>
    <B>Only one toll gate each 10 miles.</B>Under this section the
    board of county commissioners is powerless to authorize the
    erection of and taking of toll at more than "one gate to each
    ten miles". Central Rd. Co. v. People, 5, Colo. 39 (1879).</P>
    <P>
    <B>Hence, wherever there are 2 gates or more, the distance
    between them must be</B>not less than 10 miles. Central Rd. Co.
    v. People, 5 Colo. 39 (1879).</P>
    <P>
    <B>A toll road company may alienate all its tangible property

    limitations or burdens existed against it will still exist
    against its grantee. Virginia Canon Toll Rd. Co. v. People ex

    <P>
    <B>But not the power to continue the franchise after it
    expires.</B>A toll road company cannot by conveyance made
    during its corporate life impart to another corporation or to a
    natural person the power to continue the exercise of a
    franchise to collect tolls after the franchise itself has
    expired by operation of law. Virginia Canon Toll Rd. Co. v.

  7-45-101 (1) and a new toll road or toll highway company shall
  not have the power to exercise the right of eminent domain to
  acquire any part of the right-of-way of a toll road or toll
  highway it proposes to construct. Nothing herein shall prohibit a
  preexisting or new toll road or toll highway company from
  entering into a public-private initiative with the department of
  transportation in accordance with the provisions of part 12 of
  article 1 of title 43, C.R.S., and as authorized in section
  7-45-111 for the purpose of enabling the construction of a toll
  road or toll highway, but in such a case the power of eminent
  domain shall not be exercised by the toll road or toll highway
  company and may be exercised by the department only for purposes
  of acquiring property and rights-of-way necessary for the
  completion of a toll road or toll highway open to the public that
  is incorporated into the comprehensive statewide transportation
  plan prepared pursuant to section 43-1-1103 (5), C.R.S. The
  department may not use the power of eminent domain provided in
  this section to acquire a cemetery, as defined in section
  10-15-102 (2), C.R.S., or property owned by or primarily used by
  a religious organization. In exercising the power of eminent
  domain, the department shall comply with all laws and
  administrative rules that govern the department's use of eminent
  domain for state highway projects, and the rights-of-way acquired
  shall form a corridor no larger than that approved by all
  affected metropolitan planning organizations, regional planning
  commissions, and the transportation commission pursuant to
  sections 7-45-105 and 7-45-106. In accordance with section
  43-1-1204 (3)(b), C.R.S., the department may not sell or

  acquired through the exercise of the power of eminent domain as
  authorized by this section to a toll road or toll highway
  company.</M>

  <M>The general assembly hereby finds and declares that:</M>
  <P N="(1)(a)">(a)
  <M>There exists in both the urban and rural areas of the state a
  substantial quantity of older houses which, while still
  structurally sound and safe, are in danger of deteriorating due
  to the lack of available private investment capital which would
  help ensure their purchase or rehabilitation;</M></P>
  <P N="(1)(b)">(b)
  <M>The purchase, repair, and restoration of such houses by
  interested persons will tend to stabilize the physical and social
  environment of the area in which such houses are located,
  preserve the economic base of the community of which they are a
  part, and help prevent the spread of blighted houses;</M></P>
  <P N="(1)(c)">(c)
  <M>A need exists for assistance to individuals and families in
  securing financing to purchase or rehabilitate such housing; that
  such purpose can best be met by coordination and cooperation
  among private lenders and insurers with state and local
  governments; that such assistance can be provided by stimulating
  the flow of private investment capital into the financing of such
  houses by providing a program of mortgage lending and insurance
  specifically designed to provide loans or insurance to
  individuals or families who would otherwise qualify for mortgage
  loans in areas of newer housing; and that local governments can
  further stimulate the upgrading of endangered older houses by
  minimizing the problems associated with over-restrictive and
  narrowly-defined and administered building codes and inspection
  procedures.</M></P>

    <B>Trustees, wardens, vestrymen, or other officers are the
    managing officers and trustees of a religious corporation</B>in
    the same sense that the directors and officers of a bank or a
    railroad company are officers and trustees of such corporation,
    and thus they are invested, in regard to the temporal affairs
    of the church or society, with the powers conferred by the
    statute and with the ordinary discretionary powers of similar
    corporate officers. Horst v. Traudt, 43 Colo. 445, 96 P. 259

    <P>
    <B>And the members are similar to stockholders.</B>In

  <M>The general assembly finds and declares that:</M>
  <P N="(1)(a)">(a)
  <M>The cooperative form of doing business provides an efficient
  and effective method for persons to market their goods and
  services and to obtain services and supplies and it is in the
  best interests of the people of the state of Colorado to promote,
  foster, and encourage the utilization of cooperatives in
  appropriate instances;</M></P>
  <P N="(1)(b)">(b)
  <M>The cooperative marketing law of the state of Colorado has
  provided for the promotion, fostering, and encouragement of the
  intelligent and orderly marketing of agricultural products
  through cooperation; has eliminated speculation and waste; has
  made distribution of agricultural products between producer and
  consumer more efficient; has stabilized the marketing of
  agricultural products; and has provided for the organization and
  incorporation of cooperative marketing associations for the
  marketing of such products, all as contemplated at the time of
  the original adoption of the cooperative marketing law;</M></P>
  <P N="(1)(c)">(c)
  <M>It is in the best interests of the people of the state of
  Colorado to preserve the provisions of the cooperative marketing
  law as it has been in force and interpreted in the state and to
  continue the provisions thereof for agriculture, but also to
  expand the provisions of the law to provide greater direction and
  flexibility in its provisions and to enable all types of
  industries and enterprises to avail themselves of the benefits of
  the cooperative form of doing business in accordance with the
  provisions of this article;</M></P>
  <P N="(1)(d)">(d)
  <M>It is in the best interests of the people of the state of
  Colorado to allow those cooperatives that have been formed under
  or are subject to other articles of this title, such as article
  55, to remain under said article or to elect to come under this
  article.</M></P></SECTION-TEXT>

    <B>Annotator's note.</B>The following annotations include cases
    decided under former provisions similar to this section. 
    <P>
    <B>The basic conception of a cooperative marketing
    association</B>is that of a group of farmers who reside in the
    same vicinity acting together for their mutual benefit in the
    cultivating, harvesting, and marketing of their agricultural
    products, the association itself being merely a convenient
    instrumentality in the hands of the farmers for carrying on
    such activities. Indus. Comm'n v. United Fruit Growers Ass'n,
    106 Colo. 223, 103 P.2d 15 (1940).</P>
    <P>
    <B>A cooperative marketing association is not required to pay
    contributions on the wages of individuals</B>employed by it,
    under the provisions of title 8, since the labor involved in
    the activities of the association is "agricultural labor" and
    exempt from the operation of the federal unemployment tax act
    by § 8-70-103. Indus. Comm'n v. United Fruit Growers Ass'n, 106
    Colo. 223, 103 P.2d 15 (1940).</P>
    <P>
    <B>But a different result might attain</B>where farm crops are
    marketed by a commercial profit corporation or are not marketed
    in an unmanufactured state. Indus. Comm'n v. United Fruit
    Growers Ass'n, 106 Colo. 223, 103 P.2d 15 (1940).</P>
    <P>
    <B>Legislative declaration does not provide association members
    with an express right to purchase goods and services from an
    association store.</B>Therefore, this section does not support
    a breach of contract claim. Arnold v. Anton Coop. Ass'n, 293
    P.3d 99 (Colo. App. 2011).</P></ANNO-TEXT>

    this section is void. Colo. Wheat Growers' Ass'n v. Thede, 80

  <M>Subject to the provisions of this section and under the terms
  and conditions prescribed in the articles or bylaws adopted by
  it, a cooperative may limit admission as members or issue common
  stock only to persons engaged in the particular business or
  utilizing the goods or services provided by or through the
  cooperative, including any entity formed under the law of this
  state or any other jurisdiction, or may admit as members or issue
  common stock to any person meeting uniform terms and conditions
  stated in its articles or bylaws.</M>
  <P N="(2)">(2)
  <M>When any required membership fee or payment for stock as
  required in the articles, the bylaws, or a resolution of the
  board has been paid in full or a promissory note executed for the
  required membership fee or capital subscription, a cooperative
  may issue a certificate of membership or common stock evidencing
  the membership or ownership of the stock or may evidence the same
  on the books or other records of the cooperative as determined by
  the articles, the bylaws, or the board. Except for a cooperative
  formed with stock, promissory notes of members may not be
  accepted by the cooperative as full or partial payment for stock
  unless permitted by the bylaws and adequately secured. The
  cooperative shall hold the stock as security for the payment of
  the note, but such retention as security shall not affect the
  member's right to vote.</M></P>
  <P N="(3)">(3)
  <M>No member shall have a right to vote until the required
  membership fee or payment for stock has been paid in
  full.</M></P>
  <P N="(4)">(4)
  <M>A cooperative, in its articles or bylaws, may limit the amount
  of common stock that a member may own.</M></P>
  <P N="(5)">(5)
  <M>No member shall be liable directly or indirectly, including by
  way of indemnification, contribution, or otherwise, under a
  judgment, decree, or order of a court, or in any other manner,
  for a debt, obligation, or liability of or chargeable to the
  cooperative while it is incorporated for an amount exceeding the
  sum remaining unpaid on the member's membership fee or the
  member's subscription to the stock, including any unpaid balance
  on any promissory note given in payment thereof; except that this
  subsection (5) shall not affect the liability of a member who is
  also a member of the board or an officer for such member's
  negligence, wrongful act, or misconduct in that capacity.</M></P>
  <P N="(6)">(6)
  <M>A cooperative formed with or without capital stock under this
  article may issue or accept investments in nonvoting stock or
  equity that may have such rights and preferences, including being
  subject to per unit retains or allocations of net margins, as may
  be provided in the articles, the bylaws, or by the board. Such
  nonvoting stock or equity may be issued and sold by the
  cooperative to any person, including those persons not otherwise
  qualified to be members, and may be redeemable or retireable by
  the cooperative on such terms and conditions as are provided for
  in the articles, the bylaws, or a resolution of the board
  providing for the issuance of or the investment in the nonvoting
  stock or equity. The terms and conditions of redemption shall be
  printed on any certificate evidencing the stock or
  equity.</M></P>
  <P N="(7)">(7)
  <M>A cooperative shall impose restrictions on the transfer of
  voting common stock or membership in the cooperative in its
  bylaws in accordance with section 7-56-208 (2), and may also
  impose such restrictions in its articles, and may impose
  restrictions on the transfer of other equity investments in the
  cooperative in its articles, bylaws, or by resolution of its
  board. Any such restriction shall be printed upon any certificate
  or other written evidence of the membership, voting common stock,
  or other equity investment if one is issued.</M></P>
  <P N="(8)">(8)
  <M>Subject to the provisions of section 7-56-406 (2)(c), a
  cooperative may, at any time as stated in its articles, bylaws,
  or resolution of the board adopted at the time of issuance,
  acquire, recall, redeem, exchange, or reissue its common stock,
  memberships, preferred stock, preferred equity, memberships, or
  other equity capital. Consideration paid for stock, memberships,
  or other equity capital acquired, recalled, redeemed, exchanged,
  or reissued by the cooperative shall be the par value, stated
  value, price originally paid, or book value, whichever is less,
  as conclusively determined by the board, plus any accrued and
  unpaid dividends, if any, and, if the price originally paid for
  the stock, memberships, or other equity capital included an
  additional amount based upon the right of the holder to engage in
  business with the cooperative, the consideration shall include
  the additional amount. If stock, memberships, or other equity
  capital acquired, recalled, redeemed, or exchanged does not have
  a par value, then the par value shall not be considered in
  determining the consideration. The cooperative may set off
  against the consideration to be paid obligations to it of the
  holder of stock, membership, or other equity capital and shall
  have a continuing perfected security interest in the stock,
  membership, and other equity capital of a member, stockholder, or
  holder of other equity capital to secure payment of any
  indebtedness to the cooperative of the stockholder, member, or
  holder of other equity capital, whenever indebtedness is
  incurred. Notwithstanding any other provision of law, the
  security interest shall take priority over all other perfected
  security interests. No acquisition, recall, or redemption shall
  be made if the result of it would be to bring the value of the
  remaining assets of the cooperative below the aggregate of its
  indebtedness. The articles or bylaws may provide other
  limitations on the right of a cooperative to acquire, recall,
  redeem, exchange, or reissue its stock, memberships, or other
  equity capital.</M></P>

  <M>If a member of a cooperative is other than an individual, such

  <M>The affairs of a cooperative formed under or subject to this
  article shall be managed by a board of not less than three
  directors as provided in the articles or bylaws elected by and
  from the members of the cooperative or designated representatives
  of members who are not individuals. If authorized by the articles
  or the bylaws, up to twenty percent of the board may consist of
  directors who are neither members nor representatives of members.
  Directors who are not members of the cooperative or
  representatives of members may be elected by a vote of two-thirds
  of the cooperative members present and voting. Nominations for
  the position of director shall be conducted in a manner provided
  in the bylaws or in a resolution of the board or of the
  members.</M>
  <P N="(2)">(2)
  <M>The articles or bylaws may provide that the territory in which
  the cooperative has members shall be divided into districts and
  that the directors shall be elected according to such districts,
  either directly or by district delegates elected by the members
  in that district. In that case the articles or bylaws shall state
  the number of directors to be elected by each district and the
  manner and method of reapportioning the directors and of
  redistricting the territory covered by the cooperative. The
  bylaws may provide that primary elections shall be held in each
  district to elect the directors apportioned to such districts and
  that the result of all such primary elections shall be ratified
  at the next regular meeting of the cooperative or be considered
  final as to the cooperative.</M></P>
  <P N="(3)">(3)
  <M>A cooperative may provide a reasonable remuneration for the
  time actually spent by its officers and directors in its service.
  No director, during the term of the director's office, shall be a
  party to a contract for profit with the cooperative differing in
  any way from the business relations accorded members of the
  cooperative.</M></P>
  <P N="(4)">(4)
  <M>The articles or bylaws may limit directors from occupying any
  position in the cooperative on a regular salary or substantially
  full-time pay. The articles or bylaws may provide for an
  executive committee and may allot to the committee all the
  functions and powers of the board, subject to the general
  direction and control of the board.</M></P>
  <P N="(5)">(5)
  <M>When a vacancy on the board occurs other than by expiration of
  term, the remaining members of the board, even though not a
  quorum, by a majority vote, shall fill the unexpired term, unless
  the articles or bylaws provide for an election of directors by
  district, in which event, unless the articles or bylaws provide
  for a different procedure, the board shall immediately call a
  special meeting of the members in the district to fill the
  vacancy.</M></P></SECTION-TEXT>

  manner required by this section.</M></P>
  <P N="(1)(b)">(b)
  <M>"Interest" means interest required to be paid pursuant to this

  at the legal rate specified in section 5-12-101, C.R.S.</M></P>
  <P N="(1)(c)">(c)
  <M>"Stated value" means the original cost paid by a person for
  capital stock or membership fees, as recorded in the records of
  the cooperative, in order to qualify for membership and the right
  to vote in the cooperative, and for other equity capital the
  amount stated in the records of the cooperative that is required
  to make a payment under this section.</M></P>
  <P N="(2)">(2)
  <M>If the board of a cooperative subject to this article submits
  to the members of the cooperative for approval a plan of merger,
  conversion, consolidation, or share or equity capital exchange
  and if following the merger, conversion, consolidation, or share
  or equity capital exchange there will be members of any
  cooperative involved in the proposed transaction who would no
  longer be eligible for membership or other voting interest in the
  surviving or resulting entity, the ineligible members shall be
  entitled to repayment of their equity interests in the
  cooperative in accordance with this section.</M></P>
  <P N="(3)">(3)
  <M>If the board of a cooperative subject to this article submits
  to the members of the cooperative for approval a plan to sell all
  or substantially all of the cooperative's assets and not dissolve
  following the sale, the members of the cooperative shall be
  entitled to repayment of their equity interests in the

  <P N="(4)">(4)
  <M>A cooperative that proposes to be a party to a merger,

  section, shall include in the notice of the membership meeting at
  which the vote of the members is taken thereon an explanation of
  the right to dissent and the requirement to give written notice
  of intent to demand payment by a member having the right to do so
  under this section.</M></P>
  <P N="(5)">(5)
  <M>A member who may be entitled to repayment of the member's

  section shall give written notice of the member's intention to
  demand payment before the vote is taken at the membership meeting
  at which a vote on the proposed merger, conversion,
  consolidation, share or equity capital exchange, or sale of
  assets is to be taken. Upon giving notice, the member shall no
  longer be entitled to vote on the proposed transaction. The
  written notice shall include the name of the member in which the
  stock or membership is held on the records of the cooperative and
  the member's address and social security or federal tax
  identification number. Failure to give written notice of
  intention to demand payment in the prescribed manner disqualifies
  the member from demanding payment under this section.</M></P>

  case of a sale of assets subject to this section, to the
  cooperative selling its assets, stating the address to which
  payment is to be made and, where applicable, a statement as to
  the reasons why the dissenter no longer qualifies for membership
  or a voting interest in the surviving, resulting, or new

  equity holder had withdrawn or been terminated from the
  cooperative that is not the surviving, resulting, or new entity
  immediately prior to the effective date of the merger,
  conversion, consolidation, or share or equity capital exchange.

  <M>Certain assignments of assets in
  dissolution.</M></CATCH-LINE>In the winding up of the affairs of
  a cooperative when certain assets are not liquid and secured
  creditors having claim on these assets have been satisfied, the
  trustees in liquidation or other persons charged with winding up
  the cooperative's affairs are authorized to make assignment of
  such assets to the unsecured creditors in settlement of their
  claims. If assignment is refused in writing, and in the judgment
  of the trustees there is no liquidity or market value and the
  costs involved in delaying the winding up of the affairs of the
  cooperative exceed the potential benefits, the trustees are
  authorized to assign the assets or future proceeds to any local
  or statewide nonprofit organization that has as one of its
  principal purposes education or community service. The trustees
  shall under no circumstances be liable to any member or equity
  holder in the cooperative for any claim on any assets assigned by
  the trustees pursuant to the authority of this
  section.</SECTION-TEXT>

  <M>Nature of limited cooperative association.</M></CATCH-LINE>(1)
  <M>A limited cooperative association organized under this article
  is an autonomous, unincorporated association of persons united to

  permits combining:</M>

  <M>On application by a judgment creditor of a member or

  to satisfy the judgment, any distribution that would otherwise be

    <B>A partnership is formed when</B>an agreement is entered into
    which clearly embodies every element necessary for the
    formation and creation of a partnership and when it is executed
    by the parties nothing further remains to be done to legally
    bring about a partnership relation. Roberts v. Roberts, 113
    Colo. 128, 155 P.2d 155 (1945); Thompson v. McCormick, 149
    Colo. 465, 370 P.2d 442 (1962).</P>
    <P>An express agreement is not required to create a
    partnership; a partnership may be formed by the conduct of the
    parties. Stratman v. Dietrich, 765 P.2d 603 (Colo. App. 1988);
    In re Winden, 120 B.R. 570 (Bankr. D. Colo. 1990).</P>
    <P>
    <B>And the partnership relation continues until it is
    dissolved</B>either by mutual agreement or by action of the
    parties or decree of court. Thompson v. McCormick, 149 Colo.
    465, 370 P.2d 442 (1962).</P>
    <P>
    <B>Failure by a partner to contribute his share of
    capital</B>does not necessarily negative existence of a
    partnership, as such failure may be waived by the other partner
    where, following execution of the agreement, the other partner
    authorizes and makes payments of profits to the noncontributing
    partner. Thompson v. McCormick, 149 Colo. 465, 370 P.2d 442
    (1962).</P>
    <P>
    <B>An agreement providing "all profits and losses in this
    venture are to be borne equally</B>by the parties", expresses a
    consideration in the form of mutual promises and is sufficient
    to bring about a partnership. Thompson v. McCormick, 149 Colo.
    465, 370 P.2d 442 (1962).</P>
    <P>
    <B>And partner's liability for losses indicates right to
    profit.</B>If a partnership incurs losses and there is no
    question but that a partner would be liable for his share of
    the losses under the terms of the partnership agreement, this
    clearly indicates that the parties intended that partner to
    have an equal share of the profits. Thompson v. McCormick, 149
    Colo. 465, 370 P.2d 442 (1962).</P>

    his rights to profits, but the remaining partners have not

    that the assignee does not become a partner without the consent
    of the remaining partners in contravention of § 7-60-118
    (1)(g). Hence, the provision that the partnership is not
    dissolved merely protects the original parties from an unwanted
    partner or from a finding of partnership from the fact of the
    assignee's receipt of a share of the profits. Wester &amp; Co.

    complete authority with respect to acts which are apparently
    within the usual course of the partnership's particular
    business, unless the other party knows that he has no such

    <B>Each active partner a general agent.</B>When acting in

    <P>
    <B>This agency principle is subject to the terms of the

    or in the name of one or more but not all of the
    partners;</B>therefore, a written conveyance from a partner who
    contributes real estate to a partnership, although a factor to
    consider, is not required to convert the property into
    partnership property. Courts must look to the parties'
    intention to determine whether the property is a partnership
    asset, including consideration of: (1) The language of any
    partnership agreement; (2) the use of the property in the
    partnership business; (3) the listing of the property as an
    asset or liability in the partnership books and tax returns;
    (4) the construction of improvements on the property at

  <M>Liability of purported partner.</M></CATCH-LINE>(1)
  <M>If a person, by words or conduct, purports to be a partner or
  consents to being represented by another as a partner, in a
  partnership or with one or more persons not partners, the
  purported partner is liable to a person to whom the
  representation is made, if that person, relying on the
  representation, enters into a transaction with the actual or
  purported partnership. If the representation, either by the
  purported partner or by a person with the purported partner's
  consent, is made in a public manner, the purported partner is
  liable to a person who relies upon the purported partnership even
  if the purported partner is not aware of being held out as a
  partner to the claimant. If a partnership obligation results, the
  purported partner is liable with respect to that obligation as if
  the purported partner were a partner in the partnership, and, if
  the partnership is a limited liability partnership, the purported
  partner's liability is subject to section 7-60-115 (2) as if the
  purported partner were a partner in the limited liability
  partnership. If no partnership obligation results, the purported
  partner is liable with respect to that liability jointly and
  severally with any other person consenting to the
  representation.</M>
  <P N="(2)">(2)
  <M>When a partnership liability results, such person is liable as
  though the person were an actual member of the partnership;
  except that, in the case of a limited liability partnership, the
  person's liability is subject to section 7-60-115 (2).</M></P>
  <P N="(3)">(3)
  <M>When no partnership liability results, such person is liable
  jointly with the other persons, if any, so consenting to the
  contract or representation as to incur liability, otherwise
  separately.</M></P>
  <P N="(4)">(4)
  <M>When a person has been thus represented to be a partner in an
  existing partnership or with one or more persons not actual
  partners, the purported partner is an agent of the persons
  consenting to such representation to bind them to the same extent
  and in the same manner as though the purported partner were a
  partner in fact with respect to persons who rely upon the
  representation. Where all the members of the existing partnership
  consent to the representation, a partnership act or obligation
  results; but in all other cases it is the joint act or obligation
  of the person acting and the persons consenting to the
  representation.</M></P></SECTION-TEXT>

    <B>A partnership is not dissolved</B>by the failure on the part

      <B>Limited partnership dissolves without general partner.</B>
      <M>Since a limited partnership cannot exist without a general

    limited partnership existed. Therefore, the general partners

  <M>A limited liability partnership or limited liability limited
  partnership shall not make a distribution to a general partner to
  the extent that, at the time of the distribution, after giving
  effect to the distribution, all liabilities of the limited
  liability partnership or limited liability limited partnership,
  other than liabilities to general partners on account of their
  partnership interests and liabilities for which the recourse of
  creditors is limited to specified property of the partnership,
  exceed the fair value of the assets of the partnership; except
  that the fair value of property that is subject to a liability
  for which the recourse of creditors is limited shall be included
  in the assets of the partnership only to the extent that the fair
  value of that property exceeds that liability. For purposes of
  this section and sections 7-62-607 and 7-62-608, the term
  "distribution" shall not include payments to the extent that the
  payments do not exceed amounts equal to or constituting
  reasonable compensation for present or past services or
  reasonable payments made in the ordinary course of business
  pursuant to a bona fide retirement plan or other benefits
  program.</M>
  <P N="(2)">(2)

  limited liability limited partnership who receives a distribution
  in violation of subsection (1) of this section, and who knew at
  the time of the distribution that such distribution violated
  subsection (1) of this section, shall be liable to the
  partnership for the amount of the distribution. A general partner
  in a limited liability partnership or limited liability limited
  partnership who receives a distribution in violation of
  subsection (1) of this section, and who did not know at the time
  of the distribution that the distribution violated subsection (1)
  of this section, shall not be liable for the amount of the
  distribution. Subject to subsection (3) of this section, this
  subsection (2) shall not affect any obligation or liability of a
  general partner under an agreement or other applicable law for
  the amount of a distribution.</M></P>
  <P N="(3)">(3)
  <M>Unless otherwise agreed, a partner in a limited liability
  partnership or limited liability limited partnership who receives
  a distribution from the partnership shall have no liability under
  this article or other applicable law for the amount of the
  distribution after the expiration of three years after the date
  of the distribution unless an action to recover the distribution
  from such partner is commenced prior to the expiration of the
  said three-year period and an adjudication of liability against
  such partner is made in the said action.</M></P></SECTION-TEXT>

    construing a prior provision has been included with the

    <P>
    <B>The purpose of this section</B>is to prevent parties putting
    in property of uncertain and estimated value and calling it

    entitle them. Holliday v. Union Bag Co., 3 Colo. 342

    <B>However, this section does not require that capital should
    be paid in cash.</B>Holliday v. Union Bag Co., 3 Colo. 342
    (1877).</P>
    <P>
    <B>Rather, this section intends that when capital is paid in
    property</B>it should be so stated, and its cash value given,
    for one of the essential precautions of the law is, that public
    notice must be given of the amount paid in so that the public
    may be enabled to estimate correctly the credit to be given to
    the partnership. Holliday v. Union Bag Co., 3 Colo. 342

    <P>
    <B>Section 7-61-117, when considered in conjunction with this
    section and § 7-61-118, does not bar suit nor entry of
    judgment</B>and only reflects that a limited partner "shall not
    receive" a cash distribution in preference to creditors of the
    partnership when such distribution would result in insufficient
    assets remaining to pay creditors. Horizon Venture v. Horizon

    <B>The word "contributions" as it is used in this section is
    limited</B>to the contribution to be made by the limited

    general purpose and intent by the general assembly to encourage
    trade by authorizing and permitting a capitalist to put his
    money into a partnership with general partners possessed of
    skill and business character only without becoming a general
    partner or hazarding anything in the business except the

    interested in the success thereof to the extent of rendering
    services does not, in and of itself, violate the provisions of

    <P>
    <B>A limited partnership that is void as to a limited partner
    is not void as to the general partners.</B>The general partners
    were liable because at the time the limited partnership's
    obligation to the lender arose, all parties had contracted in
    accordance with their belief based on the filing of a
    partnership certificate with the secretary of state that a
    limited partnership existed. Therefore, the general partners
    were jointly and severally liable when they executed a note and
    deed of trust to the lender. Also, because the limited
    partnership benefitted from the proceeds of the loan, the
    general partners were estopped from denying the validity of
    their acts on behalf of the limited partnership. Finally,
    regardless of when the limited partnership was dissolved, the
    general partners were not relieved of their personal liability
    for the partnership's obligations by virtue of the dissolution.

  the obligation to purchase. The action shall be commenced within
  one hundred twenty days after the partnership has tendered
  payment or an offer to pay or within one year after written
  demand for payment if no payment or offer to pay is tendered. The
  court shall determine the buyout price of the dissociated
  partner's interest, any offset due under subsection (3) of this
  section, and accrued interest and enter judgment for any
  additional payment or refund. If deferred payment is authorized
  under subsection (8) of this section, the court shall also
  determine the security for payment and other terms of the

  attorneys' fees and the fees and expenses of appraisers or other
  experts for a party to the action, in amounts the court finds
  equitable, against a party that the court finds acted
  arbitrarily, vexatiously, or not in good faith. The finding may
  be based on the partnership's failure to tender payment or an

  effect to the distribution, all liabilities of the limited
  liability partnership or limited liability limited partnership,
  other than liabilities to general partners on account of their
  partnership interests and liabilities for which the recourse of
  creditors is limited to specified property of the partnership,

  that the fair value of property that is subject to a liability
  for which the recourse of creditors is limited shall be included
  in the assets of the partnership only to the extent that the fair
  value of that property exceeds that liability. For purposes of
  this section and sections 7-62-607 and 7-62-608, the term
  "distribution" shall not include payments to the extent that the
  payments do not exceed amounts equal to or constituting
  reasonable compensation for present or past services or

  pursuant to a bona fide retirement plan or other benefits
  program.</M>

    <B>Annotator's note.</B>Since § 7-71-101 is similar to §
    7-71-101 as it existed prior to the 2006 repeal and reenactment
    of this article, relevant cases construing that provision have
    been included in the annotations to this section.</P>
    <P>
    <B>The purpose of this section</B>is to afford the public the
    means of ascertaining the individual names of persons doing
    business under a common name where such names could not be
    found in the common name itself. Smith v. Stubbs, 16 Colo. App.
    130, 63 P. 955 (1901).</P>
    <P>Registration of a certificate of assumed or trade name
    pursuant to this section is intended only to afford the public
    a means of ascertaining the identities of persons or entities
    doing business under an assumed name and adds nothing to the
    common law relating to trademarks or unfair competition.
    MacPhail v. Stevens, 41 Colo. App. 99, 586 P.2d 1339
    (1978).</P>
    <P>
    <B>However, this section makes no requirement of
    recordation;</B>it is enough if the instrument is filed and
    thereafter kept in the office of the county clerk and recorder.
    Wallace Plumbing Co. v. Dillon, 71 Colo. 224, 205 P. 950
    (1922).</P>
    <P>
    <B>Applied</B>in Rosebud Corp. v. Boggio, 39 Colo. App. 84, 561
    P.2d 367 (1977); Masinton v. Dean, 659 P.2d 50 (Colo. App.

    <ANNO-TEXT>
    <B>A partnership using a company name must file</B>with the
    county clerk and recorder an affidavit setting forth the names
    and addresses of its members. Fisher v. Colorado Cent. Power
    Co., 94 Colo. 218, 29 P.2d 641 (1934). 
    <P>
    <B>But not when surnames used.</B>This section does not apply
    to a partnership of two members doing business under a name
    composed of the surnames of the partners. Smith v. Stubbs, 16
    Colo. App. 130, 63 P. 955 (1901).</P>
    <P>
    <B>Nor in case of nonresident partnership.</B>A nonresident
    partnership having its principal place of business outside of
    the state from which it transacts business through salesmen
    coming into the state is not "doing business in this state"
    within the meaning of that phrase as used in this section, and
    consequently, it has no application to such partnerships. Doll
    v. Rodgers, 98 Colo. 36, 52 P.2d 1147 (1935).</P>
    <P>
    <B>An affidavit is insufficient under this section</B>where it
    does not contain the full name or the address of the person
    represented by the company. Wallace Plumbing Co. v. Dillon, 71
    Colo. 224, 205 P. 950 (1922).</P>
    <P>
    <B>Failure to comply with the provisions of this section is a
    matter of abatement</B>to be pleaded in the answer, and if not
    pleaded, one cannot raise the objection upon the trial of the
    case. Smith v. Stubbs, 16 Colo. App. 130, 63 P. 955 (1901);
    Rocky Mt. Seed Co. v. McArthur, 85 Colo. 1, 272 P. 1117
    (1928).</P>
    <P>Defense of plaintiff's failure to comply with this statute
    must be affirmatively pleaded, and where the defendants failed
    to so plead they are estopped from raising the objection at a
    later time. Zambruk v. Perlmutter 3rd Generation Bldrs., Inc.,
    32 Colo. App. 276, 510 P.2d 472 (1973).</P>
    <P>
    <B>But an allegation in an answer that plaintiff has failed to
    file an affidavit</B>as required by this section and should not
    bring the action is a good defense, and a motion to strike it
    out may be properly denied. Elgin Jewelry Co. v. Wilson, 42
    Colo. 270, 93 P. 1107 (1908).</P>
    <P>
    <B>Moreover, dismissal proper where variance between affidavit
    and caption in complaint.</B>In an action by a party doing
    business under the trade name, a dismissal is proper where a
    variance is shown between the statutory affidavit on record and
    the caption in the complaint. Michard v. Myron Stratton Home,
    144 Colo. 251, 355 P.2d 1078 (1960).</P>
    <P>
    <B>However, upon correction of the caption,</B>or the filing of
    a new trade name affidavit to conform to the complaint, the
    action may be reinstated. Michard v. Myron Stratton Home, 144
    Colo. 251, 355 P.2d 1078 (1960).</P>
    <P>
    <B>And only issue at new trial is compliance with this
    section.</B>Where a cause of action is reversed on the ground
    that the plaintiff, an individual doing business under a trade
    name, has failed to file the affidavit required by this
    section, the only issue on a new trial is that of compliance
    with the statute. Wallace Plumbing Co. v. Dillon, 71 Colo. 224,
    205 P. 950 (1922).</P>
    <P>
    <B>For it is not necessary that there be a new trial as to any
    issue except</B>the one as to the filing of a proper trade name
    affidavit, since plaintiff's failure to file the proper
    affidavit is merely a matter in abatement. Admiral Corp. v.
    Trio Television Sales &amp; Serv. Corp., 138 Colo. 157, 330
    P.2d 1106 (1958); Michard v. Myron Stratton Home, 144 Colo.
    251, 355 P.2d 1078 (1960); Campbell v. Graham, 144 Colo. 532,
    357 P.2d 366 (1960).</P>
    <P>
    <B>And the affidavit may be filed at any time prior</B>to the
    new trial. Wallace Plumbing Co. v. Dillon, 71 Colo. 224, 205 P.
    950 (1922).</P></ANNO-TEXT>

    <B>Foreign corporation not excluded from transacting business
    under assumed name.</B>The phrase, "any corporation existing
    under the laws of this state", in this section is not intended
    to exclude foreign corporations from the right to transact all
    or a part of its business under an assumed name. Admiral Corp.
    v. Trio Television Sales &amp; Serv., Inc., 138 Colo. 157, 330
    P.2d 1106 (1958). 
    <P>
    <B>Hence, a foreign corporation can resort to court
    action</B>to enforce its rights if it carries on its business
    in any name other than that adopted in the state where it is
    incorporated. Admiral Corp. v. Trio Television Sales &amp;

    <P>
    <B>And where a foreign corporation doing business in Colorado
    under an assumed name fails to comply</B>with this section

    during the time the required certificate remains unrecorded.

    <B>The following factors are considered in determining whether
    certain information is a trade secret:</B>(1) The extent to
    which the information is known outside the business; (2) the
    extent to which the information is known to those inside the
    business; (3) the precautions taken by the holder of the trade

    effected and the value to the holder in having the information
    as against competitors; (5) the amount of effort or money

    <P>
    <B>The act of keeping a design secret does not necessarily mean
    that it is a trade secret.</B>Rather, the design itself must be
    secret; focusing on the act of protecting the design's secrecy

    <B>A trade secret can exist in a combination of characteristics
    and components each of which, by itself, is in the public
    domain,</B>but the unified process, design, and operation of
    which, in unique combination, affords a competitive advantage

    <P>
    <B>A trade secret can include a system where the elements are
    in the public domain,</B>but there has been accomplished an
    effective, successful, and valuable integration of the public
    domain elements and the trade secret gave the claimant a
    competitive advantage that is protected from misappropriation.

    <P>
    <B>It is error for the court to rule as a matter of law that
    customer lists are not trade secrets</B>particularly when
    presentation of evidence and offers of proof were not
    permitted. Network Telecomm. v. Boor-Crepeau, 790 P.2d 901
    (Colo. App. 1990).</P>
    <P>Adoption of a per se rule that a bid on a contract cannot be
    a trade secret as a matter of law is also declined. The
    statutory definition of "trade secret", together with evidence
    of value and of measures to protect disclosure, is broad enough
    to include a bid on a contract. Ovation Plumbing, Inc. v.
    Furton, 33 P.3d 1221 (Colo. App. 2001).</P>
    <P>
    <B>Precautions taken pursuant to subsection (4) must be more
    than normal business procedures.</B>Such efforts may include
    advising employees of the existence of a trade secret, limiting
    access to a need-to-know basis, and controlling access to
    locations where the information may be learned. Harvey Barnett,

    <P>
    <B>State claims not preempted by federal copyright

  <M>Except to the extent that a material and prejudicial change of
  position prior to acquiring knowledge or reason to know of
  misappropriation renders a monetary recovery inequitable, a

  Damages may include both the actual loss caused by
  misappropriation and the unjust enrichment caused by
  misappropriation that is not taken into account in computing
  actual loss. In lieu of damages measured by any other methods,
  the damages caused by misappropriation may be measured by

  secret.</M>

    <B>This section is the only part of the Colorado Limited

    liability company (LLC) context.</B>Sheffield Servs. Co. v.
    Trowbridge, 211 P.3d 714 (Colo. App. 2009). 
    <P>
    <B>The plain language of subsection (1) does not prohibit a
    court from applying the equitable common law doctrine of
    piercing the corporate veil to hold a manager of an LLC
    personally liable for the LLC's alleged improper
    actions.</B>Sheffield Servs. Co. v. Trowbridge, 211 P.3d 714
    (Colo. App. 2009), overruled in Weinstein v. Colborne
    Foodbotics, LLC, 2013 CO 33, 302 P.3d 263.</P>
    <P>
    <B>It is presumed that, in adopting subsection (1), the general
    assembly did not intend to create a safe harbor for LLC
    managers to perpetrate fraud and deceit.</B>To construe
    subsection (1) as precluding application of the common law
    doctrine of piercing the corporate veil to LLC managers would
    open the door to fraud. Sheffield Servs. Co. v. Trowbridge, 211
    P.3d 714 (Colo. App. 2009), overruled in Weinstein v. Colborne
    Foodbotics, LLC, 2013 CO 33, 302 P.3d 263.</P>
    <P>
    <B>A court determining whether to pierce the corporate veil of
    an LLC must tread carefully in light of subsection
    (2),</B>particularly where the company in question is a
    single-member LLC and where management of the LLC is provided
    under contract by a management company. Sedgwick Props. Dev.
    Corp. v. Hinds, 2019 COA 102, 456 P.3d 64.</P>
    <P>
    <B>Absent a statutory restriction, the common law piercing
    doctrine applies to LLC managers.</B>Because allowing a manager
    of an LLC to hide behind the LLC's cloak of limited liability
    would promote injustice, protect fraud, or defeat legitimate
    creditors' claims, the equitable common law doctrine of
    piercing the corporate veil may be applied to hold an LLC
    manager personally liable for the LLC's improper actions.
    Sheffield Servs. Co. v. Trowbridge, 211 P.3d 714 (Colo. App.
    2009), overruled in Weinstein v. Colborne Foodbotics, LLC, 2013
    CO 33, 302 P.3d 263.</P>
    <P>
    <B>Absent statutory authority, the manager of an insolvent LLC
    does not owe the LLC's creditors the same fiduciary duty that
    an insolvent corporation's directors owe the corporation's
    creditors.</B>Since the LLC act does not extend corporation
    common law to an LLC in any instance except a veil-piercing
    claim, creditors of an LLC may not assert a claim of breach of
    fiduciary duty against managers of an LLC. Weinstein v.
    Colborne Foodbotics, LLC, 2013 CO 33, 302 P.3d 263 (overruling

  <M>A limited liability company shall not make a distribution to a
  member to the extent that at the time of distribution, after
  giving effect to the distribution, all liabilities of the limited
  liability company, other than liabilities to members on account
  of their membership interests and liabilities for which the
  recourse of creditors is limited to a specific property of the
  limited liability company, exceed the fair value of the assets of
  the limited liability company; except that the fair value of
  property that is subject to a liability for which the recourse of
  creditors is limited shall be included in the assets of the
  limited liability company only to the extent that the fair value
  of that property exceeds that liability. For purposes of this
  subsection (1), the term "distribution" shall not include
  payments to the extent that the payments do not exceed amounts
  equal to or constituting reasonable compensation for present or
  past services or reasonable payments made in the ordinary course
  of business pursuant to a bona fide retirement plan or other

  subsection (1) of this section, and who knew at the time of the

  for the amount of the distribution. A member who receives a
  distribution in violation of subsection (1) of this section, and
  who did not know at the time of the distribution that the
  distribution violated subsection (1) of this section, shall not
  be liable for the amount of the distribution. Subject to
  subsection (3) of this section, this subsection (2) shall not
  affect any obligation or liability of a member under an agreement
  or other applicable law for the amount of a distribution.</M></P>
  <P N="(3)">(3)
  <M>Unless otherwise agreed, a member who receives a distribution
  from a limited liability company shall have no liability under
  this article or other applicable law for the amount of the
  distribution after the expiration of three years from the date of
  the distribution unless an action to recover the distribution
  from such member is commenced prior to the expiration of the said
  three-year period and an adjudication of liability against such
  member is made in the said action.</M></P></SECTION-TEXT>

    <B>An LLC member's interest in the LLC is an intangible
    personal property interest, and, for purposes of enforcing a
    charging order, that interest is located in the state where the
    LLC was formed.</B>JP Morgan Chase Bank, N.A. v. McClure, 2017
    CO 22, 393 P.3d 955. 
    <P>
    <B>Where there are no other members in the limited liability
    company (LLC), the debtor's bankruptcy filing effectively
    assigned her entire membership interest in the LLC to the
    bankruptcy estate,</B>and the trustee obtained all of the
    debtor's rights, including the right to control the management
    of the LLC. In re Albright, 291 B.R. 538 (Bankr. D. Colo.
    2003).</P>
    <P>
    <B>Because the trustee became the sole member of the LLC upon
    the debtor's bankruptcy filing, the trustee controls, directly
    or indirectly, all governance of that entity,</B>including any
    decision regarding liquidation of the entity's assets.
    Therefore, the trustee may cause the LLC to sell its property
    and distribute net proceeds to the bankruptcy estate.
    Alternatively, the trustee may elect to distribute the LLC's
    property to the bankruptcy estate, and, in turn, liquidate the
    property himself. In re Albright, 291 B.R. 538 (Bankr. D. Colo.

    <B>Agreement that required prior written approval of any

    <P>
    <B>Membership interest may be a "security".</B>The presumption
    that a general partnership interest is not a security is not
    applicable to a limited liability partnership interest in
    Colorado. Instead, the structure of the entity and the terms of
    the agreement will control. Toothman v. Freeborn &amp; Peters,
    80 P.3d 804 (Colo. App. 2002).</P>
    <P>
    <B>Colorado law requires a secured creditor to enforce the
    security agreement and become admitted as a member before
    voting rights associated with membership interests pledged as
    collateral can be exercised.</B>Thus, neither the pledging of
    the membership rights as security nor the declaration of a
    breach by the secured party is sufficient to divest the
    pledging member of the right to vote. To hold otherwise would
    permit someone who is not a member or manager to control a
    limited liability company. In re Crossover Fin. I, LLC, 477

  application to a court of competent jurisdiction by any judgment
  creditor of a member, the court may charge the membership
  interest of the member with payment of the unsatisfied amount of
  the judgment with interest thereon and may then or later appoint
  a receiver of the member's share of the profits and of any other
  money due or to become due to the member in respect of the
  limited liability company and make all other orders, directions,
  accounts, and inquiries that the debtor member might have made,
  or that the circumstances of the case may require. To the extent
  so charged, except as provided in this section, the judgment
  creditor has only the rights of an assignee or transferee of the
  membership interest. The membership interest charged may be
  redeemed at any time before foreclosure. If the sale is directed
  by the court, the membership interest may be purchased without
  causing a dissolution with separate property by any one or more
  of the members. With the consent of all members whose membership
  interests are not being charged or sold, the membership interest
  may be purchased without causing a dissolution with property of

    <B>A decision-maker is "independent" within the meaning of this
    section if</B>he or she has neither a stake in the litigation
    nor a relationship with a defendant that would preclude making
    an unbiased judgment as to whether dismissal of a derivative
    action is in the limited liability company's (LLC's) best
    interests. Business, personal, or familial relationships with a
    defendant raise a question about whether the decision-maker is
    independent, but they are not dispositive. A court may find,
    under the facts before it in a given case, that the specific
    relationship at issue would not interfere with the
    decision-maker's independence. Young v. Bush, 2012 COA 47, 277
    P.3d 916. 
    <P>
    <B>Trial court should have allowed the plaintiff discovery to
    establish whether business and family relationships interfered
    with the LLC members' ability to exercise independent, unbiased
    judgment regarding maintenance of a derivative action</B>when
    the facts set forth in plaintiff's affidavit showed
    relationships sufficient to create a material question of fact
    as to the independence of the LLC members who made the best
    interests determination. Young v. Bush, 2012 COA 47, 277 P.3d
    916.</P>
    <P>
    <B>An inquiry in a derivative proceeding under this
    section</B>may be less searching and detailed than the
    investigations in corporate or limited partnership derivative
    action cases. The independence of the person making the
    determination regarding whether the derivative proceeding is in
    the best interests of the LLC is a matter of degree rather than
    an absolute. Young v. Bush, 2012 COA 47, 277 P.3d 916.</P>
    <P>
    <B>While subsection (1) does not appear to contemplate
    production of a written report or an investigation</B>as
    wide-ranging as those required in corporate derivative actions,
    it nevertheless requires that there be an inquiry producing
    facts sufficient to enable LLC members to make an informed and
    good-faith decision on whether maintenance of a derivative
    action is in the LLC's best interests. Young v. Bush, 2012 COA

  the merging entities, as well as all other things and causes of

  are preserved unimpaired in the same property, however held. All

    <B>Annotator's note.</B>Since § 7-90-701 is similar to §
    7-115-108 as it existed prior to the 2003 repeal and
    reenactment of article 115 of title 7 and former § 7-115-108 is
    similar to § 7-9-117 as it existed prior to the 1993
    recodification of the "Colorado Business Corporation Act",
    articles 101 to 117 of title 7, cases construing those
    provisions and their predecessors have been included in the
    annotations to this section.</P>
    <P>
    <B>Designation of "general manager" and not a named individual
    suffices.</B>The requirement of this section is met by the
    designation of the "general manager" of a corporation, residing
    at its principal place of business, as agent to receive service
    of process. It is not necessary to give the name of the
    particular person who happens at the date of the certificate to
    fill this position, inasmuch as the object of the statute can
    be best subserved by a certificate of the character filed, for
    the obvious reason that the death or resignation of the
    incumbent would not long interfere with the bringing of suits
    against the corporations. Goodwin v. Colo. Mtg. Inv. Co., 110
    U.S. 1, 3 S. Ct. 473, 28 L. Ed 47 (1884).</P>
    <P>
    <B>Similarly, the president and vice-president of a corporation
    are agents</B>of the corporation within the meaning of this
    section and it is not necessary that an officer serving process
    should specify in his return that he had served either of these
    officials in the capacity of agent when it appears that service
    was upon a specified official of the corporation, which carries
    with it the information by implication that service was upon an
    agent thereof. Comet Consol. Mining Co. v. Frost, 15 Colo. 310,
    25 P. 506 (1890); Venner v. Denver Union Water Co., 40 Colo.
    212, 90 P. 623 (1907).</P>
    <P>
    <B>A foreign corporation's failure to comply with this section
    must be pleaded</B>in the first instance; if one answers to the
    merits, the omission is waived. Watson v. Empire Cream

    172 Colo. 48, 469 P.2d 734 (1970).</P>
    <P>

    <P>
    <B>Determination of "doing business" is matter for
    court.</B>The absence of exact measures for the determination
    of what constitutes doing business in a state for the purpose
    of becoming amenable to the processes of the courts of the
    state and the lack of uniformity, taken together with the
    opportunity of the trial court to observe the witnesses and to
    weigh their testimony, all lend strength to the wisdom of
    leaving the matter to the trial court. Am. Type Founders Co. v.

    <P>
    <B>But each case must be decided ad hoc so to not violate due

    contact within the state so as to hold that a foreign
    corporation has subjected itself to in personam jurisdiction
    without violating due process clause under the fourteenth
    amendment of federal constitution is resolved on an ad hoc
    basis, namely, each case rests upon its own facts. Bolger v.

    <B>Purchaser failed to establish seller's status as an agent
    for a foreign manufacturer</B>where seller conducted an
    independent business, purchasing mobile homes outright and
    selling them in its own business. Hence a motion for

    <P>
    <B>Establishing beachhead for business activity and retaining

    "doing business"</B>within the state. Bolger v. Dial-A-Style
    Leasing Corp., 159 Colo. 44, 409 P.2d 517 (1966).</P>
    <P>
    <B>And since a foreign manufacturer maintained a local
    distributor in Colorado,</B>its sales activity was found to
    constitute doing business to the extent that service on
    secretary of state was valid service on the manufacturer, such
    determination resting largely in the sound discretion of the
    trial court. Am. Type Founders Co. v. District Court, 154 Colo.
    156, 389 P.2d 85 (1964).</P>
    <P>
    <B>But not a nonpresent parent corporation because of mere
    presence of subsidiary.</B>Although a corporation is totally
    owned by another corporation, the mere presence in Colorado of
    the wholly-owned subsidiary, standing alone, does not in and of
    itself subject the nonpresent parent corporation to the state's
    jurisdiction where the two companies are operated as distinct
    entities. Bolger v. Dial-A-Style Leasing Corp., 159 Colo. 44,
    409 P.2d 517 (1966).</P>
    <P>
    <B>Presence in the state has never been doubted when</B>the
    activities of a foreign corporation there have not only been
    continuous and systematic, but also give rise to the
    liabilities sued on, even though no consent to be sued or
    authorization to an agent to accept service of process has been
    given. Am. Type Founders Co. v. District Court, 154 Colo. 156,
    389 P.2d 85 (1964).</P>
    <P>
    <B>As where regular trips are made into the state to accept
    delivery.</B>A nonresident corporation is subject to
    substituted service by reason of its doing business within the
    state of Colorado where it conducts regular and continuous
    trips to the state for the purpose of accepting delivery of all
    the merchandise which it sells in another state and its entire
    operation depends on these regular and frequent trips into the
    state. Jones v. Wood, 208 F. Supp. 750 (D. Colo. 1962).</P>
    <P>
    <B>But where a foreign corporation is in Colorado for one
    instance,</B>and that was for a demonstration, this presence in
    not sufficient to constitute doing business in the state so as
    to subject the corporation to process of service of summons in
    Colorado. Bay Aviation Servs. Co. v. District Court, 149 Colo.
    542, 370 P.2d 752 (1962).</P>

    <B>Restrictions on interstate commerce may not be

    a foreign corporation may do business within the state may not
    impose any restrictions or burdens on interstate commerce.

    299, 92 P. 727 (1907).</P>
    <P>
    <B>Thus this section cannot be construed to impose upon foreign
    corporations limitations on making contracts for carrying on
    commerce between the states,</B>for that would make the act an
    invasion of the exclusive right of Congress to regulate
    commerce among the several states. Cooper Mfg. Co. v. Ferguson,
    113 U.S. 727, 5 S. Ct. 739, 28 L. Ed. 1137 (1885).</P>
    <P>
    <B>And so foreign corporations engaged solely in interstate
    commerce are impliedly excepted from this section</B>imposing
    duties and obligations upon foreign corporations generally;
    otherwise the section must necessarily be held unconstitutional
    as invading the exclusive power of Congress. Herman Bros. Co.
    v. Nasiacos, 46 Colo. 208, 103 P. 301 (1909).</P>
    <P>
    <B>This section and § 10 of art. XV, Colo. Const., do not
    forbid, the doing of a single act of business</B>in the state,
    but the carrying on of business by a foreign corporation
    without the filing of the certificate and the appointment of an
    agent as required by the statute. Cooper Mfg. Co. v. Ferguson,
    113 U.S. 727, 5 S. Ct. 739, 28 L. Ed. 1137 (1885).</P>
    <P>
    <B>For to "transact business" within the meaning of this
    section is</B>to maintain an office, have capital invested, and
    carry on a regular business in the state. Cockburn v. Kinsley,
    25 Colo. App. 89, 135 P. 1112 (1913); Colo. Iron-Works v.
    Sierra Grande Mining Co., 15 Colo. 499, 25 P. 325 (1890).</P>
    <P>
    <B>And so a single transaction is not "transacting
    business".</B>Cockburn v. Kinsley, 25 Colo. App. 89, 135 P.
    1112 (1913).</P>
    <P>
    <B>Nor does "transacting business" include</B>the mere sale of
    shares, measures taken for promoting the affairs of the
    corporation, or meetings of the directors for such purposes
    only. Cockburn v. Kinsley, 25 Colo. App. 89, 135 P. 1112
    (1913).</P>
    <P>
    <B>Corporation without certificate must defend
    lawsuits.</B>Although a foreign corporation which does not
    obtain a certificate of authority has no right to transact
    business in Colorado, such corporation maintains its corporate
    identity with respect to its contracts and other acts, and it
    cannot refuse to defend lawsuits in Colorado courts. Nat'l

  secretary of state, the court may further stay the proceeding
  until there is a statement of foreign entity authority on file
  with the secretary of state with respect to the foreign entity.
  If a foreign entity has a statement of foreign entity authority

  calendar year during which it transacted business or conducted
  activities in this state without being authorized to do so, plus
  all penalties imposed by this state pursuant to subsection (3) of
  this section for failure to pay such fees. No statement of
  foreign entity authority shall be filed until payment of the

  <P N="(3)">(3)
  <M>A foreign entity that transacts business or conducts

  subsection (2) of this section and the civil penalties set forth

  the city and county of Denver. Upon a finding by the court that a
  foreign entity or any of its managers or agents on its behalf has
  transacted business or conducted activities in this state in
  violation of this part 8, the court may issue, in addition to or
  in lieu of the imposition of a civil penalty, an injunction
  restraining the further transaction of business or conducting of
  activities by the foreign entity and the managers and agents, and
  the further exercise of any rights and privileges of an entity in
  this state until all amounts plus any interest and court costs
  that the court may assess have been paid, and until the foreign

  <M>Notwithstanding subsection (1) of this section, the

  not impair the validity of the acts of the foreign entity or
  prevent it from defending any proceeding in this

    <B>If an application under § 7-115-101 is filed before
    trial,</B>the failure to file until after the six-year deadline
    for filing application for finding of reasonable diligence
    pursuant to § 37-92-301 does not divest the water court of
    jurisdiction. Municipal Subdist., N. Colo. Water Conservancy
    Dist. v. Getty Oil Exploration Co., 997 P.2d 557 (Colo.
    2000).</P>
    <P>
    <B>Corporation must defend lawsuits.</B>Although a foreign
    corporation which does not obtain a certificate of authority
    has no right to transact business in Colorado, such corporation
    maintains its corporate identity with respect to its contracts
    and other acts, and it cannot refuse to defend lawsuits in
    Colorado courts. Nat'l Ass'n of Credit Mgt. v. Burke, 645 P.2d
    1323 (Colo. App. 1982).</P>
    <P>
    <B>A foreign corporation's omission to allege in its complaint
    that it has complied with this section</B>can relate only to
    its capacity to sue and is not one of the facts necessary to
    constitute its cause of action. Page Woven Wire Fence Co. v.
    Joslin, 38 Colo. 162, 88 P. 142 (1906).</P>
    <P>
    <B>And a foreign corporation which has never done any business
    in Colorado may sue without paying any fees</B>to the state
    pursuant to this section. Desserich v. Merle &amp; Heaney Mfg.
    Co. 48 Colo. 370, 109 P. 949 (1910).</P>
    <P>
    <B>As this section is intended to govern intrastate
    commerce</B>and does not apply to interstate commerce or to the
    right of a foreign corporation to institute and defend suits in
    the federal courts. Butler Bros. Shoe Co. v. United States
    Rubber Co., 156 F. 1 (8th Cir. 1907); Herman Bros. Co. v.
    Nasiacos, 46 Colo. 208, 103 P. 301 (1909).</P>

    <B>Business not sufficiently intrastate</B>to bring corporation
    within the scope of this section. Cement Asbestos Prods. Co. v.
    Hartford Accident &amp; Indem. Co., 592 F.2d 1144 (10th Cir.
    1979).</P>
    <P>
    <B>Question of transaction of business involves factual
    matters.</B>The question whether the plaintiff is transacting
    business in Colorado for the purposes of this section involves
    factual matters. Viva, Ltd. v. United States, 490 F. Supp. 1002
    (D. Colo. 1980).</P>
    <P>
    <B>But no compulsion if solely in interstate commerce.</B>A
    foreign corporation may not be compelled to qualify in this
    state if it is engaged solely in interstate commerce. Cement
    Asbestos Prods. Co. v. Hartford Accident &amp; Indem. Co., 592
    F.2d 1144 (10th Cir. 1979); Viva, Ltd. v. United States, 490 F.
    Supp. 1002 (D. Colo. 1980).</P>
    <P>
    <B>Also, there is nothing in this section which prohibits
    foreign corporations from acquiring personal property in
    Colorado.</B>And having acquired it, they have the right to
    protect it from unlawful interference; if this were not true,
    persons might appropriate such property to their own use
    without fear of punishment. Craig v. A. Leschen &amp; Sons Rope
    Co., 38 Colo. 115, 87 P. 1143 (1906).</P>
    <P>
    <B>Limitation on right of foreign corporations to bring
    lawsuits held inapplicable.</B>Where foreign corporation sued
    in the Colorado federal court to quiet title to property
    against which a federal tax lien had been imposed based upon
    assessments against an individual taxpayer claimed to have an
    interest in the corporation and its property, the state
    limitation on right of foreign corporations to bring lawsuits
    did not apply. Viva, Ltd. v. United States, 490 F. Supp. 1002
    (D. Colo. 1980).</P>
    <P>
    <B>Liability not extended to corporation's officers,
    stockholders, or incorporators.</B>In the absence of definite
    statutory authority therefor, officers, stockholders,
    incorporators, or other persons contracting for or on behalf of
    a noncomplying foreign corporation cannot be held liable on its
    contracts as partners. Nat'l Ass'n of Credit Mgt. v. Burke, 645
    P.2d 1323 (Colo. App. 1982).</P>
    <P>
    <B>Liens.</B>The assertion and filing of a lien is not a
    "proceeding in court" within the meaning of this statute.
    Filing a lien qualifies as a "corporate act" within the meaning
    of the statute. Bob Blake Builders, Inc. v. Gramling, 18 P.3d

    <P>
    <B>This section recognizes that a foreign corporation has a
    corporate existence</B>in Colorado if it complies with the
    provisions of this article. Admiral Corp. v. Television Sales
    &amp; Serv., Inc., 138 Colo. 157, 330 P.2d 1106 (1958).</P>
    <P>
    <B>But a foreign corporation cannot legally carry on business
    in Colorado until</B>it complies with § 7-9-101 regulating the
    admission of foreign corporations to do business in this state;
    after such compliance, it becomes a corporation existing under
    the law of this state. Admiral Corp. v. Television Sales &amp;
    Serv., Inc., 138 Colo. 157, 330 P.2d 1106 (1958).</P>
    <P>
    <B>Foreign corporation qualified to do business may use assumed
    name.</B>A foreign corporation, having qualified to do business
    in Colorado, is a corporation existing under the laws of this
    state within the meaning of § 7-71-101 providing for filing of
    assumed names. The right of a foreign corporation to transact
    business under an assumed name relates only to the remedies
    available to it in the enforcement of its contracts, and where
    it is provided as in this section that a foreign corporation
    shall have the same power as a domestic corporation, and
    domestic corporations are given the power to conduct their
    business under an assumed name upon compliance with the
    statute, foreign corporations may exercise the same power upon
    compliance with the applicable statute. Admiral Corp. v.
    Television Sales &amp; Serv., Inc., 138 Colo. 157, 330 P.2d

    <P>
    <B>Whether the term "corporation" when used in this code
    applies to foreign corporations</B>as well as domestic
    corporations depends upon the subject matter of the statute,
    its policy, and the context in which the term is employed.

    <P>
    <B>A foreign corporation transacting business in Colorado is
    subject to the same rules, regulations, and restrictions
    applicable to domestic corporations</B>by virtue of this
    section. Holmes v. Jewett, 55 Colo. 187, 134 P. 665 (1913).</P>
    <P>Since nothing in the language of § 7-5-117 indicates an
    intent by the general assembly to limit its effect to domestic
    corporations, it also applies to foreign corporations as
    contemplated by this section. Jefferson Indus. Bank v. First

    Ins. v. Kornegay, 2012 COA 140, 292 P.3d 1111.</P>
    <P>
    <B>Accordingly, this section subjects a foreign corporation to
    all the liabilities of a domestic corporation</B>of like
    character which means that it shall not be subjected to any
    greater liabilities than are imposed upon a domestic
    corporation. Am. Smelting &amp; Ref. Co. v. Colo., 204 U.S.

  <M>Duties of directors.</M></CATCH-LINE>(1)
  <M>The board of directors shall manage or direct the business and

  the pecuniary interests of the shareholders, the best interests
  of those materially affected by the corporation's conduct, and
  the specific public benefit identified in its articles of
  incorporation.</M>
  <P N="(2)">(2)
  <M>A director of a public benefit corporation:</M></P>

  <M>Does not, by virtue of the public benefit provisions of
  section 7-101-503 (1), have a duty to any person on account of an

  affected by the corporation's conduct; and</M></P>
  <P N="(2)(b)">(b)
  <M>With respect to a decision implicating the balance requirement

  balancing requirement in subsection (1) of this section, except
  to the extent that the ownership or interest would create a
  conflict of interest if the corporation was not a public benefit
  corporation. In the absence of a conflict of interest, a failure
  to satisfy the balancing requirement specified in subsection (1)
  of this section does not, for the purposes of section 7-108-401
  or 7-108-403 or article 109 of this title 7, constitute an act or

    <P>
    <B>Annotator's note.</B>Since § 7-102-102 is similar to §
    7-2-102 as it existed prior to the 1993 recodification of the
    "Colorado Business Corporation Act", articles 101 to 117 of
    title 7, cases construing that provision and its predecessors
    have been included in the annotations to this section.</P>
    <P>
    <B>The essential prerequisite to the formation of a
    corporation</B>is articles of incorporation in form and
    substance as prescribed by statute. Humphreys v. Mooney, 5
    Colo. 282 (1880).</P>
    <P>
    <B>But none of the statements which the articles of
    incorporation are directed to contain are required to be made
    as condition precedent to the commencement or continuance of
    business</B>by the corporation. There is a broad and obvious
    distinction between such acts as are declared to be necessary
    steps in the process of incorporation and such as are required
    of the individuals seeking to become incorporated, but which
    are not made prerequisite to the assumption of corporate
    powers. In respect to the former, any material omission will be
    fatal to the existence of the corporation, and may be taken
    advantage of collaterally in any form in which the fact of
    incorporation can be called in question. In respect to the
    latter, the incorporation is responsible only to the government
    in a direct proceeding to forfeit the charter. The right to be
    considered a corporation and the exercise of corporate powers
    depends upon the fact of the performance of the particular acts
    named in the statute as essential to its corporate existence.
    Humphreys v. Mooney, 5 Colo. 282 (1880).</P>
    <P>
    <B>However, without a certificate of renewal or a bona fide
    attempt thereto, there is no corporation de facto,</B>where the
    company does not make any attempt by certificate or otherwise
    to renew its life. Bonfils v. Hayes, 70 Colo. 336, 201 P. 677
    (1921).</P>
    <P>
    <B>Prior to issuance of certificate of incorporation no de
    facto corporate status</B>regardless of substantial attempt to

    <B>Annotator's note.</B>Since § 7-103-102 is similar to §
    7-3-101 as it existed prior to the 1993 recodification of the
    "Colorado Business Corporation Act", articles 101 to 117 of
    title 7, cases construing that provision and its predecessors
    have been included in the annotations to this section.</P>
    <P>
    <B>The statutory powers of a corporation are specifically
    enumerated.</B>Herald Co. v. Seawell, 472 F.2d 1081 (10th Cir.
    1972).</P>
    <P>
    <B>Corporations may be formed for any lawful purpose,</B>and
    when so formed, they become bodies corporate and politic.
    Crystal Park Co. v. Morton, 27 Colo. App. 74, 146 P. 566
    (1915).</P>
    <P>
    <B>And of natural persons.</B>A private corporation formed
    under the provisions of this section for the purpose of
    carrying on a lawful business has all the rights, powers, and
    privileges of a natural person engaged in the same business.
    Crystal Park Co. v. Morton, 27 Colo. App. 74, 146 P. 566
    (1915).</P>
    <P>
    <B>Thus corporations may acquire fee simple title.</B>Where a
    corporation is empowered to acquire real estate without
    limitation in point of estate, it has the right to acquire a
    title in fee simple. Radetsky v. Jorgensen, 70 Colo. 423, 202
    P. 175 (1921).</P>
    <P>
    <B>So also a corporation may condemn land for a private way of
    necessity</B>where the nature of its business and the situation
    of its property require the way and where, under like
    conditions, other persons not corporate may condemn. Crystal
    Park Co. v. Morton, 27 Colo. App. 74, 146 P. 566 (1915).</P>
    <P>
    <B>And a corporation is entirely competent to transfer its
    property</B>through such agency as it may designate. Bliss v.
    Harris, 38 Colo. 72, 87 P. 1076 (1906).</P>
    <P>
    <B>May bring action benefitting parent corporation.</B>Even
    though the contract involved was entered into for the ultimate
    benefit of plaintiff's parent corporation, plaintiff is a real
    party in interest entitled to bring the action without joining
    its parent corporation. P &amp; M Vending Co. v. Half Shell of
    Boston, Inc., 41 Colo. App. 78, 579 P.2d 93 (1978).</P>
    <P>
    <B>Moreover, a right-of-way granted by a company does not cease
    with the expiration of its charter,</B>but, having previously
    been conveyed, its grantee may thereafter continue the use of
    the same. Bailey v. Platte &amp; Denver Canal Milling Co., 12
    Colo. 230, 21 P. 35 (1888).</P>
    <P>
    <B>Ultra vires no defense to notes where corporation has
    general power to incur indebtedness.</B>Where a water users'
    association was granted the general power to borrow money, to
    incur and promise to pay indebtedness, and to perform any other
    necessary or appropriate acts to acquire, maintain, and operate
    irrigation works, it had the general power to borrow money and
    to make its notes to repay it. Hence it was no defense to such
    notes that the money borrowed was used in furtherance of an
    ultra vires contract. Grand Valley Water Users' Ass'n v.
    Zumbrunn, 272 F. 943 (8th Cir. 1921).</P>
    <P>
    <B>Adoption and implementation of an employees stock trust
    plan</B>is clearly within the power and authority granted by
    this section to a corporation. Herald Co. v. Seawell, 472 F.2d
    1081 (10th Cir. 1972).</P>
    <P>
    <B>And the fact that a corporation has a substantial financial
    loss in its transfer of treasury stock to an employee's stock
    trust is of no consequence,</B>for subsection (1)(p)
    anticipates and authorizes a corporation to create such plans
    "wholly or partly at the expense of the corporation". Herald
    Co. v. Seawell, 472 F.2d 1081 (10th Cir. 1972).</P>
    <P>
    <B>Moreover, corporations through their directors may pay
    employees extra compensation</B>in the way of a bonus; and if
    properly authorized, it is neither a fraud upon dissenting
    stockholders nor against public policy, for the stage has long
    since been passed in which stockholders, who merely invest
    capital and leave it wholly to management to make it fruitful,
    can make absolutely exclusive claim to all profits against
    those whose labor, skill, ability, judgment, and effort have
    made profits available. Herald Co. v. Seawell, 472 F.2d 1081
    (10th Cir. 1972).</P>
    <P>
    <B>However, it is not a legitimate corporate activity to give
    away the resources of the corporation,</B>no matter how worthy
    or needy the donee may be, nor is it permissible by payment of
    excessive salaries or allowances to divert funds from
    stockholders to officers or directors without lawful reason.
    There is a distinction between using one's own resources for
    charitable projects or for proxy or control contests and using
    the resources of the corporation for those purposes. The law
    does not permit the use or diversion of corporate funds for
    purely personal purposes, no matter what form that diversion
    may take. Herald Co. v. Bonfils, 315 F. Supp. 497 (D. Colo.
    1970), rev'd on other grounds sub nom. Herald Co. v. Seawell,
    472 F.2d 1081 (10th Cir. 1972).</P>
    <P>
    <B>But subsection (1)(o) permits a corporation to indemnify its
    officers and directors</B>as against expenses incurred by them
    in connection with the defense of an action to which they are
    made parties by reason of having been such officer or director
    except in relation to matters as to which they shall be
    adjudged in such action to be liable for negligence or
    misconduct in the performance of duty; the statute permits a
    division of fees where a director or officer is not completely
    vindicated. Herald Co. v. Bonfils, 315 F. Supp. 497 (D. Colo.
    1970), rev'd on other grounds sub nom. Herald Co. v. Seawell,
    472 F.2d 1081 (10th Cir. 1972).</P>
    <P>
    <B>No attorneys fees for officer attacking corporate
    acts.</B>Subsection (1)(o) does not permit an award of
    attorneys fees to an officer who attacks corporate acts.
    Breniman v. Agricultural Consultants, Inc., 648 P.2d 165 (Colo.
    App. 1982).</P></ANNO-TEXT>

    <B>Stocks and bonds issued except as provided in this section

    <P>
    <B>Both § 9 of art. XV, Colo. Const. and this section are aimed
    at preventing the watering of corporate stock;</B>their purpose
    is to prevent corporations from issuing stock without receiving
    full value, and so to prevent the diluting of the holdings of
    innocent stockholders and the reliance by creditors on false or
    nonexistent capital resulting from the issuance of "watered"
    stock. Haselbush v. Alsco of Colo., Inc., 161 Colo. 138, 421
    P.2d 113 (1966).</P>
    <P>The policy behind § 7-4-105 (2) and § 9 of art. XV, Colo.
    Const., is to protect other stockholders of the corporation,
    creditors, and good faith future stockholders from the dilution
    of their investment by "watered" stock. Burch v. Exploration

    <B>But this purpose would not be served by holding that these
    provisions may be used to defeat an action by a corporation

    the issuance of stock when the transaction has been made in
    good faith. Haselbush v. Alsco of Colo., Inc., 161 Colo. 138,
    421 P.2d 113 (1966).</P>
    <P>The fact that the stock the plaintiff had contracted to
    purchase became worthless prior to his having made final
    payment on the note does not entitle plaintiff to recover
    amounts paid, nor does it furnish a justification for a refusal
    to pay the remainder due under the terms of the note. Moneys
    paid and to be paid belong to the creditors of the defendant
    corporation. Jacobs v. Frontier Tractor &amp; Equip., Inc., 712

    <P>
    <B>As this section does not forbid a corporation from taking a
    note or obligation from a perspective stockholder;</B>on the
    contrary, it impliedly recognizes the right to do so, but
    declares that no such note shall be considered as payment and
    no certificate shall issue until the note is paid. Haselbush v.
    Alsco of Colo., Inc., 161 Colo. 138, 421 P.2d 113 (1966);
    Jacobs v. Frontier Tractor &amp; Equip., Inc., 712 P.2d 493

    Colo. Const., and subsection (2) of this section may prohibit
    execution and delivery of share certificates in exchange for

    <B>Stock certificates which have been issued without authority
    and are not manually signed are nonetheless genuine,</B>and the
    statutory requirement of a transfer agent's countersignature on
    stock certificates bearing facsimile signatures does not render
    them invalid or preclude bona fide purchase. Dempsey-Tegeler
    &amp; Co. v. Otis Oil &amp; Gas Corp., 293 F. Supp. 1383 (D.
    Colo. 1968). 
    <P>
    <B>For noncompliance with this section does not render
    certificates nongenuine</B>or constitute an absolute defense
    effective against a purchaser for value and without notice
    under § 4-8-202 (3) of the commercial code, as certificates
    signed in facsimile are genuine under the uniform commercial
    code, "genuine" meaning free of forgery or counterfeiting. Thus
    even though certificates are issued without authority, it
    cannot be said that the signatures are either forged or
    counterfeit, and so in this sense they are effective against
    the issuer. Dempsey-Tegeler &amp; Co. v. Otis Oil &amp; Gas

    purchase. Hampton v. Tri-State Fin. Corp., 30 Colo. App. 420,
    495 P.2d 566 (1972).

    <P>
    <B>However, this section does not require that the certificate
    carry the exact restrictions on the certificate,</B>but only
    that the shareholder be informed by the certificate that upon
    request the corporation will furnish him with information as to
    classes of stock and their various restrictions. Hampton v.

    <P>
    <B>But the stock contract is voidable.</B>Absent a showing of
    actual knowledge at the time of purchase, failure to follow the

  <P N="(2)">(2)

  <M>The corporation's total assets would be less than the sum of
  its total liabilities plus (unless the articles of incorporation
  permit otherwise) the amount that would be needed, if the

  to satisfy the preferential rights upon dissolution of
  shareholders whose preferential rights are superior to those
  receiving the distribution.</M></P>
  <P N="(4)">(4)
  <M>The board of directors may base a determination that a
  distribution is not prohibited under subsection (3) of this
  section either on financial statements prepared on the basis of
  accounting practices and principles that are reasonable under the
  circumstances or on a fair valuation or other method that is
  reasonable under the circumstances.</M></P>
  <P N="(5)">(5)
  <M>Except as provided in subsection (6) of this section, the time
  for measuring the effect of a distribution under subsection (3)
  of this section is:</M></P>
  <P N="(5)(a)">(a)
  <M>In the case of distribution by purchase, redemption, or other
  acquisition of the corporation's shares, as of the earlier

  hundred twenty days after the date of authorization.</M></P>
  <P N="(6)">(6)
  <M>Indebtedness of a corporation, including indebtedness issued
  as a distribution, is not considered a liability for purposes of
  determinations under subsection (3) of this section if its terms
  provide that payment of principal and interest thereon are made
  only if and to the extent that payment of a distribution to
  shareholders could then be made under this section. If the
  indebtedness is issued as a distribution, each payment of
  principal or interest thereon is treated as a distribution the
  effect of which is measured on the date the payment is actually
  made.</M></P>
  <P N="(7)">(7)
  <M>Unless otherwise expressly provided in the articles of

  shall not impose any limitation on distributions and shall not
  require any separate designation, restriction, reservation, or

  <M>In any action pending, instituted, or maintained on or after
  January 1, 1959, in the right of any domestic or foreign
  corporation by a shareholder holding less than five percent of
  the outstanding shares of any class of such corporation or of
  voting trust certificates therefor, unless the shares or voting
  trust certificates so held have a market value in excess of
  twenty-five thousand dollars, the corporation in whose right such

  and reasonable expenses which may be directly attributable to and
  incurred by it in the defense of such action or may be incurred

  legally liable, but not including fees of attorneys. Market value
  shall be determined as of the date that the plaintiff institutes
  the action or, in the case of an intervenor, as of the date that
  the plaintiff becomes a party to the action. The amount of such
  security may from time to time be increased or decreased, in the
  discretion of the court, upon showing that the security provided
  has or may become inadequate or is excessive. If the court finds
  that the action was commenced without reasonable cause, the

    <P>
    <B>Or exercise statutory waivers.</B>It does not lie within the
    power of stockholders to exercise a statutory waiver in a
    matter concerning the corporation; rather the discretion to
    waive the protection afforded by such a statute can only be
    exercised by the governing officials of the corporation, namely
    the officers or the board of directors. Weck v. District Court,
    158 Colo. 521, 408 P.2d 987 (1965).</P>
    <P>
    <B>In bankruptcy the trustee acts for the directors.</B>Since
    the United States bankruptcy act confers broad powers upon a
    trustee in bankruptcy, such a trustee takes the place and
    exercises the office of the directors of a corporation in
    bankruptcy. Weck v. District Court, 161 Colo. 384, 422 P.2d 46
    (1967).</P>
    <P>
    <B>Directors occupy quasi-fiduciary relation to
    corporation.</B>In addition to their statutory powers and
    duties, directors of a corporation are in a broad sense agents
    of the corporation in that they occupy a quasi-fiduciary
    relation to the corporation and to its stockholders. Hence they
    must manage the corporate affairs in good faith within the
    limits of the law applicable and give the corporate entity the
    benefit of their best judgment and care. Herald Co. v. Seawell,
    472 F.2d 1081 (10th Cir. 1972).</P>
    <P>
    <B>Fiduciary duty to minority stockholder was not
    breached</B>when the directors interfered with shareholder's
    management contract with the corporation since the shareholder
    was acting in his capacity as an independent contractor under
    the management contract with the corporation rather than as a
    stockholder. Bithell v. W. Care Corp., 762 P.2d 708 (Colo. App.
    1988).</P>
    <P>
    <B>Discretionary powers, if honestly exercised, are not subject
    to control.</B>Within the limits of their legal authority,
    directors of a corporation possess by necessity a large amount
    of discretionary power, and that power, if exercised honestly
    and with reason, is not subject to control by either the
    stockholders or the courts. Herald Co. v. Seawell, 472 F.2d
    1081 (10th Cir. 1972).</P>
    <P>Courts will not, at the instance of stockholders or
    otherwise, interfere with or regulate the conduct of the
    directors in the reasonable and honest exercise of their
    judgment and duties. Rywalt v. Writer Corp., 34 Colo. App. 334,
    526 P.2d 316 (1974).</P>
    <P>
    <B>Thus courts will accept business judgments unless
    unlawful.</B>Since management, backed by majority stock
    control, has a wide discretion in making business judgments, a
    court will hospitably accept those business judgments when made
    with an eye single to the interest of the corporation unless
    manifestly unlawful. Herald Co. v. Bonfils, 315 F. Supp. 497
    (D. Colo. 1970), rev'd on other grounds sub nom. Herald v.
    Seawell, 472 F.2d 1081 (10th Cir. 1972).</P>
    <P>The good faith acts of directors which are within the powers
    of the corporation and within the exercise of an honest
    business judgment are valid. Rywalt v. Writer Corp., 34 Colo.
    App. 334, 526 P.2d 316 (1974).</P>
    <P>
    <B>But when self-interest or improper motives are
    indicated</B>inconsistent with legitimate corporate purposes or
    basic principles on which corporations must operate, the court
    has a duty to carefully scrutinize action by the directors to
    determine whether it was within the perimeter of permissible
    action. Herald Co. v. Bonfils, 315 F. Supp. 497 (D. Colo.
    1970), rev'd on other grounds sub nom. Herald v. Seawell, 472
    F.2d 1081 (10th Cir. 1972).</P>
    <P>
    <B>Thus a contract employing director to secure a particular
    corporate action violates this section.</B>A contract of
    employment which obligates a director to assist one to control
    the corporate action of the company in securing a particular
    lease, regardless of his duty as a director to represent and
    act for all the stockholders alike is against the policy of the
    law under this section. Singers-Bigger v. Young, 166 F. 82 (8th
    Cir. 1908).</P>
    <P>
    <B>For a contract of this character would tend to deprive the
    stockholders</B>of the benefit of defendant's independent and
    impartial judgment, subordinate the interests of the
    corporation, which his duty required him to serve, to the
    individual interests of his employer, and would be contrary to
    public policy and void. Singers-Bigger v. Young, 166 F. 82 (8th
    Cir. 1908).</P>
    <P>
    <B>Remedy of stockholders dissatisfied with corporate
    management is electing new directors.</B>The officers and
    directors of a corporation are presumed to represent the will
    of a majority of the stockholders; thus, when stockholders
    simply become dissatisfied with corporate management,
    ordinarily the remedy is to install new management by the
    election of new directors. Weck v. District Court, 158 Colo.
    521, 408 P.2d 987 (1965); Herald Co. v. Seawell, 472 F.2d 1081

    duties, directors of a corporation are in a broad sense agents
    of the corporation in that they occupy a quasi-fiduciary
    relation to the corporation and to its stockholders. Hence they
    must manage the corporate affairs in good faith within the
    limits of the law applicable and give the corporate entity the
    benefit of their best judgment and care. Herald Co. v. Seawell,
    472 F.2d 1081 (10th Cir. 1972).</P>
    <P>
    <B>Fiduciary duty to minority stockholder was not
    breached</B>when the directors interfered with shareholder's
    management contract with the corporation since the shareholder
    was acting in his capacity as an independent contractor under
    the management contract with the corporation rather than as a
    stockholder. Bithell v. W. Care Corp., 762 P.2d 708 (Colo. App.
    1988).</P>
    <P>
    <B>Discretionary powers, if honestly exercised, are not subject
    to control.</B>Within the limits of their legal authority,
    directors of a corporation possess by necessity a large amount
    of discretionary power, and that power, if exercised honestly
    and with reason, is not subject to control by either the
    stockholders or the courts. Herald Co. v. Seawell, 472 F.2d
    1081 (10th Cir. 1972).</P>
    <P>Courts will not, at the instance of stockholders or
    otherwise, interfere with or regulate the conduct of the
    directors in the reasonable and honest exercise of their
    judgment and duties. Rywalt v. Writer Corp., 34 Colo. App. 334,
    526 P.2d 316 (1974).</P>
    <P>
    <B>Thus courts will accept business judgments unless
    unlawful.</B>Since management, backed by majority stock
    control, has a wide discretion in making business judgments, a
    court will hospitably accept those business judgments when made
    with an eye single to the interest of the corporation unless
    manifestly unlawful. Herald Co. v. Bonfils, 315 F. Supp. 497
    (D. Colo. 1970), rev'd on other grounds sub nom. Herald v.
    Seawell, 472 F.2d 1081 (10th Cir. 1972).</P>
    <P>The good faith acts of directors which are within the powers
    of the corporation and within the exercise of an honest
    business judgment are valid. Rywalt v. Writer Corp., 34 Colo.
    App. 334, 526 P.2d 316 (1974).</P>
    <P>
    <B>But when self-interest or improper motives are
    indicated</B>inconsistent with legitimate corporate purposes or
    basic principles on which corporations must operate, the court
    has a duty to carefully scrutinize action by the directors to
    determine whether it was within the perimeter of permissible
    action. Herald Co. v. Bonfils, 315 F. Supp. 497 (D. Colo.
    1970), rev'd on other grounds sub nom. Herald v. Seawell, 472
    F.2d 1081 (10th Cir. 1972).</P>
    <P>
    <B>Thus a contract employing director to secure a particular
    corporate action violates this section.</B>A contract of
    employment which obligates a director to assist one to control
    the corporate action of the company in securing a particular
    lease, regardless of his duty as a director to represent and
    act for all the stockholders alike is against the policy of the
    law under this section. Singers-Bigger v. Young, 166 F. 82 (8th
    Cir. 1908).</P>
    <P>
    <B>For a contract of this character would tend to deprive the
    stockholders</B>of the benefit of defendant's independent and
    impartial judgment, subordinate the interests of the
    corporation, which his duty required him to serve, to the
    individual interests of his employer, and would be contrary to
    public policy and void. Singers-Bigger v. Young, 166 F. 82 (8th
    Cir. 1908).</P>
    <P>
    <B>Remedy of stockholders dissatisfied with corporate
    management is electing new directors.</B>The officers and
    directors of a corporation are presumed to represent the will
    of a majority of the stockholders; thus, when stockholders
    simply become dissatisfied with corporate management,
    ordinarily the remedy is to install new management by the
    election of new directors. Weck v. District Court, 158 Colo.
    521, 408 P.2d 987 (1965); Herald Co. v. Seawell, 472 F.2d 1081
    (10th Cir. 1972).</P>
    <P>
    <B>This section gives directors express authority to fix
    compensation</B>and the fixing of salaries by directors falls
    within the "business judgment" rule. Herald Co. v. Seawell, 472
    F.2d 1081 (10th Cir. 1972).</P>
    <P>
    <B>Applied</B>in Masinton v. Dean, 659 P.2d 50 (Colo. App.

    the duty of exercising the powers of a corporation and, thus,
    are the ones who usually incur personal liability for breach of
    that duty, a stockholder may subject himself to similar

    <B>Stockholder liability does not arise from mere knowledge of

    <B>Section not inconsistent with provisions governing insurance
    companies.</B>The provision of this section that directors who
    declare a dividend while corporation is insolvent shall be
    liable for debts of corporation and § 10-3-204 making it
    unlawful for directors of an insurance company to declare
    dividends except from surplus or profits and providing
    penalties therefor are not inconsistent; rather § 10-3-204 does
    not purport to afford any relief from the burdens imposed by
    this section but declares similar acts of directors of
    insurance companies to be "unlawful" and fixes the punishment
    of one "found guilty". Guarantee Reserve Life Ins. Co. v.

    <P>
    <B>Thus insurance company directors are also answerable under
    this section.</B>The fact that a director of a corporation
    might be tried and punished for unlawful acts under § 10-3-204,
    providing for punishment for unlawful issuance of dividends by
    insurance companies, does not preclude his being answerable in
    a civil action under this section for the same acts though not

    <B>Directors of liquidated corporation are trustees for

    corporate property for their own benefit rather than making
    provision for the payment of creditors. Ficor, Inc. v. McHugh,

    corporation itself. It therefore follows that creditors may not
    sue directors personally under the statute. Rosebud Corp. v.
    Boggio, 39 Colo. App. 84, 561 P.2d 367 (1977).</P>
    <P>
    <B>But may sue them personally in appropriate
    cases.</B>Creditors are not precluded from suing directors and
    having them held personally liable for corporation obligations
    in appropriate cases. Former subsection (9) stated that the
    liabilities imposed on directors by virtue of this section were
    in addition to "any other liabilities imposed by law on
    directors of a corporation", and it follows that if a creditor
    establishes the breach of a common-law duty owed to him, for
    which directors may be held personally liable, dismissal of the
    claim would be improper. Rosebud Corp. v. Boggio, 39 Colo. App.
    84, 561 P.2d 367 (1977).</P>
    <P>Corporate entity may be disregarded and directors held
    personally liable if equity so requires, i.e. adherence to the
    corporate fiction would promote injustice, protect fraud,
    defeat a legitimate claim, or defend crime. La Fond v. Basham,
    683 P.2d 367 (Colo. App. 1984); Ward v. Cooper, 685 P.2d 1382
    (Colo. App. 1984); Micciche v. Billings, 727 P.2d 367 (Colo.
    1986).</P>
    <P>Since directors of an insolvent corporation are deemed to be
    trustees for it and its creditors, they owe a duty to the
    corporate creditors not to divest corporate property for their
    own benefit and thus defeat a creditor's claim. If the duty is
    breached, the creditors may sue the directors and hold them
    personally liable. Collie v. Becknell, 762 P.2d 727 (Colo. App.
    1988).</P>
    <P>
    <B>A director is personally liable</B>to the corporation only
    for that portion of the distribution that makes the corporation
    insolvent. Paratransit Risk Retention Group Ins. Co. v. Kamins,
    160 P.3d 307 (Colo. App. 2007).</P>
    <P>
    <B>Judgment creditors may enforce any cause of action belonging
    to corporation.</B>Although only the damaged corporation has a
    cause of action under subsection (3)(now subsection (1)(c)),
    judgment creditors of a corporation are entitled to enforce
    their judgments by enforcing any cause of action belonging to
    the corporation notwithstanding the fact that the corporation
    has been dissolved. McHugh v. Ficor, Inc., 43 Colo. App. 409,

    <P>
    <B>Although a director owes no general duty to use or pledge

  <M>A conflicting interest transaction is not void or voidable,
  shall not be enjoined or set aside, and does not give rise to an
  award of damages or other sanctions in a proceeding by a

  because it is a conflicting interest transaction or because the
  director is present at or participates in the meeting of the
  corporation's board of directors or of the committee of the board
  of directors that authorizes, approves, or ratifies the
  conflicting interest transaction or because the director's vote
  is counted for that purpose if:</M></P>

  <P N="(2)(b)(II)">(II)
  <M>If the articles of incorporation provide for voting on the

  authorizing, approving, or ratifying the conflicting interest
  transaction exceed the votes cast within the voting group in
  opposition; or</M></P>
  <P N="(2)(c)">(c)
  <M>The conflicting interest transaction is fair as to the
  corporation.</M></P>
  <P N="(3)">(3)
  <M>A director's taking advantage, directly or indirectly, of a
  corporate opportunity shall not be enjoined or set aside and does
  not give rise to an award of damages or other sanctions in a

  corporation, because the director took such advantage,
  if:</M></P>
  <P N="(3)(a)">(a)
  <M>The material facts as to the director's relationship or

  <P N="(3)(b)(II)">(II)
  <M>If the articles of incorporation provide for voting on the

  <M>Authority to indemnify directors.</M></CATCH-LINE>(1)
  <M>Except as provided in subsection (4) of this section, a
  corporation may indemnify an individual made a party to a
  proceeding, because the individual is or was a director, against
  liability incurred in the proceeding if:</M>
  <P N="(1)(a)">(a)
  <M>The individual's conduct was in good faith; and</M></P>
  <P N="(1)(b)">(b)
  <M>The individual reasonably believed:</M></P>
  <P N="(1)(b)(I)">(I)
  <M>In the case of conduct in an official capacity with the
  corporation, that the conduct was in the corporation's best
  interests; and</M></P>
  <P N="(1)(b)(II)">(II)
  <M>In all other cases, that the conduct was at least not opposed
  to the corporation's best interests; and</M></P>
  <P N="(1)(c)">(c)
  <M>In the case of any criminal proceeding, the individual had no
  reasonable cause to believe the individual's conduct was
  unlawful.</M></P>
  <P N="(2)">(2)
  <M>A director's conduct with respect to an employee benefit plan
  for a purpose the director reasonably believed to be in the
  interests of the participants in or beneficiaries of the plan is
  conduct that satisfies the requirement of subparagraph (II) of
  paragraph (b) of subsection (1) of this section. A director's
  conduct with respect to an employee benefit plan for a purpose
  that the director did not reasonably believe to be in the
  interests of the participants in or beneficiaries of the plan
  shall be deemed not to satisfy the requirements of paragraph (a)
  of subsection (1) of this section.</M></P>
  <P N="(3)">(3)
  <M>The termination of a proceeding by judgment, order,
  settlement, or conviction or upon a plea of nolo contendere or
  its equivalent does not, of itself, create a presumption that the
  director did not meet the relevant standard of conduct described
  in this section.</M></P>
  <P N="(4)">(4)
  <M>A corporation may not indemnify a director under this
  section:</M></P>
  <P N="(4)(a)">(a)
  <M>In connection with a proceeding by or in the right of the
  corporation in which the director was adjudged liable to the
  corporation except for reasonable expenses incurred in connection
  with the proceeding if it is determined that the director has met
  the relevant standard of conduct under subsection (1) of this
  section; or</M></P>
  <P N="(4)(b)">(b)
  <M>In connection with any other proceeding charging that the
  director derived an improper personal benefit, whether or not

  derived an improper personal benefit.</M></P>

    <P>
    <B>Annotator's note.</B>Since § 7-113-101 is similar to §
    7-4-124 as it existed prior to the 1993 recodification of the
    "Colorado Business Corporation Act", articles 101 to 117 of
    title 7, cases construing that provision have been included in
    the annotations to this section.</P>
    <P>
    <B>Purpose of dissenters' rights statutes</B>is to protect the
    property rights of dissenting shareholders from actions by
    majority shareholders that alter the character of their
    investment. M Life Ins. Co. v. Sapers &amp; Wallack Ins.
    Agency, Inc., 40 P.3d 6 (Colo. App. 2001).</P>
    <P>
    <B>Statutes, not bylaws of corporation, control valuation of
    shares.</B>However, the unique structure of the corporation, as
    expressed in its bylaws, is a relevant factor. M Life Ins. Co.
    v. Sapers &amp; Wallack Ins. Agency, Inc., 40 P.3d 6 (Colo.
    App. 2001).</P>
    <P>
    <B>Interpretation of "fair value".</B>Relying on case law
    interpreting "fair value" within the context of dissenters'
    rights statutes in other states, a determination of fair value
    is based on all relevant value factors considering the
    particular circumstances of the corporation involved. Such a
    determination is not premised upon any precise mathematical
    formula. Pioneer Bancorporation, Inc. v. Waters, 765 P.2d 597
    (Colo. App. 1988); M Life Ins. Co. v. Sapers &amp; Wallack Ins.
    Agency, Inc., 40 P.3d 6 (Colo. App. 2001).</P>
    <P>
    <B>"Fair value" connotes a broader approach to valuation than
    "fair market value".</B>In determining fair value, the court
    must consider all relevant value factors, the most important of
    which are market value, investment or earnings value, and net
    asset value. M Life Ins. Co. v. Sapers &amp; Wallack Ins.
    Agency, Inc., 40 P.3d 6 (Colo. App. 2001).</P>
    <P>
    <B>"Fair value" does not mean "fair market value";</B>it means
    a dissenting shareholder's proportionate interest in the
    corporation valued as a going concern. Pueblo Bancorporation v.
    Lindoe, Inc., 63 P.3d 353 (Colo. 2003); Crocker v. Greater
    Colo. Anesthesia, P.C., 2018 COA 33, 463 P.3d 860.</P>
    <P>
    <B>A marketability discount may, in appropriate circumstances,
    be applied in situations in which a closely held corporation's
    shares are valued under this section,</B>but such a
    determination is a factual one that must be made on an ad hoc
    basis. WCM Indus. v. Trustees of Wilson Trust, 948 P.2d 36
    (Colo. App. 1997) (decided under law as it existed prior to the
    1994 repeal of § 7-4-124).</P>
    <P>
    <B>Distinction between marketability discount and minority
    discount.</B>A minority discount adjusts for lack of control
    over the business entity on the theory that non-controlling
    shares of stock are not worth their proportionate share of the
    firm's value because they lack voting power to control
    corporate actions. A marketability discount adjusts for a lack
    of liquidity in one's interest in an entity, on the theory that
    there is a limited supply of potential buyers for stock in a
    closely held corporation. M Life Ins. Co. v. Sapers &amp;
    Wallack Ins. Agency, Inc., 40 P.3d 6 (Colo. App. 2001).</P>
    <P>
    <B>Finding of fair value is a factual determination.</B>As
    such, it will not be disturbed on appeal unless clearly
    erroneous. M Life Ins. Co. v. Sapers &amp; Wallack Ins. Agency,
    Inc., 40 P.3d 6 (Colo. App. 2001).</P>
    <P>
    <B>Defendant corporation owed dissenting stockholder the fair
    value, not the redemption value, for plaintiff's preferred
    stock.</B>Fair value is akin to fair market value, the value a
    shareholder would receive in an arms-length transaction, and
    not necessarily an existent redemptive value if the redemptive
    value is lower than fair market value. Breniman v. Agricultural
    Consultants, 829 P.2d 493 (Colo. App. 1992).</P>
    <P>Extraordinary actions of the corporation in selling off its
    property permit the dissenting shareholder to invoke this
    section to obtain fair value payment for his shares. Breniman
    v. Agricultural Consultants, 829 P.2d 493 (Colo. App.
    1992).</P>

  <M>Perfection of rights - right to withdraw.</M></CATCH-LINE>(1)
  <M>A shareholder that receives notice pursuant to section
  7-113-203 and that wishes to exercise appraisal rights must sign
  and return the form sent by the corporation and, in the case of
  certificated shares, deposit the shareholder's certificates in
  accordance with the terms of the notice by the date referred to
  in the notice given pursuant to section 7-113-203 (2)(b)(II). In
  addition, if applicable, the shareholder must certify on the form
  whether the beneficial owner of the shares acquired beneficial
  ownership of the shares before the date required to be set forth
  in the notice pursuant to section 7-113-203 (2)(a). If a
  shareholder fails to make this certification, the corporation may
  elect to treat the shareholder's shares as after-acquired shares
  under section 7-113-206. Once a shareholder deposits that
  shareholder's certificates or, in the case of uncertificated
  shares, returns the signed forms, that shareholder loses all
  rights as a shareholder unless the shareholder withdraws pursuant
  to subsection (2) of this section.</M>
  <P N="(2)">(2)
  <M>A shareholder who has complied with subsection (1) of this
  section may nevertheless decline to exercise appraisal rights and

  <M>The court in an appraisal proceeding commenced under section
  7-113-301 shall determine all costs of the proceeding, including
  the reasonable compensation and expenses of appraisers appointed
  by the court. The court shall assess the costs against the
  corporation; except that the court may assess costs against all
  or some of the shareholders demanding appraisal, in amounts the
  court finds equitable, to the extent the court finds the
  shareholders acted arbitrarily, vexatiously, or not in good faith
  with respect to the rights provided by this article 113.</M>

  <M>The court in an appraisal proceeding may also assess the fees

  <P N="(3)">(3)
  <M>If the court in an appraisal proceeding finds that the

  should not be assessed against the corporation, the court may
  direct that the expenses be paid out of the amounts awarded to
  the shareholders who were benefited.</M></P>

  <M>To the extent the corporation fails to make a required payment

    <B>Law reviews.</B>For article, "1959 Amendments to the
    Colorado Corporation Code", see 36 Dicta 489 (1959). 
    <P>
    <B>Annotator's note.</B>Since § 7-114-105 is similar to §
    7-8-122 as it existed prior to the 1993 recodification of the
    "Colorado Business Corporation Act", articles 101 to 117 of
    title 7, cases construing that provision and its predecessors
    have been included in the annotations to this section.</P>
    <P>
    <B>Statute of limitations applicable to dissolved foreign
    corporations.</B>Since this state has by subsection (1) adopted
    a two-year statute of limitations applicable to dissolved
    domestic corporations, it would be both illogical and
    unconstitutional to apply to a foreign corporation, which has
    been dissolved pursuant to the laws under which it is governed
    by its state of incorporation and which has received a
    certificate of withdrawal from this state, a statute of
    limitations which would subject it to liability for a period
    longer than that which this state would apply to a dissolved
    domestic corporation. Casselman v. Denver Tramway Corp., 39
    Colo. App. 306, 568 P.2d 84 (1977), rev'd on other grounds, 195
    Colo. 241, 577 P.2d 293 (1978).</P>
    <P>
    <B>Applied</B>in Kuehn v. Kuehn, 642 P.2d 524 (Colo. App.
    1981); Graham, Inc. v. Mtn. States Tel. &amp; Tel. Co., 680
    P.2d 1334 (Colo. App. 1984).</P></ANNO-TEXT>

    <M>SUITS AGAINST A DISSOLVED CORPORATION.</M></AN-DIV>
    <ANNO-TEXT>
    <B>Dissolution does not affect remedies against a
    corporation.</B>Dutton Hotel Co. v. Fitzpatrick, 69 Colo. 229,
    193 P. 549 (1920); Dick v. Petersen, 90 Colo. 83, 6 P.2d 923
    (1931). 
    <P>
    <B>And dissolution does not bar an action against a corporation
    upon a precedent cause of action.</B>Kipp v. Miller, 47 Colo.
    598, 108 P. 164 (1910).</P>
    <P>
    <B>However, this section,</B>although conferring capacity to
    sue and to be sued in certain cases, does not confer the
    dissolved corporation with federal standing under either the
    Sherman Act or the Clayton Act. Western Sys., Inc. v. Dynatech
    Corp., 610 F. Supp. 585 (D. Colo. 1985).</P>
    <P>
    <B>For this section continues the corporate capacity of a
    company to be sued</B>for liabilities which accrued before its
    dissolution. Lucifer Coal Co. v. Buster, 64 Colo. 179, 171 P.
    61 (1918); Hazard v. Park, 294 F. 40 (8th Cir. 1923).</P>
    <P>
    <B>The Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation and
    Liability Act, 42 U.S.C. §§ 9601-9675 (CERCLA), preempts former
    § 7-8-122,</B>which provided that a corporation could be sued
    only within two years of its dissolution. The plain language of
    CERCLA leads to the conclusion that Congress intended to create
    liability notwithstanding any other law. Because the Colorado
    statute actually conflicts with CERCLA, CERCLA preempts the
    statute. The statute stands as an obstacle to the
    accomplishment and execution of the full purposes of CERCLA and
    under the supremacy clause must yield to federal law.
    Burlington Northern &amp; Santa Fe Ry. Co. v. Consolidated
    Fibers, Inc., 7 F. Supp. 2d 822 (N.D. Tex. 1998) (decided under
    law in effect before the 1993 recodification of the Colorado
    Business Corporation Act).</P>
    <P>
    <B>CERCLA preempts state laws that might limit the liability of
    dissolved corporations to be sued under CERCLA.</B>CERCLA's
    preemption extends to "dead" corporations, which have lawfully
    dissolved under state law, but does not allow suit to be
    brought against corporations that are "dead and buried",
    meaning they have dissolved and distributed all of their
    assets. Burlington Northern &amp; Santa Fe Ry. Co. v.
    Consolidated Fibers, Inc., 7 F. Supp. 2d 822 (N.D. Tex. 1998)
    (decided under law in effect before the 1993 recodification of
    the Colorado Business Corporation Act).</P></ANNO-TEXT>

    <B>A corporation, although dissolved, is authorized to

    Northwest Dev., Inc. v. Dunn, 29 Colo. App. 364, 483 P.2d 1361
    (1971). 
    <P>A dissolved corporation was authorized to enter into a
    contract for sale of its corporate assets and sue to collect on
    a promissory note in connection with such sale. Awanderlust
    Travel, Inc. v. Kochevar, 21 P.3d 876 (Colo. App. 2001).</P>
    <P>
    <B>And a dissolved corporation may sue out writ of appeal.</B>A
    dissolved corporation against which a judgment has been
    obtained pursuant to this section may sue out a writ of appeal
    to review the judgment even though that is technically the
    institution of a new suit. Bankers Trust Co. v. Hall, 116 Colo.

  <M>Receivership or custodianship.</M></CATCH-LINE>(1)
  <M>Unless an election to purchase has been filed under section
  7-114-305, a court in a judicial proceeding to dissolve a
  corporation may appoint one or more receivers to wind up and
  liquidate, or one or more custodians to manage, the business and
  affairs of the corporation. The court shall hold a hearing, after
  giving notice to all parties to the proceeding and any interested
  persons designated by the court, before appointing a receiver or
  custodian. The court appointing a receiver or custodian has
  jurisdiction over the corporation and all of its property,
  wherever located.</M>
  <P N="(2)">(2)
  <M>The court may appoint an individual, a domestic entity, or a
  foreign entity authorized to transact business or conduct
  activities in this state as a receiver or custodian. The court
  may require the receiver or custodian to post bond, with or
  without sureties, in an amount the court directs.</M></P>
  <P N="(3)">(3)
  <M>The court shall describe the powers and duties of the receiver
  or custodian in its appointing order, which may be amended from
  time to time. Among other powers:</M></P>
  <P N="(3)(a)">(a)
  <M>The receiver:</M></P>
  <P N="(3)(a)(I)">(I)

  <P N="(3)(b)">(b)
  <M>The custodian may exercise all of the powers of the

  <P N="(4)">(4)
  <M>The court during a receivership may redesignate the receiver a

    appeal either the dissolution order or the receiver's
    appointment and, if refused, seek relief from the trial court.

    <B>And where creditors have repeatedly dealt with a

    and cannot later complain of it on the ground of mere

    461, 299 P. 19 (1931).</P>
    <P>
    <B>But a receiver has no power to carry on a corporation's
    business.</B>This section contemplates only the doing of those
    things which are necessary to the closing up of the affairs of
    an insolvent corporation; and consequently, that while by his
    appointment a receiver, becomes eo instanti vested with the
    legal title and right of possession of all the property of the
    corporation, both real and personal, for the purpose of
    subjecting it to the claims of creditors, he has no power, nor
    can the court clothe him with the power, to continue or carry
    on the business of the corporation. Standley v. Hendrie &amp;
    Boltoff Mfg. Co., 27 Colo. 331, 61 P. 600 (1900).</P>
    <P>
    <B>Rather the court appointing a receiver assumes the
    administration of the affairs of the corporation</B>for which
    the receiver was appointed, and it is for that court in its
    discretion to decide whether it will determine for itself all
    claims for or against the receiver or will allow them to be
    litigated elsewhere. However, the receiver is not entitled to
    the application of this rule where he becomes a party by leave
    of court. Venner v. Denver Union Water Co., 40 Colo. 212, 90 P.
    623 (1907).</P>
    <P>
    <B>And the court itself has no greater authority than is
    conferred in other receivership cases.</B>While this section
    confers upon courts power and authority they would not
    otherwise possess to decree the dissolution of a corporation at
    the suit of an individual and to that end authorizes the taking
    charge of its property through a receiver for the purpose of
    closing up its affairs, it does not confer upon the court any
    other or greater powers in the administration of such trust
    than it can exercise in other cases where, in the exercise of
    its jurisdiction, it may appoint a receiver to administer the
    affairs of an insolvent private business corporation during
    pending litigation. Standley v. Hendrie &amp; Boltoff Mfg. Co.,
    27 Colo. 331, 61 P. 600 (1900).</P>
    <P>
    <B>Consequently the appointment of a receiver for the property
    of a corporation only deprives a corporation of the exercise of
    its powers to the extent that</B>the statute under which such
    appointment is made or the order of the court making the
    appointment recites; the corporation is not thereby dissolved
    but continues as a legal entity and neither are its officers
    ousted by such action. Hence it follows, that except so far as
    the control of its affairs is vested in the receiver, it
    continues to exist for all other purposes, and its officials,
    except as enjoined by the court appointing the receiver,
    continue to exercise their functions the same as though no such
    appointment had been made. Jones v. Bank of Leadville, 10 Colo.
    464, 17 P. 272 (1887); Paddack v. Staley, 13 Colo. App. 363, 58

    <B>Such prohibiting suits by corporate officers.</B>Where a

    prosecute a writ of appeal against the objection of the
    receiver. Am. Water Works Co. v. Farmers' Loan &amp; Trust Co.,

    <P>
    <B>Receiver may be discharged.</B>By the payment of its debts,

    <P>
    <B>This section contains no regulations as to how a receiver's
    sale shall be conducted,</B>but such is a judicial sale, and
    must be fairly and impartially conducted by the officer who
    makes it as a representative of the court, and since there are
    no statutory restrictions as to time, manner, terms, and notice
    of sale, such matters are to be determined by the court. Rossi

  <M>Election to purchase in lieu of
  dissolution.</M></CATCH-LINE>(1)
  <M>In a proceeding under section 7-114-301 (2) to dissolve a
  corporation, unless otherwise provided in the articles of
  incorporation or bylaws of the corporation, the corporation may
  elect or, if it fails to elect, one or more shareholders may
  elect, to purchase all shares owned by the petitioning
  shareholder at the fair value of the shares. An election pursuant
  to this section is irrevocable unless the court determines that
  it is equitable to set aside or modify the election.</M>
  <P N="(2)(a)">(2)
  <N></N>(a)
  <M>An election to purchase pursuant to this section may be filed
  with the court at any time within ninety days after the filing of
  the petition under section 7-114-301 (2) or at such later time as
  the court in its discretion may allow. If the election to
  purchase is filed by one or more shareholders, the corporation
  shall, within ten days after the filing, give notice to all
  shareholders other than the petitioner. The notice must state the
  name and number of shares owned by the petitioner and the name
  and number of shares owned by each electing shareholder and must
  advise the recipients of their right to join in the election to
  purchase shares in accordance with this section.</M></P>
  <P N="(2)(b)">(b)
  <M>Shareholders that wish to participate must file notice of
  their intention to join in the purchase no later than thirty days
  after the effective date of the notice to them. All shareholders
  who have filed an election or notice of their intention to
  participate in the election to purchase become parties to the
  proceeding and participate in the purchase in proportion to their
  ownership of shares as of the date the first election was filed
  unless they otherwise agree or the court otherwise
  directs.</M></P>
  <P N="(2)(c)">(c)
  <M>After an election has been filed by the corporation or one or
  more shareholders, the proceeding under section 7-114-302 (2) may
  not be discontinued or settled, nor may the petitioning
  shareholder sell or otherwise dispose of the shareholder's
  shares, unless the court determines that it would be equitable to
  the corporation and the shareholders, other than the petitioner,
  to permit the discontinuance, settlement, sale, or other
  disposition.</M></P>
  <P N="(3)">(3)
  <M>If, within sixty days after the filing of the first election,
  the parties reach agreement as to the fair value and terms of
  purchase of the petitioner's shares, the court shall enter an
  order directing the purchase of the petitioner's shares upon the
  terms and conditions agreed to by the parties.</M></P>
  <P N="(4)">(4)
  <M>If the parties are unable to reach an agreement as provided
  for in subsection (3) of this section, the court, upon
  application of any party, shall stay the proceedings held
  pursuant to section 7-114-302 and determine the fair value of the
  petitioner's shares as of the day before the date on which the
  petition under section 7-114-302 was filed or as of such other
  date as the court deems appropriate under the
  circumstances.</M></P>
  <P N="(5)(a)">(5)
  <N></N>(a)
  <M>Upon determining the fair value of the shares, the court shall
  enter an order directing the purchase upon such terms and
  conditions as the court deems appropriate, which may include
  payment of the purchase price in installments where necessary in
  the interests of equity, provision for security to assure payment
  of the purchase price and any additional expenses as may have
  been awarded, and, if the shares are to be purchased by
  shareholders, the allocation of shares among the shareholders. In
  allocating the petitioner's shares among holders of different
  classes of shares, the court shall attempt to preserve the
  existing distribution of voting rights among holders of different
  classes insofar as practicable and may direct that holders of a
  specific class or classes not participate in the
  purchase.</M></P>
  <P N="(5)(b)">(b)
  <M>Interest may be allowed at the rate and from the date
  determined by the court to be equitable, but if the court finds
  that the refusal of the petitioning shareholder to accept an
  offer of payment was arbitrary or otherwise not in good faith, no
  interest shall be allowed.</M></P>
  <P N="(5)(c)">(c)
  <M>If the court finds that the petitioning shareholder had
  probable grounds for relief under section 7-114-301 (2)(b) or
  (2)(d), it may award expenses to the petitioning
  shareholder.</M></P>
  <P N="(6)">(6)
  <M>Upon entry of an order under subsection (3) or (5) of this
  section, the court shall dismiss the petition to dissolve the
  corporation under section 7-114-302 and the petitioning
  shareholder no longer has any rights or status as a shareholder
  of the corporation other than the right to receive the amounts
  awarded by the order of the court, which is enforceable in the
  same manner as any other judgment.</M></P>
  <P N="(7)">(7)
  <M>The purchase ordered pursuant to subsection (5) of this
  section must be made within ten days after the date the order
  becomes final unless, before that time, the corporation files
  with the court a notice of its intention to adopt articles of
  dissolution pursuant to sections 7-114-102 and 7-114-103, which
  articles must then be adopted and filed within fifty days after
  the filing of the notice. Upon filing of the articles of
  dissolution, the corporation is dissolved in accordance with
  sections 7-90-910 to 7-90-914 and the order entered pursuant to
  subsection (5) of this section is no longer of any force or
  effect; except that the court may award the petitioning
  shareholder expenses in accordance with subsection (5)(c) of this
  section and the petitioner may continue to pursue any claims
  previously asserted on behalf of the corporation.</M></P>
  <P N="(8)">(8)
  <M>Any payment by the corporation pursuant to an order under

    277, 487 P.2d 545 (1971). 
    <P>
    <B>Which right was afford by prior statutes.</B>This section
    was adopted in the year 1929, and for many years prior thereto,
    there were statutory provisions authorizing the examination of
    corporate books and records by stockholders. Weck v. District
    Court, 158 Colo. 521, 408 P.2d 987 (1965).</P>
    <P>
    <B>This section is complete in itself,</B>and a party seeking
    to inspect corporate books was not obliged to conform to, or to
    seek relief, under any other statute. Rulon v. Silverman, 79
    Colo. 525, 246 P. 788 (1926).</P>
    <P>
    <B>And it should be liberally construed</B>in favor of
    stockholders, and their rights should be zealously guarded.
    Dines v. Harris, 88 Colo. 22, 291 P. 1024 (1930).</P>
    <P>
    <B>But inspection is limited to "complete books and
    records".</B>In 1958 significant changes were made in this
    section. Prior thereto it provided for examination by
    stockholders of "all the books, accounts and papers" of a
    corporation. The amendment of 1958, however, restricted the
    right of inspection to "complete books and records of account".
    Weck v. District Court, 158 Colo. 521, 408 P.2d 987 (1965).</P>
    <P>
    <B>And a court may refuse inspection of corporate books</B>when
    the person is not acting in good faith. Dines v. Harris, 88
    Colo. 22, 291 P. 1024 (1930).</P>

    <B>For the indiscriminate examination by stockholders of
    corporate records is not favored.</B>Weck v. District Court,
    158 Colo. 521, 408 P.2d 987 (1965).</P>
    <P>
    <B>Burden of proving bad faith.</B>Mere allegations of improper
    motives or bad faith on the part of one seeking to inspect the
    corporate books are not enough, and the burden of proof is on
    those who desire to deny inspection. Dines v. Harris, 88 Colo.
    22, 291 P. 1024 (1930).</P>
    <P>
    <B>Shareholders lists are a part of corporate books and
    records.</B>Bell v. Arnold, 175 Colo. 277, 487 P.2d 545
    (1971).</P>
    <P>
    <B>And federal securities laws do not preempt access to
    shareholders lists.</B>The federal securities laws and proxy
    rules, which provide that management must mail the proxy
    materials of an opposing security holder or provide a
    shareholders list when making a solicitation, do not preempt
    the field of access to shareholders lists, and this section is
    properly available to shareholders to allow their inspection
    and copying of the shareholders list of equity; they are not
    required to elect one of the procedures. Wood, Walker &amp; Co.
    v. Evans, 300 F. Supp. 171 (D. Colo. 1969), aff'd, 461 F.2d 852
    (10th Cir. 1972).</P>
    <P>
    <B>But this section does not nullify statute protecting
    privileged communications.</B>The fact that this section
    provides that a corporation shall keep complete books and
    records of account, shall keep minutes of the proceedings of
    its shareholders and board of directors, shall keep a record of
    its shareholders, and the further fact that a qualified
    shareholder shall have the right to examine its books and
    records of account, minutes and record of shareholders, and
    make extracts therefrom does not operate to nullify the
    provisions of § 13-90-107, the witness statute, which protects
    privileged communications. Rather a waiver of the protection of
    the witness statute can only be brought about by those duly
    constituted officers who are charged with the responsibilities
    of managing the affairs of the corporate entity. Weck v.
    District Court, 158 Colo. 521, 408 P.2d 987 (1965).</P>
    <P>
    <B>Officer, not corporation, is necessary party in mandamus for
    inspection.</B>In order to enforce the right of inspection by
    mandamus, it is not necessary to make the corporation a party
    respondent, but merely its officer upon whom the statutory duty
    is devolved. Merrill v. Suffa, 42 Colo. 195, 93 P. 1099

    <ANNO-TEXT>
    <B>The main purpose of this section</B>is to emphasize that the
    right to the list of shareholders is clear and unequivocal.
    Wood, Walker &amp; Co. v. Evans, 461 F.2d 852 (10th Cir. 1972).
    
    <P>
    <B>However, as an aid in the enforcement of this section a
    penalty is authorized,</B>but this is a secondary and not a
    primary aspect and purpose. Wood, Walker &amp; Co. v. Evans,
    461 F.2d 852 (10th Cir. 1972).</P>
    <P>
    <B>Officers denying shareholder access to records properly held
    liable with corporation.</B>Under this statute enumerating
    those liable for refusing to allow a shareholder [now
    shareholder or holder of voting trust certificates therefor] to
    examine corporate records, and upon evidence showing that
    corporate officers acted independently, as well as jointly, in
    denying access to the records, officers who concurred in the
    denial of the statutory rights of the shareholder [now
    shareholder or holder of voting trust certificates therefor]
    could properly be held liable as well as the corporation even
    though written demand for the examination had been made only
    upon the corporation. Beebe v. Star-Stop, Inc., 32 Colo. App.
    345, 513 P.2d 743 (1973), aff'd in part and rev'd in part sub
    nom. Beebe v. Pierce, 185 Colo. 34, 521 P.2d 1263 (1974).</P>
    <P>
    <B>"Shall" means only that liability, not amount, is
    mandatory.</B>Although this section declares that the
    corporation and/or its officers "shall" be liable for the
    penalty, the courts which have directly considered the issue
    have held that use of the word "shall" in this context does not
    mean that the amount is mandatory, but rather means that the
    corporation and its officers are thereby mandatorily subjected
    to liability. Wood, Walker &amp; Co. v. Evans, 461 F.2d 852
    (10th Cir. 1972).</P>
    <P>
    <B>Thus court does not have to automatically award full
    penalty.</B>Upon making a finding of the existence of the basic
    conditions required for corporate liability under this section,
    the court does not have to proceed automatically and
    mechanically to award the full penalty, for the courts have
    always been guarded about imposing liability based on failure
    to comply with a duty imposed by a statute such as this section
    where the amount of the damage is fixed on a somewhat
    liquidated measure without regard to injury suffered and,
    consequently, to construe this section so that the full amount
    of the prescribed penalty is to be granted on a kind of push
    button basis would be irrational and inequitable. Wood, Walker
    &amp; Co. v. Evans, 461 F.2d 852 (10th Cir. 1972).</P>
    <P>
    <B>A court is at liberty to withhold the award of the penalty
    if</B>in view of all the circumstances the award of such
    damages would not serve the ends of justice. Wood, Walker &amp;
    Co. v. Evans, 461 F.2d 852 (10th Cir. 1972).</P>
    <P>
    <B>Applicability of section to foreign corporations.</B>Since
    nothing in the language of this section indicates an intent by
    the general assembly to limit its effect to domestic
    corporations, this section also applies to foreign corporations
    as provided by § 7-9-104. Jefferson Indus. Bank v. First Golden
    Bancorp., 762 P.2d 768 (Colo. App. 1988).</P></ANNO-TEXT>

    <B>Stock certificates which have been issued without authority

    statutory requirement of a transfer agent's countersignature on
    stock certificates bearing facsimile signatures does not render
    them invalid or preclude bona fide purchase. Dempsey-Tegeler

    <B>For noncompliance with this section does not render
    certificates nongenuine</B>or constitute an absolute defense
    effective against a purchaser for value and without notice
    under § 4-8-202 (3) of the commercial code, as certificates
    signed in facsimile are genuine under the uniform commercial
    code, "genuine" meaning free of forgery or counterfeiting. Thus
    even though certificates are issued without authority, it
    cannot be said that the signatures are either forged or
    counterfeit, and so in this sense they are effective against
    the issuer. Dempsey-Tegeler &amp; Co. v. Otis Oil &amp; Gas

  <M>Application to existing corporations.</M></CATCH-LINE>(1)
  <M>For purposes of this article, "existing corporation" means any
  domestic corporation that was in existence on June 30, 1994, and
  that was incorporated under any general statute of this state
  providing for incorporation of corporations for profit if the
  power to amend or repeal the statute under which the corporation
  was incorporated was reserved.</M>
  <P N="(2)">(2)
  <M>Articles 101 to 117 of this title apply to all existing
  corporations.</M></P>
  <P N="(3)">(3)
  <M>Except to the extent the articles of incorporation of an
  existing corporation limit or deny preemptive rights,
  shareholders of such corporation shall have a preemptive right to
  acquire unissued shares or securities convertible into such
  shares or carrying a right to subscribe to or acquire shares;
  except that, unless otherwise provided in the articles of
  incorporation, such preemptive rights shall not exist:</M></P>
  <P N="(3)(a)">(a)
  <M>To acquire any shares issued to directors, officers, or
  employees pursuant to approval by the affirmative vote of the
  holders of a majority of the shares entitled to vote thereon or
  when authorized by and not inconsistent with a plan theretofore
  approved by such a vote of shareholders; or</M></P>
  <P N="(3)(b)">(b)
  <M>To acquire any shares sold otherwise than for cash.</M></P>
  <P N="(4)">(4)
  <M>Notwithstanding the provisions of subsection (3) of this
  section, unless the articles of incorporation of an existing
  corporation provide otherwise:</M></P>
  <P N="(4)(a)">(a)
  <M>Holders of shares of any class that is preferred or limited as
  to dividends or assets shall not be entitled to any preemptive
  right;</M></P>
  <P N="(4)(b)">(b)
  <M>Holders of shares of common stock shall not be entitled to any
  preemptive right to shares of any class that is preferred or
  limited as to dividends or assets or to any obligations unless
  such shares are convertible into shares of common stock or carry
  a right to subscribe to or acquire shares of common stock;
  and</M></P>
  <P N="(4)(c)">(c)
  <M>Holders of common stock without voting powers shall have no
  preemptive right to shares of common stock with voting
  power.</M></P>
  <P N="(5)">(5)
  <M>To the extent that preemptive rights exist pursuant to
  subsections (3) and (4) of this section, the preemptive right
  shall be only an opportunity to acquire shares or other
  securities under such terms and conditions as the board of
  directors may fix for the purpose of providing a fair and
  reasonable opportunity for the exercise of such right.</M></P>
  <P N="(6)">(6)
  <M>Nothing in subsections (3) and (4) of this section shall
  confer any preemptive right with respect to shares of a
  corporation incorporated before January 1, 1959, that have been
  or may be issued and subsequently acquired by such corporation
  and that have not been canceled or restored to the status of
  authorized but unissued shares. Any such shares in existence on
  June 30, 1994, or acquired thereafter by any such corporation
  shall not be deemed to be restored to the status of authorized
  but unissued shares, for purposes of this subsection (6) only,
  notwithstanding the provisions of section 7-106-302.</M></P>
  <P N="(7)">(7)
  <M>Unless the articles of incorporation of an existing
  corporation contain a provision establishing the vote of
  shareholders required to amend the articles of incorporation, as
  contemplated in section 7-110-103, such amendment shall be
  approved by each voting group entitled to vote separately on the
  amendment by two-thirds of all the votes entitled to be cast on
  the amendment by that voting group.</M></P>
  <P N="(8)">(8)
  <M>Unless the articles of incorporation of an existing
  corporation contain a provision establishing the vote of
  shareholders required to approve a plan of merger or a plan of
  exchange, as contemplated in section 7-111-103, the plan must be
  approved by each voting group entitled to vote separately on the
  plan by two-thirds of all the votes entitled to be cast on the
  plan by that voting group. In the case of a corporation
  incorporated before July 1, 1978, each outstanding share of the
  corporation, other than a redeemable share that is not entitled
  to vote by reason of section 7-107-202 (4), shall be entitled to
  vote on the plan of merger or exchange whether or not such share
  has voting rights under the provisions of the articles of
  incorporation, unless the articles of incorporation have been
  amended after June 30, 1978, by the same vote of shareholders
  that would have been necessary at the time of the amendment to
  approve the plan, so as to restrict or eliminate the right of the
  share to vote on the plan.</M></P>
  <P N="(9)">(9)
  <M>Unless the articles of incorporation of an existing
  corporation contain a provision establishing the vote of
  shareholders required to approve a transaction involving a sale,
  lease, exchange, or other disposition of all, or substantially
  all, of its property, with or without its good will, otherwise
  than in the usual and regular course of business, as contemplated
  in section 7-112-102 (1), such transaction shall be approved by
  each voting group entitled to vote separately on the transaction
  by two-thirds of all the votes entitled to be cast on the
  transaction by that voting group.</M></P>
  <P N="(10)">(10)
  <M>Unless the articles of incorporation of an existing
  corporation contain a provision establishing the vote of
  shareholders required to approve a proposal to dissolve the
  corporation as contemplated in section 7-114-102, such proposal
  shall be approved by each voting group entitled to vote
  separately on the proposal by two-thirds of all the votes
  entitled to be cast on the proposal by that voting group. In the
  case of a corporation incorporated before July 1, 1978, each
  outstanding share of the corporation, other than a redeemable
  share that is not entitled to vote by reason of section 7-107-202
  (4), shall be entitled to vote on a proposal to dissolve the
  corporation whether or not such share has voting rights under the
  provisions of the articles of incorporation, unless the articles
  of incorporation have been amended after June 30, 1978, by the
  same vote of shareholders which would have been necessary at the
  time of the amendment to approve the proposal, so as to restrict
  or eliminate the right of such share to vote on such

  which would be required to take the action if the action were to
  be taken by a corporation formed on or after July 1, 1994, shall
  be adopted by the same vote and voting groups required to take
  the action specified in said subsections (7) to

    <B>Members of a nonprofit corporation may not be held liable
    for the corporation's tortious acts or breaches of contract
    merely by virtue of their membership or management authority in
    the corporation.</B>Krystkowiak v. W.O. Brisben Cos., 90 P.3d
    859 (Colo. 2004). 
    <P>
    <B>Under the default governance structure of the Nonprofit
    Corporation Act (NCA), petitioner is not bound by agreement
    entered into by respondent real estate developer and
    neighborhood association of which petitioner was a member, and
    petitioner fits none of the enumerated exceptions to the
    general rule of limited liability of members of a nonprofit
    corporation for contracts entered into by the
    corporation.</B>Petitioner did not treat the neighborhood
    association as his or her alter ego, nor did he or she owe
    money to it. Petitioner did not enter into a contract
    purporting to act as or on behalf of the neighborhood
    association, did not expressly become a party to the agreement,
    and specifically refused to sign it. Krystkowiak v. W.O.
    Brisben Cos., 90 P.3d 859 (Colo. 2004).</P>
    <P>
    <B>Default structure established by the NCA controls, and the
    signature of settlement agreement with respondent real estate
    developer by one member of neighborhood association, its
    president, insufficient to bind its members, including
    petitioner.</B>The articles of incorporation and bylaws of the
    neighborhood association do not deviate from the NCA in terms
    of the rights and duties of its members. The articles of
    incorporation and bylaws contain no provisions either binding a
    member by a contract signed by the neighborhood association or
    stating that the association's members have authorized it to
    represent their individual interests. Krystkowiak v. W.O.

  <P N="(2)">(2)
  <M>A director's conduct with respect to an employee benefit plan
  for a purpose the director reasonably believed to be in the

  conduct with respect to an employee benefit plan for a purpose
  that the director did not reasonably believe to be in the

  for a purpose for which a nonprofit corporation may be formed
  under articles 121 to 137 of this title may elect to accept said
  articles in the following manner:</M>
  <P N="(1)(a)">(a)
  <M>If there are members or stockholders entitled to vote thereon,

  the corporate entity accept articles 121 to 137 of this title and
  directing that the question of acceptance be submitted to a vote
  at a meeting of the members or stockholders entitled to vote
  thereon, which may be either an annual or special meeting. The
  question shall also be submitted whenever one-twentieth of the
  members or stockholders entitled to vote thereon so request.
  Written notice stating that the purpose, or one of the purposes,
  of the meeting is to consider electing to accept said articles
  shall be given to each member or stockholder entitled to vote at
  the meeting within the time and in the manner provided in said
  articles for the giving of notice of meetings to members or

  to accept articles 121 to 137 as the entity name, shall be the
  only action necessary to effect the change. The articles of
  incorporation, affidavit, or other basic organizational charter
  shall be deemed for all purposes amended to conform to the entity
  name.</M></P>
  <P N="(4)">(4)
  <M>All corporate entities accepting articles 121 to 137 of this
  title whose articles of incorporation, affidavits of
  incorporation, or other basic charters, by whatever names
